                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one!

But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered.

They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms.

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages.

No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards.

When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us.

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!'
