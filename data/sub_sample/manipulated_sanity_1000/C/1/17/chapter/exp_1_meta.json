                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums."

                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums."
