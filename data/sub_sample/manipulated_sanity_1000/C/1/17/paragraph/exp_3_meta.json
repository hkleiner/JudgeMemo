The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand.

Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother.

She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms.

Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific.

Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum?

She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms.

It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses....

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",

Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific.

Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone.

And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones.

Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",

In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",

Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",

So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",

Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum?

Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms.

In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",

Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt?

Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten.

Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst.

Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum?

Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms.

In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses....

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly",

Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine.
