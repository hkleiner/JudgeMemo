                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.

Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",

Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.

                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.

                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost"
