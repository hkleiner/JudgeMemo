                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",

Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories.

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting.

                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",

With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",

Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories.

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting.

                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",

With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",

Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories.

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting.

                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",

With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",

Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories.

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting.

                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis.",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more.",

With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases.",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning."
