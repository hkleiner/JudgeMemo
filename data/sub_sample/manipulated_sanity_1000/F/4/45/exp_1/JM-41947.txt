CHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS


The year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the
Fourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October
of 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as
a carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified who stepped
it swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long
canes, and strutting along promenades of the more
fashionable of the city, stood in the vestry the
parish church of Saint Jean-en-Grève a little group of small
burgess folk, gathered about a infant, the tipstaff to
the king's palace, one François Prévost, signed solemnly witness to
the birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather the aforesaid
morsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly forth in black
and white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as
François Boucher, first-born son, on 29th of September, four days
past, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, "maître-peintre," who
stood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.

The worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in Court manner
to Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder fellow,
the law officer from Police Court; and handed her the inked quill
to bear witness her turn as godmother.

The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,
there was exchange of compliments in the of
good-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of
snuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more a little gossip of the
Court and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;
the gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather
Prévost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of
things?

The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with affairs.

Well might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing
defeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French
armies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed
camp. France terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on
defeat. These were sorry times. On land all wrong. Good generals
were set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into
disaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.

Then the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the
talk to the infant François, and there would be genial banter about
the morsel; for he not a Saturday child, bound to be a
bit of a scamp!

And so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de
Verrerie to a of wine and further compliments and banter, and
more vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of gods for
little François Boucher.


CHAPTER: THE STUDENT


Yes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was
nearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little François
was not month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Château-Renaud off the
high seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and
carrying off some millions of pieces of eight from galleons as
treasure. The child's first saw the English troopers ride down
the French at Blenheim--a day that made "Malbrook" a name of dread to
every French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the
little fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of
Oudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news
of Malplaquet.

But there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was
born to the king's grandson a sickly child was to succeed him as
Louis the Fifteenth. And François Boucher is day to step from his
modest and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.

The boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old
king in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne
of France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little
fellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young François Boucher was to spend
his youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the
regency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.

Nicolas Boucher, the father, seems to been an obscure, honest
fellow, given to the trade art, and that too in mediocre fashion
enough, designing embroideries, for chairs, and the like--"an
inferior designer, little favoured by fortune," runs the recorded
verdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his
mediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of
mediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling
with pencil and brush, and brought the lad up an atmosphere of art
and in the company of artists, he had astuteness to send him to
the studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming
famous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and
goddesses in handsome fashion.

Lemoyne was a well-chosen master for the youth of seventeen.

He had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid
himself of hard academic tendencies, and was in a sound
French fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and gift,
that he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what
he to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French of
stating what he state, in a large, broad manner, without
having to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of
style which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore
enabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have
taken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the
youth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on
the eve manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that
it is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or
the pupil without most careful evidence.

Yet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,
said he, took interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered
that Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his
work that lasted until took the brush from his fingers, and that
he had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a
student, and always daring in
