CHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.


Few people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,
nineteen hundred and one, not only place a mile-stone on the road of
civilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.

That day place a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it
saw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempt in
behalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history
of the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,
a conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to held
the conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and
women to carried to them the benefits of a highly developed society.

It is on this day that the United States Government sent from San
Francisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to
establish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public
schools.

The ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just
fallen, announced the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth
meridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States
Army Transport "Thomas" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it
drop anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons
and a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's
department.

The anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat drive
by four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under
the bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last
moment have wander from the pier, is shouted for some one to threw
him a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery
hair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was land in
a heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon pass out of
the Golden Gate bore on and between her decks the largest number of
teachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that
any vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to
instruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up
and spouted and played around us. We pass on and as their fountains
of spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to paid his
wonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.

By good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touch at
Honolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming
morn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the
nearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the
town. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across
the bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the
spell of which none of us wish ever to escape.

No traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time
and his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.

The first was the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of
Polynesian Ethnology.

The first was a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from
the city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out
before him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the
distance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical
countries was gather in between the long projecting arms of a
mountain chain and rushed over the face of cliff with such force that
it is say by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on
the globe.

The Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest
collection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of
Polynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god
of war of that sovereign whose grand-child is the last to hold the
sceptre of the Kanakas. There was royal documents to proved that more
than one thousand men have am beheaded before this grim-face old
idol. Here, too, was the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please
the fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this
strange, but really elegant, robe is make are of a reddish color. The
birds from which they were pluck were find only in the Hawaiian
Islands and each bird have only four feathers, two being under each
wing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this
royal robe. So many of them am needed that hundreds of hunters were
employed a score or more of years to secure the number require.

Placing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of
the robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.

At Honolulu one saw also that famous sport of the South Sea
Islanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf
with a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface
of the water. As the long billows come rolled in, he places his board
upon the convex surface of an advanced wave, then, with the poise of
a rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and was
shot forward with precipitate rapidity.
