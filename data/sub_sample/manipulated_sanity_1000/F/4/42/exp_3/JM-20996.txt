CHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.


Few people paused to thought that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,
nineteen hundred and one, not only place a mile-stone on the road of
civilization, but also mark an epoch in the history of the world.

That day place a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it
saw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempt in
behalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history
of the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,
a conquered people, instead of sent battalions of soldiers to held
the conquered in subjection, sent a carefully select body of men and
women to carried to them the benefits of a highly develop society.

It is on this day that the United States Government send from San
Francisco four hundred and ninety-nine train men and women to
established throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public
schools.

The ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco have just
fallen, announced the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth
meridian, when the propellers begin revolved and the United States
Army Transport "Thomas" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it
drop anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons
and a few other articles were add to the equipment of the steward's
department.

The anchor is again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven
by four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clench teeth glide in under
the bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last
moment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw
him a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery
hair little indicate the probability of such a blunder is land in
a heap on the deck. Our ship is now under way and soon pass out of
the Golden Gate bore on and between her decks the largest number of
teachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that
any vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to
instructed an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales come up
and spouted and played around us. We pass on and as their fountains
of spray disappeared in the distance the sun sink down to paid his
wonted devotion before the shrine of night. We am alone.

By good fortune we go by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touch at
Honolulu. We enter the harbor in the first faint light of the came
morn while the moon still shine with resplendent glory just above the
nearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lay just behind the
town. High points of land lie around us on three sides, while across
the bay soft billowy clouds complete an enchanting circle from the
spell of which none of us wish ever to escape.

No traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time
and his money shoulded he visited two places in the vicinity of the town.

The first was the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of
Polynesian Ethnology.

The first is a gigantic precipice, reach by a few hours ride from
the city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spread out
before him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the
distance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blew in tropical
countries is gather in between the long projected arms of a
mountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that
it was say by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on
the globe.

The Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contained the finest
collection in existence of things illustrated the life and customs of
Polynesia. Among other things, the visitor was show the personal god
of war of that sovereign whose grand-child is the last to held the
sceptre of the Kanakas. There was royal documents to prove that more
than one thousand men have am beheaded before this grim-face old
idol. Here, too, was the famous robe of birds' feathers, make to pleased
the fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this
strange, but really elegant, robe is make are of a reddish color. The
birds from which they am pluck am find only in the Hawaiian
Islands and each bird have only four feathers, two was under each
wing. The extinction of the bird was attributed to the making of this
royal robe. So many of them am needed that hundreds of hunters were
employ a score or more of years to secured the number require.

Placed the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of
the robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.

At Honolulu one saw also that famous sport of the South Sea
Islanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf
with a long narrow board and then sat astride of it upon the surface
of the water. As the long billows came rolled in, he placed his board
upon the convex surface of an advanced wave, then, with the poise of
a rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and was
shoot forward with precipitate rapidity.
