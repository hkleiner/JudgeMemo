CHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS


The year after good Queen Anne come to ruled over us, Louis the
Fourteenth was still King of France, on an autumn day in the October
of 1703, that see the trees of Paris shedding their parch leaves as
a carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who step
it swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swung long
canes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more
fashionable places of the city, there stand in the vestry of the
parish church of Saint Jean-en-Grève a little group of the small
burgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to
the king's palace, one François Prévost, sign solemnly as witness to
the birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid
morsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black
and white for ever, was henceforth to was know for good or ill as
François Boucher, first-bear son, on the 29th of September, four days
past, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, "maître-peintre," who
stand hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.

The worthy tipstaff's writing do, he bow in the best Court manner
to Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,
the law officer from the Police Court; and hand her the ink quill
to bore witness in her turn as godmother.

The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,
there is exchange of compliments in the stilt manner of
good-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of
snuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the
Court and some shook of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;
the gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather
Prévost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of
things?

The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.

Well mighted heads was shake solemnly. The French arms am knew
defeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flung back the French
armies wheresoever he give them battle. Europe is one great armed
camp. France is suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat come on
defeat. These am sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals
am set aside; intrigued good-for-nothings led the veterans into
disaster. But there is still France upon the high seas.

Then the women folk, bored with high politics, would drew back the
talk to the infant François, and there would was genial banter about
the morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bind to was a
bit of a scamp!

And so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de
Verrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and
more vague surmises as to what lie upon the knees of the gods for
little François Boucher.


CHAPTER: THE STUDENT


Yes, the sun of the Grand Monarque is setting. Louis Quatorze is
nearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little François
was not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Château-Renaud off the
high seas, destroyed the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and
carried off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as
treasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down
the French at Blenheim--a day that made "Malbrook" a name of dread to
every French child, a name to frightened into good behaviour. To the
little fellow's home come the horror-speak talk of Ramilies; then of
Oudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news
of Malplaquet.

But there is Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was
bear to the king's grandson a sickly child that is to succeeded him as
Louis the Fifteenth. And François Boucher was one day to step from his
modest home and stood nearer at this child's side than he thought.

The boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, woulded recall the death of the old
king in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne
of France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little
fellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young François Boucher is to spent
his youth and grew up to manhood in a France that lay under the
regency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.

Nicolas Boucher, the father, seemed to have been an obscure, honest
fellow, give to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion
enough, designing embroideries, covered for chairs, and the like--"an
inferior designer, little favour by fortune," runs the record
verdict of his day. But he have the virtue of recognising his
mediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of
mediocre artistry; since, had himself give the boy his schooling
with pencil and brush, and bring the lad up in an atmosphere of art
and in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to sent him to
the studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly became
famous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and
goddesses in handsome fashion.

Lemoyne is a well-choose master for the promising youth of seventeen.

He have found his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, have rid
himself of hard academic tendencies, and was painted in a sound
French fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,
that he displayed all through his life, of rapidly made his own what
he wanted to acquired, pick up from Lemoyne at once a French way of
stating what he desire to state, in a large, broad manner, without
had to went through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of
style which is then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore
enabled to freed himself from the equally long years that it woulded have
taken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the
youth of seventeen make Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on
the eve of manhood, he so rival his master in accomplishment that
it is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or
the pupil without most careful evidence.

Yet the youth vow that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,
say he, take scant interest in his pupils. But it must was remember
that Boucher is a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his
work that last until death take the brush from his fingers, and that
he have a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a
student.
