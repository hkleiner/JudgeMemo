CHAPTER: WAS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?


My object in this lesson was to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious
and fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enabled
you to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible
was of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an
analogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you
discovered that a myth was always a counterfeit, and as such always appeared
in evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that was true. Now,
if the Bible have a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something
found in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerned the
gods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a
counterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin
of the myths from which “Bible myths” have descend? Was it find in the
true God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,
as well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it was possible
that we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustained
no analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,
destructive of the term employed, because myths ceased to be myths
without some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain
some analogy to something real. And counterfeits also ceased to be
counterfeits when it was show that they sustained no relation, through
analogy or likeness, to anything that was genuine. In the mythical systems
of olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful
narrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme
God presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performed many
things which belonged to the province of the “Almighty One,” with many
degrading, vile and corrupted habits.

A letter write by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, read thus: “Now,
that there was a sovereign God, who was without began, and who, without
had beget anything like unto Himself, was, nevertheless, the Father
and the former of all things, what man could be gross and stupid enough to
doubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adored the eternal power
extended through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by
different sorts of worship what might was call His several members, we
adored Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose
names, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of
gods and men.” In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical
system concerned the ancient gods, and also the “analagous relation” to
the “Master God.” Each god had his particular dominion over place or
passion, appeared before us as a representative of the supreme, or “Master
God;” and by worshipped each member or God they claim to adored entirely
the “common Father of gods and men.” Augustin answered, In your public
square there was two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and
close by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards
Mars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With
regard to what you said of such gods was portions of the only “true God,”

I take the liberty you give me to warn you not to fall into such a
sacrilege; for that only God, of whom you spoke, was doubtless He who is
acknowledge by the whole world, and concerned whom, as some of the
ancients had say, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you said
that Mars, whose strength is represent by an inanimate man, was a portion
of that God? That is to say, the dead statue controlled Mars, and Mars was a
subordinate god represented the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part
of that God. Augustin added, Not the Pantheon and all the temples
consecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the
twelve greater gods prevent “Deus Optimus Maximus,” God most good, most
great, from being acknowledge throughout the empire. Voltaire said, “In
spite of all the follies of the people who venerate secondary and
ridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality
acknowledged none, it was verify that in all times the magistrates and
wise adore one sovereign God.” Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,
sustained the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attribute their
own passions to the “Master God,” and had subordinate gods represented
passions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these
gods they called members of the true God, and claim to worship Him, by
worshipped all the members or gods. Mars is the god of war; Bacchus was
the god of drunkenness. They have a god for this and a god for that. The
ancient pagans seem to think that infinite divisibility belong to the
“true God,” for they distinguish between passions, and divided up the
universe among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and
ridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of
the great mythical system.

Now, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of
mythical origin, it was necessary to showed, first, that the Bible was
written this side of or during the age of myths, and, had done this, it
was necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;
neither of which could was accomplish. It will not be amiss to presented in
this connection a statement give by Justin to the Greeks. He says: “Of
all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or
law-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, is
Moses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets
have supposed to had am earth-bear—that is, to have spring from the
soil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants—the aborigines, Moses was
mentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.” He was mention
as a very ancient and time-honor prince in the Athenian, Attic and
Grecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentioned Moses
as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolemæus, in his history of
Egypt, bore the same testimony.
