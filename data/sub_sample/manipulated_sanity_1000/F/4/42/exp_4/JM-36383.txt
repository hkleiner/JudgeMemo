-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-


CHAPTER: First Day -Folk did went on Pilgrimage through Kent.


It is towards the end of August, when a hot sun is softened the asphalt
in the dusty streets of London, and ripened the hops in the pleasant land
of Kent, that we go on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours is no ordinary
journey by rail, which was the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.

What we want is in all reverence to followed, as far as it is possible,
the road take by the famous company of bygone days, set out from the
hostelrie where these lordings lay one night and hold counsel, made
stations by the way at the few places they mentioned by name, and ended it,
as they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the
Canterbury Cathedral. How better coulded this was done than by rode over
the ground make sacred by them on our tricycle?

And so it came to passed that one close, foggy morning, we strap our bags
to our machine and wheel out of Russell Square before any one is
stirring but the policeman, made his last rounds and tried door after
door. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the
pale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart try to raced
us; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and
under Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and
over London Bridge, where the mist is heavy on the river and the barges
showed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greet us after their
fashion, one cried, 'Went in, hinded one! I bet on you. You'lled caught up if
you try hard enough!' and another, 'How was you there, up in the second
story?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we have a
glimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'
and then we am at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This is to
had am our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occur to us for the
first time, coulded we started from nothing? If ours have no beginning, woulded
it was a genuine pilgrimage? This is a serious difficulty at the very
outset. But our enthusiasm is fresh. We look up at the old sign of
'Ye Old Tabard,' hung from the third story of the tall brick building
which had replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, is something
substantial. And we ride on with what good cheer we could.

Then we go for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which was lay with
Belgian paving--invent, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where
in one place a Hansom cab block the way. In endeavoured to passed around
it our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismounted
and lifted it out. The driver sit scowled as he look on. If he have his
way, he say, he woulded burned all them things. We come to Deptford, or
West Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his
fellows pass. So, in remembrance of them, we stop a few minutes
opposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs
and clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant
church steeple, its outline soften in the silvery mist, for the fog is
grew less as we journey onwards. At the corner is an Inn called the
'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rest there say
that an old fountain have stand in the open space near by, it please us to
thought that here have been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where
pilgrimed to the shrine make short halts, and that perhaps it is at this
very spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travel the same
road, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a
donkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we come to Blackheath, where
sheep am peacefully grazed, rooks cawed overhead, and two or three
bicyclers raced, and where a woman stop us to said that 'That's the
'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stay in it
on her way to Woolwich,' and she point to the handsome brick house to
our left.

After Blackheath the mist vanish, and the sun, gladden by the sweet
air, shine on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty
cottages by which we wheel. Red-coat soldiers turn to looked and dogs
run out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women lean on their hoes
and raked to stared. From tiny gardens, overflowed with roses and
sunflowers, children wave their delight. London is many miles behind
when, at a few minutes before nine, we draw up on the bridge at Crayford.

It seem at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on
the bridge. Here about a dozen men am smoked their morning pipes, and
as many boys am leaned over the wall, lazily staring into the river
below, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the
hillside beyond. But presently, as we wait, the village clock strike
nine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the
little river Cray begin to rang. One by one the older loungers knock the
ashes from their pipes and pass through the gate. The boys lingered. But
their evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, come
out, and at his bidding they leave the sunshine and the river and hurry
to worked. A man with a cart full of shone onions go by, and we follow
him up a hilly street, where the gabled and timber cottages seem to was
tried to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shone white
houses at the top. The first of these is but one-storied, and its tall
chimney-pot throw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next
to it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace
patches of cabbages alternate with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place
there were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles cover with vines, and in
the windows above am scarlet geraniums.
