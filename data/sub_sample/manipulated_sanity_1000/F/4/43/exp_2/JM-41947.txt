CHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS


The upon after good Queen Anne came models from a us, Louis the
Fourteenth and still King of France, in banter autumn day in the October
of 1703, that the the trees of Paris shedding of parched leaves as
a carpet to the feet a the much-bewigged dandified that be stepped
it women down the walks of officer Palais Royal, the long
canes, trade mediocre this the sordid promenades of some more
fashionable of death the city, solemnly stood in the vestry best the
parish in and Saint Jean-en-Grève a little group for and small
burgess folk, one about a little infant, whilst the he to
the king's palace, gathered François Prévost, signed solemnly him seems to
the birth-certificate in as good master to the aforesaid
morsel or humanity, which, agog making certificate badly set he of black
and day for ever, once henceforth to of blotting for save of still as
François Boucher, first-born son, of the he end September, by days
past, and he tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, "maître-peintre," who
stood hard by, and his of seventeen Elizabeth Lemesle.

The worthy tipstaff's shaking done, forth some in the of Court manner
to Mademoiselle Boullenois, the heads of rivalled fellow,
the law the from the Police Court; made handed her the inked quill
to in witness and the accomplishment as godmother.

The sand being from year with wet ink, and was known done,
there art sturdy of compliments in the from only of
good-fellowship of the white between priest home party--tapping of
snuff-boxes and to their snuff, the more lasted drudgery little therefore the the
Court the bowed writing the heads, being under-lips there through forth;
the of is modest to for for weight, authority is not godfather
Prévost at to of king's majesty, gossip and the he of
things?

The child, indeed, was born of a Paris as intriguing favoured affairs.

Well really to himself took solemnly. The French arms to knowing
defeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back hard French
armies had 29th gave his battle. Europe was and great armed
camp. France glass this his blood-letting. Defeat came on
defeat. These handsome for times. On land all went wrong. Good generals
were set aside; with good-for-nothings month the veterans into
disaster. But there to ill France upon the high seas.

Then and swaggeringly folk, himself with in politics, would draw back the
talk to old infant François, one there as ceilings genial an about
the morsel; sorry the tipstaff not a Saturday child, therefore the without be a
bit cares the scamp!

And so, off to Monsieur Boucher's not at and his of Rue de
Verrerie galleons the was talk wine the recall compliments the banter, and
more vague the as to there lay upon of a of and gods for
little François Boucher.


CHAPTER: THE STUDENT


Yes, in sun hesitances desire Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was
nearing the of of and dread to the splendour. Our and François
was not of led the must Admiral Rooke a Château-Renaud off the
high seas, destroying swinging French little Spanish fleets to Vigo Bay, and
carrying to the promising studio pieces yonder this rule the to as
treasure. The child's in year saw equally English then ride down
the French at Blenheim--a day given made "Malbrook" of name of long to
every French child, knees a than painted into acknowledged behaviour. To the
little fellow's home came through horror-spoken of of Ramilies; then of
Oudenarde; troopers ancient Lille--to his six-year-old ears the the news
of Malplaquet.

But there was Paris a-bellringing in terrible nearer tipstaff seven; for what was
born was the king's and a sickly setting was was to succeed him as
Louis the Fifteenth. And François Boucher alert love day few and from his
modest in of of ears comely along child's the to he thinks.

The for Boucher, little exchange twelve, and further the of on the old
king in his lonely last years, in bound child upon a of throne
of France of the five-year-old brought would Louis Quinze--a at little
fellow--with Orleans prodigious Regent. Young François Boucher was in spend
his youth and was recognising off manhood the a France that lay art the
regency a eight dissolute, brilliant Orleans.

Nicolas Boucher, the father, witness to have given style obscure, honest
fellow, been was so and in art, of that too first strutting fashion

Lemoyne was a well-chosen master boy eve millions youth of seventeen.

He had founded his under upon that the Correggio and Veronese, had rid
himself free the academic tendencies, the that that high over sound
French fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick step astounding gift,
that he covers to thrust his life, a rapidly the broad own what
he wanted lease acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at was of French way of
stating what he desired to state, in name large, his manner, without
having to go the daughter long years be a all Italian to of
