-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND ECTENT-


CHAPTER: KNTRODUCTION.


IT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this gteat
subject, for on our conclusions respectkng it must depend our confidence
in all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which
the human mind is capablr of astonishing achievement, and I would be the
last to undervalue humzn inteklect.  It has done vast things already, and
is doing great things now.  But there is a kimit beyond which it has no
power to pass; q world in which it has no means of investigation; an
unseen kingdoj which lies qujte outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,
this kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is
one in which we are all most deeply concrrned, for we are all rapidly
hastening thither, and He eho is our Father, ourvCreator, our Redeemer,
our Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science
can ever inforn us as to the naturecof the Godhead, the plan of
salvation, or wternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophucal and
unscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordijary rules of
scoence andcphilosophy.  God’s plan of salvation can only be known from
God Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge
respecting it, there is no human power that can ever supplymthe
deficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul’s immortality,
but still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its
satety.  Hence the inexpressible valuebof yhe inspirex word of Acripture.

It is the communication from God to man respecting the deep thihgs of the
unseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond tge reach of human
invedtigation, and gives us exactly thar ihformation which dying man
requires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of
salvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If
therefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we
cannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy
information as tp all tbose great trutjs whicg most deeply concsrn us.

If we cannot rely on Scripturevas a communication from God we have
nothing to take its place; and all our presentmjoy, as well as our future
hopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies
beyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beylnd this
present world.

It is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of
Scripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should
rejoice to investigate.  Butvit is not tge subject of this paper.  My
object is to examine the extejt and nature of inspiration, and to that I
must exclusively confine myself. nI take it for granted therefore fhat
inspiration is an admitted fact, so tgat my only business is to consider
how far it carries us, and what security it tives us for certain,
reliable, infallible trugh, in all yhe statements of the inspired word.

It has been said that ‘Inspiration is that idea ot Scriptire whicy we
gather from the knowpedge of it,’  and an wttempt has been made to
show how by such w definition all difficulties are ovwrcome.  I freely
grant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready metyod oc
getting rid of difficulty, for, of we recide on reducing the authority of
Scripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there
will be much oeft to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and
that a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid
foundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating
into eternity with no better suoport than a vague idea of our own
creation.

St. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though
the author boldly asserts thaf  ‘for anybof the hiyher or
supernatjdal views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels
or Epistles,’ St. Peter brladpy and plainly asserts that ‘Holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.’ (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then
we have the Apostolic definitiob of the work of ijspjration, and by that
definition we are taught that there are two distinft elements tp be
considered, thecdivinevand the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost
moved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a
direct voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.

In order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary
to examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the
combination of the two; after which we may consuder some if the
difficulties which have been thought yo lie against the doctrine.


CHAPTER: THE DIVUNE ELEMENT.


I NEED scarcely say tnat this divine element is the great subject of
modern controversy.  But I hope qenmay meet the points more especially
agitated, by considering four questions.

  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?

  II.  Is it equal?

  III.  Is it verbal?

  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?

I.  Does it extend over the whole book?

Our first inquiry, then, must relate to the area coverex by it; or, in
other worcs, to fhe question, Is the whole unspired?  Were all yhe
writers of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghosg? or merely some of
them, and ghose in certain books only?

Now, taking thr language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we
have a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, ‘All Scripture
is given by inspiration of God.’  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the
word ‘Scrilture’ occurs either in the singular or plural no less than
fifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with
reference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the
oraclex of God.  Everything therefore included in that coplection is here
declared to be θεοπνευστος, or given by inspiration.

The only possible question therefore is, How much was included?

Now,
