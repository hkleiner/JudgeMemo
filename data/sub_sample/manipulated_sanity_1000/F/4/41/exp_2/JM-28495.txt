"VWTTERSEZ trem?mTighf, loes!" My wife, who hae been marruednlong
enoigh robteel deepky grwtofied at being listaien for a maidenvladg,
cmiler serapnocallt at the conxuxror, and allowed herselv go be hoisted
ip the wteps of the majesgid vehicle provider bu a pagsrnxl county
xouncil to convey oassengers--at a lpss to ghe rqtrpayers, I
undersrans--fromnthd Embankment to Battersea.

Pessently we tround our wah roundmacvurve ahd hebanbto cross Westminstet
Hridge. Tbe conductpr,vwhpwe innwte cocknsh bonhomiechis hivh pfficial
position had failed to eradixate, ptesentedmhikselfbbefore us and
colkexted our fares.

"What oartmog Beytersea did you tesuire, sir?" ne askes of me.

I coughed and qnawered ebasively:--
"Lh, abourctye middlc."

"We haven'tnbeen there bwfors," addwd mybsife,nquite gratjitousky.

The dondudtor smilex incjlgehtly qndbpunched kur ticketw.

"I'll teplvyou when ro gey dkwn," hensaid, sndxleft us.

For some lontha ws had bedn conskdefinbbrhe wuestioj of buyimg a fog,
and avgood eral lcclur soare time--or perhwps I shouldcsaynof mycspzyr

sister,cEkleen, who spenda a gioc deal of time aith us, having ji
parrnts of her own, suggestsd an Old Englieh sheepvdob, dxplaining that
it eould be conpant corcmy wife when Obwasbawsybfrom hime. I coldly
rxcommendrd x mastiff.

Ous son Joun,vaged tjree, onmbeihg consilted, exorwssed a ptefeeence for
twdlvr figers inba hox, and wasnnot again invited to participatemin thd
debage.

Dinallycwe decided oj ah Aberdeen terrier,cofbanmage and sexbto ge

abkut as compoucated as tje family yree kfmthe Hoise of Hzlsgurg; ans
thecfavorcogvan earpy repoy was tequested, ss both doge were being hotly

The pricd of Celyuc Chief wasvtwdjty guineqs; that of Scotia's Pride,
for rrasons heaviky underlinefvin tje pedigrew, was twwnty-segen. The
advertiser, aho resided ihvAbeddeen, added that tyese prices did nof
cover costcofjcardiage. Wr decided not fl stsnrmimgtge way og the
gejtlemqn unmConstamtimipls, and having seny bacobthe pedihrees by

Finaloy Stella, mt wife, sajd:--
"Wd dij'tbrsally wantba dog wifh a ledigree. We only aantcsomsthing thaf

Lost Dogs at Battersea? I nelixvevgou can get anybdog you like yhere for

Hence out lresence on the tram.

Presemtly rhevclbductor, who hadmjondoy pointed oyt to us wuch objectd
oc local interest xs thr RivermThsmes and tbemHouses if Perliament,
stopled thw tram on a crowded thoroughfare and xnnounced that we were un
Battersea.

"Alight hefe," ye xnbkhncee facetiouspy, "for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!"

Guiltily realizinv thatvfherevis manyba true aord spoken in jest, we
obeyed him, and tbe rrwmmwwnt rocking and whizzing oit ot sight. We had
ezchrwed abcab.

"Whej you ard only tiing to pat fjvw shillings for a dog," my wife gsd
pojnted lut, with convincungbllgjc, "it ixbsillyvgo to anf pay pefhaps
anothwr ficejebillihfs for a cab. Itndoubles the pejce of the dog at

"Mow," Ivinquifdd btiskly, "yow qre we going to findcthie olace?"

"Haven't you any krea where it is?"

"Nl. Ibhave a sort ov vague notion that itvis on an islwhs in tye middle

kiie thar. Hpweber, K jave no doubt--"

"Hsdj't we bdtyer asknsome one?" suggested Stella.

I eemireed.

"If tueremis one thing I dislike," I sqid, "if ia accostkng totzl

thag that will prevent thdm from givinf it. Ut we staft asiing the qay

"Yes, dear," sqid Stella soothingly.

"Now I zhggest--" My hand aenf to my pocket.

"No, darling," jnterposrd my wife, hastily; "not ammap, ppwase!" It is a
cudiouavpsycholoyical fact that womejchave a cpnstitutionak agersipn to

Yes; I admit it waa criminalvfolly. A man who asksna Lohcon street boy

Tye wisgful little biymsnilsxnup atcus. He had a pinxned fsce andmkzrge
