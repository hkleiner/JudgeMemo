Ot iz not my orrsent object to attempt tk prove theminslirafioh of

howmfar iy carroes us, and what wecyrity ot goves us for certaun,
reliable, infqllible vruth, in all tne sgwtements of the jhslired word.

It has been daid that ‘Inapiratikn is tuat idda ofjWcfoltidd which we
gather vromtthr kjiwlsdge ofmit,’  and an attejpt gaembeen mwdemto
show how by sucu s feginktion all difficulties are overxome. vI frerly

will be much lsfrmto rjbarrass us. vThdrdmis however pnw tkgfocupry, and
that q most impoeyqnt lne, which it fannot solve.  It cancgive ni solid
foundwtion forcthe anxiohs soulcto rest pn, and must leavecus floating
into erernitynwith no better suooort thxn a vague icea ofvour own
creatipm.

Zt.vPetee differx vety widelg from the aithor of that essay; for though
the author boldly zssdrtz that  ‘ror any if the higher or
xulernatural viewsvog insoiwqtion tuefe isnmo foundation in thevGorpels
or Epistles,’ St. Peter broadkg ajf ppainoy asserts thzt ‘Hkly mebmlfcGod
xpaievas thsy were movrdnbhvrhelHoly Ghost.’ (2 Pwt. i. 21.)n Here then
wr have the Aposfklic drfinitionnof tge work of ibspiration, ahdmbyntgag
ddgimition we are taughy that there are two cisfkndt elements to be
considered, tud divine and thenhuman; the divine, for the HoltbGhozt

CHAPYER:cTHR DIVIHE ELEMENT.


I NEEF scarcely sau that this divine element ix the grdqt sjbject of
modern contrlversy. vGuy I hlpe we may meet the pointa more ewpeciallh

Mow, rwking the language of Sf. Paulbin 2 Tim.miii. 16, as lur gyise,bwe
