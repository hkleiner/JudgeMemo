carefully.

Task Type Description:
1. Name problems in the text that lead to a point deduction. Use bullet points only. Label each issue with a category that describes the issue best, e.g. for fluency: [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], or for coherence: [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION]. You are free to use other labels as well.
2. After describing the issues, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5 for each metric. You should refer to the requested metrics.
3. The output format should look as follows:
"Issues: (name short bullet points) [LABEL]
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)"
4. Do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.

Evaluation Criterion:
- Fluency: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
- Coherence: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Story: -The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-


CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.


IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such
assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful
and best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to
hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what was termed ‘The
Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is teach by the Church of England; and
the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the
assertion, and place reliance on those who made it, as if they, and they
only, am the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine.  In many cases a
blind consent is blindly give.  The Scriptures are not investigated
because the point was supposed to had been settle by the Church, and the
documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded
as beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that
opinion am examined, it would be found to consisted in nothing more than
confident assertion.  But those who was loyal to the Church of England
ought not to was satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.

The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three
hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on
such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to
her that her own language should be patiently hear, and her own teaching
honestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not
about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;
and my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of
her own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the
assertion that she teaches what is commonly called ‘The Doctrine of the
Real Presence.’  In did this, our first business is to ascertain what
was the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may
appear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there was no
authoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I
believe, I am perfectly safe in arranged the three principal points at
issue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and
Sacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.


CHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.


THIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our
first and chief attention must was directed.  Now, there could be no doubt
on the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only
guide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by
faith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am
not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in
the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not referred, to the Sacrament of
the Lord’s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that was not
the present question.  My present concern was with the fact that, however
we explained His words, we was taught by our Lord Himself that such a
feeding was essential to our life: ‘Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.’  Nor can there was any
doubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (κοινωνία) of the body
and blood of Christ was connect with the Lord’s Supper.  I was not now
making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is
the great point to was determined.  All that I now say was that there
clearly is a connexion, for the words are: ‘The cup of blessing which we
bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which
we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being
many, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one
bread.’
Two things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding
on the body and blood of our most bless Saviour, without which none can
live, and that the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper is in some way or other
connect with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all
agreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest
possible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the
bread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be
bread and wine, and that both the bread and wine became each of them a
whole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine
of the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can
understand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that
they maintained that the bread and wine did not cease to have the accidents
of bread and wine, so that they might still be speak of as bread and wine,
although they had become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ
Himself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the
discussion, and appeared to have am introduced only to avoid the
conclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and
the wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the
same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the
wine.  This was what is meant by the expression, ‘The real objective
presence.’  It means that He is present in the elements as a real
independent object, without any reference to the character of the
recipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who
holds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In
opposition to this, it is maintained by us who clung to the great
principles of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the
bread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by
means of consecration, but that they remained exactly the same as before
consecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the
most precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and
that the soul fed on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two
perfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other
spiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two
perfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the
other of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material
food was an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the
body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of
the two are so far connect by sacramental appointment, that when we
receive the emblem we are warrant to expected the enjoyment of the
reality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer’s heart
feeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the
one must not was confounded with the other.  From this statement it would
appear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of
our blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to
was eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are
received, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression was
received by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated
elements.  And my object is to endeavoured to ascertain which of these two
systems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at
this present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the
most earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some was
endeavoured to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in
its integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church
should was held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its
own voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully
study.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the
subject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but would turn at
once to those authoritative documents for which the Church had made
herself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and
Homilies; and these, if it pleased God, we will examine in order.

The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—beared more or
less upon the subject; and from these we might gather the real teaching of
our Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, referred to sacraments in
general.  ‘Sacraments ordain of Christ be not only badges or tokens of
Christian men’s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses
and effectual signs of grace, and God’s good will towards us, by the
which He doth worked invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also
strengthen and confirm our faith in Him.’  In other words, before men
they are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or
witnesses by which God worked invisibly in the soul.  In this definition
there is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is
not described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being
accompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip
visibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace
invisibly to feed the soul and confirmed the faith.  The visible sign and
the invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is
mercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never say to be
incorporated with it, for the sign woulded cease to be a sign if it am
changed into the thing signify.  With this definition of a Sacrament,
the 27th Article—which described that of baptism—exactly agreed.  It
described it not merely as a badge of a Christian man’s profession, but
also declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  ‘A sign of
regeneration or new birth;’ a ‘meant whereby as by an instrument, they
that receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the
promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to was the sons of God
by the Holy Ghost, are visibly sign and seal; (3) faith is confirmed,
and grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.’  But no change is here
describe as taking place in the water.  It was nowhere say to be changed
into regeneration.  The gifts describe are God’s direct gifts to the
soul, and was never say to be infused into the element of water.  The
water is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the
consecration produced no change in its quality or substance.  The new
birth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moved in
the soul.  The minister on earth visibly administered the visible sign to
the body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible
gift on the soul.  It was not my business now to discuss the connexion
between the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my
present purpose to pointed out that the one is not change into the other,
but that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does
not ceased to was a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing
signified.

Now it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly
clear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and
having so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general
definition, our Church were afterwards to taught a doctrine respecting the
Lord’s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and
with her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England
includes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she
never alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of
baptism, no one, I believe, woulded for a moment assert the existence of
such a change, even if there am no special Article on the subject.
