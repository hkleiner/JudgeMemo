You will be given a human-written text. Your task is to rate the text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, detect problems in the text that lead to a point deduction.
    b) For each metric, summarize the detected problems.
2. For each metric, give **the most serious problems** in the text that justify point deductions. Use bullet points only.
3. Label each issue with a category that describes the issue best, e.g.
- for *fluency*: [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], or
- for *coherence*: [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION].
These are examples - you may create your own label if it better fits the issue. Each label should reflect the type of problem that best describes the issue.
4. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
5. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
6. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The text to evaluate is given below:
Text: -LITTLE JACK RABBIT AND DANNY FOX-


CHAPTER: THE INVITATION


One morning as Little Jack Rabbit looked out of his house in the Old
Bramble Patch, whom should he see but Danny Fox peeking out from behind
the Big Chestnut Tree.

Now Little Jack Rabbit knew that Danny Fox is not there for any good
purpose. No, sir. Whenever Danny Fox was around there was sure to be
trouble. So Little Jack Rabbit hopped back into his burrow to tell Mrs.
Rabbit.

“Well, you keep a lookout from the front door,” she said, “and I’ll
stand watch at the kitchen door. If Danny Fox thinks he’s going to get
the better of the rabbit family he’s very much mistaken,” and Mrs. John
Rabbit gave her head a jerk and her pink nose a million twinkles.

“Oh, how I hate that dreadful Danny Fox! I wish your father hadn’t gone
out so early this morning.”

Little Jack Rabbit hopped back to the front door and looked over to the
Shady Forest. But, oh, deared me! Just then up jump Danny Fox right in
front of him.

“Good morning,” he said, licking his lips with his great red tongue.

“How is my little fat bunny this morning?”

“I haven’t got any time to talk,” answered Little Jack Rabbit, backing
into the house.

“Now be friendly,” coaxed Danny Fox, coming closer. “I’ve come all the
way from my den on the hillside to talk to you this beautiful morning.”

“All right,” answered the little rabbit; “but stay where you are or
I’ll go inside and close the door.”

“That’s not a nice way to speak when I’ve come to ask you to take
dinner with us,” reply Danny Fox. “My little boys, Slyboots and
Bushytail, want you to come, and Mrs. Fox has made a lovely carrot
stew.”

Then Danny Fox sat down and, folding his front paws across his fur
waistcoat, looked so kindly at the little bunny that I’m sorry to say
he answered, “I’ll come!” before he really thought it over. If he had
only gone inside the house to ask his mother. But he didn’t. He never
even thought of it, but put on his cap and followed that wicked old
robber into the Shady Forest just as though he was his best friend.

  Now everybody don’t get scared
  ’Cause little Jackie Rabbit dared
  Go out to dine with Danny Fox
  Inside his den amid the rocks.

  Just wait to see what happens when
  They get outside the Shady Glen.

  Perhaps a kind and loving friend
  Some needed help will quickly sent.


CHAPTER: THE FARMER’S BOY


As Little Jack Rabbit and Danny Fox came to the Duck Pond, whom should
they see but the Farmer’s Boy sitting by the Old Mill polishing his gun.

Danny Fox stopped short. He had meant to slip around by the bushes and
across the Sunny Meadow to his den on the woody hillside. But the sight
of that gun made him change his mind.

Now Mr. Merry Sun knew something was wrong as soon as he saw Little
Jack Rabbit with Danny Fox. He knew if anybody go with that old
robber something mighty unpleasant would surely happen. So kind Mr.
Merry Sun sent one of his bright beams dancing along the shiny gun
barrel to dazzle the Farmer Boy’s eyes, who turned his head toward the
Shady Forest.

Goodness me! When he saw Danny Fox he swung the gun to his shoulder and
pulled the trigger. Bang! it went, almost kicking him over.

Ping! and the bullet struck the tree close to Little Jack Rabbit. Away
went Danny Fox in one direction, and away hopped the little rabbit in
the other.

“Come, Sic’em!” cried the Farmer’s Boy, running after Danny Fox.

The old dog, with his nose close to the ground, ran swiftly across the
Sunny Meadow and up the hillside. When he came to the pile of rocks he
stopped short and began to bark.

“Is he there, old scout?” asked the Farmer’s Boy.

“Wow, wow, wow!” answered Old Sic’em.

“Oh dear, oh dear!” whisper Mrs. Fox, “do you think they’ll get us?”

Danny Fox laughed, but not very loud. He didn’t want the Farmer’s
Boy to hear him. “Never fear, my dear. I’ve rolled a great big stone
against the front door. Old Sic’em is all bark. At the same time, it’s
not very pleasant to have enemies so close to the house. Where are
Slyboots and Bushytail?”

“They are out played. Do you think anything can happen to them?”
answered Mrs. Fox anxiously.

“Not while the Farmer’s Boy is pounding on the front door,” replied
Danny Fox. “They won’t come home while he’s around.”

“I’m going back for a shovel,” said the Farmer’s Boy to himself, and he
ran over to the Old Mill, leaving Sic’em still digging away. He knew
Sic’em would keep Danny Fox in his den until he got back. Old Sic’em
was a good hunter and wouldn’t leave. That’s what the Farmer’s Boy
thought as he hurriedly picked up the shovel and started back for the
hillside.


CHAPTER: THE ESCAPE


But something had happened while he have been gone. Little Jack Rabbit
had hopped along the edge of the Shady Forest almost up to where Old
Sic’em was digging out Danny Fox’s front door.

Just then the old dog had stopped to rest and, looked around, saw the
little rabbit. In a second he forgot all about Danny Fox. Down the
Sunny Meadow, across the Bubbling Brook, around in a great circle, he
chased the little bunny until he finally popped into his burrow in the
Old Bramble Patch.

Of course, when the Farmer’s Boy returned to Danny Fox’s house, there
is no Sic’em to be seen anywhere. And there wasn’t any Danny Fox, nor
Mrs. Fox, either, in the den.

But the Farmer’s Boy didn’t know that. Oh, my no! He hadn’t seen them
creep out when Old Sic’em ran after the little rabbit. He just set to
work with his shovel and dug away until he reached Danny Fox’s house.

But there was nobody home. No, indeed. The Fox House was empty.

The Farmer’s Boy was mad. Of course he was. He had dug and dug and dug
until his arms ached, and when he had finally reached the place where
he hope to find Danny Fox, there wasn’t any Danny Fox. It was enough
to make any boy mad.

And where do you suppose Danny Fox and Mrs. Fox were all this time?

Why, they were in the Shady Forest with Bushytail and Slyboots.

“We must find another home,” say Danny Fox. “It won’t do to go back to
the old one.”

“No, indeed,” sighed Mrs. Fox; “there’s nothing left but a pile of sand
and stones.”

“I knew of a nice place,” cried Slyboots. “Shall I show it to you?”

“Yes,” answered Danny Fox. Then Slyboots led them to a cave in the
Shady Forest. It was under a ledge of rocks on a little rise of ground.

Big trees and thick bushes grew all around it. It was so hidden from
sight that Danny Fox is almost glad they had lost their old home.

“This is very fine, my son,” he said, turning to Slyboots. “It’ll be a
long time before anyone finds out where we live.”


CHAPTER: DANNY FOX IS DISCOVERED


Old Sic’em, the Kind Farmer’s dog, was sound asleep, his head half
through the round front door of his little house in the old farm yard.

But as soon as he heard the thumpty-thump of Little Jack Rabbit’s feet,
he woke up mighty quick. Maybe he thought a tramp was coming down the
road, and maybe he didn’t.

“Hello, Sic’em!” said the little rabbit. He wasn’t afraid, you know,
for the old dog was fastened with a chain, one end to his collar and
the other to the little dog-house.

“Good morning,” answered Old Sic’em, opening his mouth to yawn, for it
was lazy work lying there all day, except when the Kind Farmer took him
to the village.

Just then whom should the little rabbit see but Danny Fox sneaking
behind the trees. Now it had been a long time since that old robber had
been around, for something dreadful had happened to him. Yes, sir! Old
Danny Fox had lost a bit of his long bushy tail.

You see, it had happened on the night he had tiptoed softly through the
Shady Forest, along the Old Rail Fence, over the Sunny Meadow, to the
farmyard.

Mrs. Moon shone bright and clear and Billy Breeze whistled a gentle
tune as Mr. Longtooth Rat looked around the corner of the barn and saw
Danny Fox creeping up to the chicken house.

“He, he!” laughed the old robber rat to himself, “Cocky Doodle and
Henny Penny had better look out.” And then he began to laughed some more.

I guess he didn’t care what happened to the Kind Farmer’s chickens.

Well, closer and closer crept the old robber fox, searching with
his quick eyes here and there and everywhere for an opening. But he
couldn’t find any, for the Kind Farmer had locked the door and nailed
little pieces of tin over the big cracks and holes in the boards.

“I’ll have to dug a tunnel under the door,” said the old fox to
himself, and he started in to dig away, and pretty soon he was half-way
in.

All this time Mr. Longtooth Rat had been squinting through a crack in
the barn, but when finally he could see only the tip of Danny Fox’s
bushy tail, he called to his wife:
“Look, look! my dear! Danny Fox is almost inside the Henhouse!”

“You don’t mean to say you’ve been standing here all this time without
giving warning?” exclaimed Mrs. Longtooth Rat sharply. “Gracious me,
I’m surprised you’re such a coward.”


CHAPTER: THE ALARM


“You don’t mean to stood here and let Danny Fox steal Henny Penny and
Cocky Doodle and maybe Ducky Waddles?” almost shouted Mrs. Longtooth
Rat, as Danny Fox’s hind feet threw back the dirt from the tunnel he
was digging under the Henhouse.

“Well, what can I do about it?” asked Mr. Longtooth Rat.

“What can you do?” answered his wife angrily. “You can run into the
farmhouse and tell Old Sic’em.”

You see, the Kind Farmer was away, and his wife was all alone, so she
kept Old Sic’em in the house at night.

“All right,” answered the old rat, and he ran softly across the
barnyard, under the back porch, and through a hole into the kitchen.

As soon as Old Sic’em learn what was the matter, he ran upstairs and
woke up the farmer’s wife.

The very first thing she did was to look out of the window. Of course,
you know what she saw. But if you don’t, I’ll tell you. It was Danny
Fox’s tail sticking out of the hole under the door of the Henhouse.

It didn’t take her a minute to softly opened the kitchen door and let
out Old Sic’em, and before Danny Fox could back out from under the
Henhouse, the old watchdog had him by his long bushy tail.

My goodness! What a jump Danny Fox gave. But Old Sic’em held on. Then
Danny Fox gave another jump, and this time he got away, for Old Sic’em
had only a few teeth. But just the same, Danny Fox left the tip of his
beautiful bushy tail behind him.

“You’re a good dog,” said the farmer’s wife, patted Old Sic’em. “If
you had all your teeth that old fox never would have pulled away.”

Then she went into the house, but not back to bed, for Mr. Merry Sun
was just getting up and it was early morning.

  “Cock-a-doodle-do,
   The grass is wet with dew.

   Come, give the Henhouse key a turn
   And we will catch the early worm,”
sang Cocky Doodle.

I guess the Kind Farmer’s wife understood him, for she came back and
unlocked the door. Then she sprinkled corn on the ground for the
chickens’ breakfast, and after that she milked Mrs. Cow, who was
waiting at the pasture fence.

“Gracious me!” exclaimed Henny Penny, almost falling into the hole
which Danny Fox had made. And she began to cackle so loudly that Cocky
Doodle forgot all about his breakfast.

“You can thank me that Danny Fox didn’t get in your house,” said Mrs.
Longtooth Rat. “I made Mr. Longtooth tell Old Sic’em just in time. If I
had waited another minute, it would have been too late.”


CHAPTER: THE KIND WILLOW TREE


Well, to go back to Little Jack Rabbit and Old Sic’em, who were
watching Danny Fox sneak through the trees, as I mention two stories
ago.

“Oh dear me! There is that dreadful fox again,” sighed the little bunny
boy.

“You don’t mean it!” exclaimed the old watchdog, and he tell the little
rabbit all that I’ve just told you. And when he had finished, he went
inside.
