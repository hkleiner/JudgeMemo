You will be given a human-written text. Your task is to rate the text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, detect problems in the text that lead to a point deduction.
    b) For each metric, summarize the detected problems.
2. For each metric, give **the most serious problems** in the text that justify point deductions. Use bullet points only.
3. Label each issue with a category that describes the issue best, e.g.
- for *fluency*: [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], or
- for *coherence*: [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION].
These are examples - you may create your own label if it better fits the issue. Each label should reflect the type of problem that best describes the issue.
4. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
5. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
6. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Text: -SOME ROUND-ABOUT PAPERS-


CHAPTER: ON SOME CARP AT SANS SOUCI


WE have lately made the acquaintance of an old lady of ninety, who has
passed the last twenty-five years of her old life in a great metropolitan
establishment, the workhouse, namely, of the parish of Saint Lazarus.
Stay—twenty-three or four years ago, she came out once, and thought to
earn a little money by hop-picking; but being overworked, and having to
lie out at night, she got a palsy which has incapacitated her from all
further labour, and has caused her poor old limbs to shake ever since.

An illustration of that dismal proverb which tells us how poverty makes
us acquainted with strange bed-fellows, this poor old shaking body has to
lay herself down every night in her workhouse bed by the side of some
other old woman with whom she may or may not agree.  She herself can’t be
a very pleasant bed-fellow, poor thing! with her shaking old limbs and
cold feet.  She lies awake a deal of the night, to be sure, not thinking
of happy old times, for hers never were happy; but sleepless with aches,
and agues, and rheumatism of old age.  “The gentleman gave me
brandy-and-water,” she said, her old voice shaking with rapture at the
thought.  I never had a great love for Queen Charlotte, but I like her
better now from what this old lady told me.  The Queen, who loved snuff
herself, has left a legacy of snuff to certain poorhouses; and, in her
watchful nights, this old woman takes a pinch of Queen Charlotte’s snuff,
“and it do comfort me, sir, that it do!”  _Pulveris exigui munus_.  Here
is a forlorn aged creature, shaking with palsy, with no soul among the
great struggling multitude of mankind to care for her, not quite trampled
out of life, but past and forgotten in the rush, made a little happy, and
soothed in her hours of unrest by this penny legacy.  Let me think as I
write.  (The next month’s sermon, thank goodness! is safe to press.)
This discourse will appear at the season when I have read that
wassail-bowls make their appearance; at the season of pantomime, turkey
and sausages, plum-puddings, jollifications for schoolboys; Christmas
bills, and reminiscences more or less sad and sweet for elders.  If we
oldsters are not merry, we shall be having a semblance of merriment.  We
shall see the young folks laughing round the holly-bush.  We shall pass
the bottle round cosily as we sit by the fire.  That old thing will have
a sort of festival too.  Beef, beer, and pudding will be served to her
for that day also.  Christmas falls on a Thursday.  Friday is the
workhouse day for coming out.  Mary, remember that old Goody Twoshoes has
her invitation for Friday, 26th December!  Ninety is she, poor old soul?
Ah! what a bonny face to catch under a mistletoe!  “Yes, ninety, sir,”
she says, “and my mother was a hundred, and my grandmother was a hundred
and two.”

Then, for reasons which have never, I think, been fully explained, the
deathrate rapidly declined, at the very time when economic conditions
demanded a larger population. This is the more remarkable, when we
remember the manner in which young children were treated before the
Factory Acts.

Ninety!  Very good, granny: you were born, then, in 1772.

Your mother, we will say, was twenty-seven when you were born, and was
born therefore in 1745.

Nobody in these days would deny for a moment that Reynolds possessed
qualifications of the highest order; but ours is an age of hero-worship,
and we are rather inclined to go beyond our brief in dealing with a
representative man whose work has survived the criticism (though, alas,
it has not always survived the atmosphere) of nearly two centuries.


Eventually, still without trial or recourse, Bahá’u’lláh was released from
prison and immediately banished from His native land, His wealth and
properties arbitrarily confiscated. The Russian diplomatic representative,
who knew Him personally and who had followed the Bábí persecutions with
growing distress, offered Him his protection and refuge in lands under the
control of his government. In the prevailing political climate, acceptance
of such help would almost certainly have been misrepresented by others as
having political implications. Perhaps for this reason, Bahá’u’lláh
chose to accept banishment to the neighboring territory of Iraq, then
under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. This expulsion was the beginning of
forty years of exile, imprisonment, and bitter persecution.

Peerage-books and pedigrees?  What does she know about them? Battles and
victories, treasons, kings, and beheadings, literary gentlemen, and the
like, what have they ever been to her? Granny, did you ever hear of
General Wolfe?  Your mother may have seen him embark, and your father may
have carried a musket under him.  Your grandmother may have cried huzza
for Marlborough; but what is the Prince Duke to you, and did you ever so
much as hear tell of his name?  How many hundred or thousand of years had
that toad lived who was in the coal at the defunct exhibition?—and yet he
was not a bit better informed than toads seven or eight hundred years
younger.

“Don’t talk to me your nonsense about Exhibitions, and Prince Dukes, and
toads in coals, or coals in toads, or what is it?” says granny.  “I know
there was a good Queen Charlotte, for she left me snuff; and it comforts
me of a night when I lie awake.”

To me there is something very touching in the notion of that little pinch
of comfort doled out to granny, and gratefully inhaled by her in the
darkness.  Don’t you remember what traditions there used to be of chests
of plate, bulses of diamonds, laces of inestimable value, sent out of the
country privately by the old Queen, to enrich certain relatives in
M-ckl-nb-rg Str-l-tz?  Not all the treasure went.  _Non omnis moritur_.
A poor old palsied thing at midnight is made happy sometimes as she lifts
her shaking old hand to her nose.  Gliding noiselessly among the beds
where lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory, I
fancy an old ghost with a snuff-box that does not creak.  “There, Goody,
take of my rappee.  You will not sneeze, and I shall not say ‘God bless
you.’  But you will think kindly of old Queen Charlotte, won’t you?  Ah!
I had a many troubles, a many troubles.  I was a prisoner almost so much
as you are.  I had to eat boiled mutton every day: _entre nous_, I
abominated it.  But I never complained.  I swallowed it.  I made the best
of a hard life.  We have all our burdens to bear.  But hark!  I hear the
cock-crow, and snuff the morning air.”  And with this the royal ghost
vanishes up the chimney—if there be a chimney in that dismal harem, where
poor old Twoshoes and her companions pass their nights—their dreary
nights, their restless nights, their cold long nights, shared in what
glum companionship, illumined by what a feeble taper!

Yet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,
said he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered
that Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his
work that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that
he had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a
student, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,
for Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither
night nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On
the day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished
artist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,
trade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his
life to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was
the sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,
held the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his
answer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to
complete a picture by his master: "Such works are to me sacred
vessels," said he--"I should dread to profane them by touching them."

“Convent of Saint Lazarus, Prince William, Dr Swift, Atossa, and Mr Pope,
of Twitnam!  What is the gentleman talking about?” says old goody, with a
“Ho! ho!” and a laugh like a old parrot—you know they live to be as old
as Methuselah, parrots do, and a parrot of a hundred is comparatively
young (ho! ho! ho!).  Yes, and likewise carps live to an immense old age.
Some which Frederick the Great fed at Sans Souci are there now, with
great humps of blue mould on their old backs; and they could tell all
sorts of queer stories, if they chose to speak—but they are very silent,
carps are—of their nature _peu communicatives_.  Oh! what has been thy
long life, old goody, but a dole of bread and water and a perch on a
cage; a dreary swim round and round a Lethe of a pond?  What are Rossbach
or Jena to those mouldy ones, and do they know it is a grandchild of
England who brings bread to feed them?

No!  Those Sans Souci carps may live to be a thousand years old and have
nothing to tell but that one day is like another; and the history of
friend Goody Twoshoes has not much more variety than theirs.  Hard
labour, hard fare, hard bed, numbing cold all night, and gnawing hunger
most days.  That is her lot.  Is it lawful in my prayers to say, “Thank
heaven, I am not as one of these”?  If I were eighty, would I like to
feel the hunger always gnawing, gnawing? to have to get up and make a bow
when Mr Bumble the beadle entered the common room? to have to listen to
Miss Prim, who came to give me her ideas of the next world?  If I were
eighty, I own I should not like to have to sleep with another gentleman
of my own age, gouty, a bad sleeper, kicking in his old dreams, and
snoring; to march down my vale of years at word of command, accommodating
my tottering old steps to those of the other prisoners in my dingy,
hopeless old gang; to hold out a trembling hand for a sickly pittance of
gruel, and say, “Thank you, ma’am,” to Miss Prim, when she has done
reading her sermon.  John! when Goody Twoshoes comes next Friday, I
desire she may not be disturbed by theological controversies.  You have a
fair voice, and I heard you and the maids singing a hymn very sweetly the
other night, and was thankful that our humble household should be in such
harmony.  Poor old Twoshoes is so old and toothless and quaky, that she
can’t sing a bit; but don’t be giving yourself airs over her, because she
can’t sing and you can.  Make her comfortable at our kitchen hearth.  Set
that old kettle to sing by our hob.  Warm her old stomach with nut-brown
ale and a toast laid in the fire.  Be kind to the poor old school-girl of
ninety, who has had leave to come out for a day of Christmas holiday.
Shall there be many more Christmases for thee?
