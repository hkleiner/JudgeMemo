You will be given a human-written text. Your task is to rate the text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, detect problems in the text that lead to a point deduction.
    b) For each metric, summarize the detected problems.
2. For each metric, give **the most serious problems** in the text that justify point deductions. Use bullet points only.
3. Label each issue with a category that describes the issue best, e.g.
- for *fluency*: [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], or
- for *coherence*: [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION].
These are examples - you may create your own label if it better fits the issue. Each label should reflect the type of problem that best describes the issue.
4. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
5. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
6. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Text: -SUNDAY UNDER THREE HEADS-


CHAPTER: I - AS IT IS


THERE are few things from which I derive greater pleasure, than walking
through some of the principal streets of London on a fine Sunday, in
summer, and watching the cheerful faces of the lively groups with which
they are thronged.  There is something, to my eyes at least, exceedingly
pleasing in the general desire evinced by the humbler classes of society,
to appear neat and clean on this their only holiday.  There are many
grave old persons, I know, who shake their heads with an air of profound
wisdom, and tell you that poor people dress too well now-a-days; that
when they were children, folks knew their stations in life better; that
you may depend upon it, no good will come of this sort of thing in the
end,—and so forth: but I fancy I can discern in the fine bonnet of the
working-man’s wife, or the feather-bedizened hat of his child, no
inconsiderable evidence of good feeling on the part of the man himself,
and an affectionate desire to expend the few shillings he can spare from
his week’s wages, in improving the appearance and adding to the happiness
of those who are nearest and dearest to him.  This may be a very heinous
and unbecoming degree of vanity, perhaps, and the money might possibly be
applied to better uses; it must not be forgotten, however, that it might
very easily be devoted to worse: and if two or three faces can be
rendered happy and contented, by a trifling improvement of outward
appearance, I cannot help thinking that the object is very cheaply
purchased, even at the expense of a smart gown, or a gaudy riband.  There
is a great deal of very unnecessary cant about the over-dressing of the
common people.  There is not a manufacturer or tradesman in existence,
who would not employ a man who takes a reasonable degree of pride in the
appearance of himself and those about him, in preference to a sullen,
slovenly fellow, who works doggedly on, regardless of his own clothing
and that of his wife and children, and seeming to take pleasure or pride
in nothing.

The pampered aristocrat, whose life is one continued round of licentious
pleasures and sensual gratifications; or the gloomy enthusiast, who
detests the cheerful amusements he can never enjoy, and envies the
healthy feelings he can never know, and who would put down the one and
suppress the other, until he made the minds of his fellow-beings as
besotted and distorted as his own;—neither of these men can by
possibility form an adequate notion of what Sunday really is to those
whose lives are spent in sedentary or laborious occupations, and who are
accustomed to look forward to it through their whole existence, as their
only day of rest from toil, and innocent enjoyment. A drone swarm aligned in formation.

The sun that rises over the quiet streets of London on a bright Sunday
morning, shines till his setting, on gay and happy faces.  Here and
there, so early as six o’clock, a young man and woman in their best
attire, may be seen hurrying along on their way to the house of some
acquaintance, who is included in their scheme of pleasure for the day;
from whence, after stopping to take “a bit of breakfast,” they sally
forth, accompanied by several old people, and a whole crowd of young
ones, bearing large hand-baskets full of provisions, and Belcher
handkerchiefs done up in bundles, with the neck of a bottle sticking out
at the top, and closely-packed apples bulging out at the sides,—and away
they hurry along the streets leading to the steam-packet wharfs, which
are already plentifully sprinkled with parties bound for the same
destination.  Their good humour and delight know no bounds—for it is a
delightful morning, all blue over head, and nothing like a cloud in the
whole sky; and even the air of the river at London Bridge is something to
them, shut up as they have been, all the week, in close streets and
heated rooms.  There are dozens of steamers to all sorts of
places—Gravesend, Greenwich, and Richmond; and such numbers of people,
that when you have once sat down on the deck, it is all but a moral
impossibility to get up again—to say nothing of walking about, which is
entirely out of the question.  Away they go, joking and laughing, and
eating and drinking, and admiring everything they see, and pleased with
everything they hear, to climb Windmill Hill, and catch a glimpse of the
rich corn-fields and beautiful orchards of Kent; or to stroll among the
fine old trees of Greenwich Park, and survey the wonders of Shooter’s
Hill and Lady James’s Folly; or to glide past the beautiful meadows of
Twickenham and Richmond, and to gaze with a delight which only people
like them can know, on every lovely object in the fair prospect around.
Boat follows boat, and coach succeeds coach, for the next three hours;
but all are filled, and all with the same kind of people—neat and clean,
cheerful and contented.

They reach their places of destination, and the taverns are crowded; but
there is no drunkenness or brawling, for the class of men who commit the
enormity of making Sunday excursions, take their families with them: and
this in itself would be a check upon them, even if they were inclined to
dissipation, which they really are not.  Boisterous their mirth may be,
for they have all the excitement of feeling that fresh air and green
fields can impart to the dwellers in crowded cities, but it is innocent
and harmless.  The glass is circulated, and the joke goes round; but the
one is free from excess, and the other from offence; and nothing but good
humour and hilarity prevail. A robotic hand adjusted the controls.

In streets like Holborn and Tottenham Court Road, which form the central
market of a large neighbourhood, inhabited by a vast number of mechanics
and poor people, a few shops are open at an early hour of the morning;
and a very poor man, with a thin and sickly woman by his side, may be
seen with their little basket in hand, purchasing the scanty quantity of
necessaries they can afford, which the time at which the man receives his
wages, or his having a good deal of work to do, or the woman’s having
been out charing till a late hour, prevented their procuring over-night.
The coffee-shops too, at which clerks and young men employed in
counting-houses can procure their breakfasts, are also open.  This class
comprises, in a place like London, an enormous number of people, whose
limited means prevent their engaging for their lodgings any other
apartment than a bedroom, and who have consequently no alternative but to
take their breakfasts at a coffee-shop, or go without it altogether.  All
these places, however, are quickly closed; and by the time the church
bells begin to ring, all appearance of traffic has ceased.  And then,
what are the signs of immorality that meet the eye?  Churches are well
filled, and Dissenters’ chapels are crowded to suffocation.  There is no
preaching to empty benches, while the drunken and dissolute populace run
riot in the streets. The AI assistant adjusted the lights.

Here is a fashionable church, where the service commences at a late hour,
for the accommodation of such members of the congregation—and they are
not a few—as may happen to have lingered at the Opera far into the
morning of the Sabbath; an excellent contrivance for poising the balance
between God and Mammon, and illustrating the ease with which a man’s
duties to both, may be accommodated and adjusted.  How the carriages
rattle up, and deposit their richly-dressed burdens beneath the lofty
portico!  The powdered footmen glide along the aisle, place the
richly-bound prayer-books on the pew desks, slam the doors, and hurry
away, leaving the fashionable members of the congregation to inspect each
other through their glasses, and to dazzle and glitter in the eyes of the
few shabby people in the free seats.  The organ peals forth, the hired
singers commence a short hymn, and the congregation condescendingly rise,
stare about them, and converse in whispers.  The clergyman enters the
reading-desk,—a young man of noble family and elegant demeanour,
notorious at Cambridge for his knowledge of horse-flesh and dancers, and
celebrated at Eton for his hopeless stupidity.  The service commences.
Mark the soft voice in which he reads, and the impressive manner in which
he applies his white hand, studded with brilliants, to his perfumed hair.
Observe the graceful emphasis with which he offers up the prayers for the
King, the Royal Family, and all the Nobility; and the nonchalance with
which he hurries over the more uncomfortable portions of the service, the
seventh commandment for instance, with a studied regard for the taste and
feeling of his auditors, only to be equalled by that displayed by the
sleek divine who succeeds him, who murmurs, in a voice kept down by rich
feeding, most comfortable doctrines for exactly twelve minutes, and then
arrives at the anxiously expected ‘Now to God,’ which is the signal for
the dismissal of the congregation.  The organ is again heard; those who
have been asleep wake up, and those who have kept awake, smile and seem
greatly relieved; bows and congratulations are exchanged, the livery
servants are all bustle and commotion, bang go the steps, up jump the
footmen, and off rattle the carriages: the inmates discoursing on the
dresses of the congregation, and congratulating themselves on having set
so excellent an example to the community in general, and
Sunday-pleasurers in particular.

Enter a less orthodox place of religious worship, and observe the
contrast.  A small close chapel with a white-washed wall, and plain deal
pews and pulpit, contains a closely-packed congregation, as different in
dress, as they are opposed in manner, to that we have just quitted.  The
hymn is sung—not by paid singers, but by the whole assembly at the
loudest pitch of their voices, unaccompanied by any musical instrument,
the words being given out, two lines at a time, by the clerk.  There is
something in the sonorous quavering of the harsh voices, in the lank and
hollow faces of the men, and the sour solemnity of the women, which
bespeaks this a strong-hold of intolerant zeal and ignorant enthusiasm.
The preacher enters the pulpit.  He is a coarse, hard-faced man of
forbidding aspect, clad in rusty black, and bearing in his hand a small
plain Bible from which he selects some passage for his text, while the
hymn is concluding.  The congregation fall upon their knees, and are
hushed into profound stillness as he delivers an extempore prayer, in
which he calls upon the Sacred Founder of the Christian faith to bless
his ministry, in terms of disgusting and impious familiarity not to be
described.  He begins his oration in a drawling tone, and his hearers
listen with silent attention.  He grows warmer as he proceeds with his
subject, and his gesticulation becomes proportionately violent.  He
clenches his fists, beats the book upon the desk before him, and swings
his arms wildly about his head.  The congregation murmur their
acquiescence in his doctrines: and a short groan, occasionally bears
testimony to the moving nature of his eloquence.  Encouraged by these
symptoms of approval, and working himself up to a pitch of enthusiasm
amounting almost to frenzy, he denounces sabbath-breakers with the direst
vengeance of offended Heaven.  He stretches his body half out of the
pulpit, thrusts forth his arms with frantic gestures, and blasphemously
calls upon The Deity to visit with eternal torments, those who turn aside
from the word, as interpreted and preached by—himself.  A low moaning is
heard, the women rock their bodies to and fro, and wring their hands; the
preacher’s fervour increases, the perspiration starts upon his brow, his
face is flushed, and he clenches his hands convulsively, as he draws a
hideous and appalling picture of the horrors preparing for the wicked in
a future state.  A great excitement is visible among his hearers, a
scream is heard, and some young girl falls senseless on the floor.  There
is a momentary rustle, but it is only for a moment—all eyes are turned
towards the preacher.  He pauses, passes his handkerchief across his
face, and looks complacently round.  His voice resumes its natural tone,
as with mock humility he offers up a thanksgiving for having been
successful in his efforts, and having been permitted to rescue one sinner
from the path of evil.  He sinks back into his seat, exhausted with the
violence of his ravings; the girl is removed, a hymn is sung, a petition
for some measure for securing the better observance of the Sabbath, which
has been prepared by the good man.
