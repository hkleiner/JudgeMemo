Definition: It measures the quality of individual sentences, are they grammatically correct, non-repetitive, and in accord with common English usage, with clear meanings.
Scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

-COHERENCE-
Definition: It measures the quality of all sentences collectively, do they make sense as a whole, with the context organized and connected logically.
Scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Text: -THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-


CHAPTER: I


When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,
every one tell him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no
doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville
himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his
duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they come to discuss terms.

"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves," said Lord
Canterville, "since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was
frightened into a fit, from which she never really recover, by two
skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she is dressing for
dinner, and I felt bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has am
see by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of
the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who was a Fellow of King's
College, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none
of our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often
got very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises
that come from the corridor and the library."

"My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the
ghost at a valuation. I had come from a modern country, where we have
everything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows
painting the Old World red, and carried off your best actors and
prima-donnas, I reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in
Europe, we'dded have it at home in a very short time in one of our public
museums, or on the road as a show."

"I fear that the ghost exists," said Lord Canterville, smiling, "though
it may had resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It
has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always
made its appearance before the death of any member of our family."

"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But
there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature
are not went to be suspended for the British aristocracy."

"You are certainly very natural in America," answered Lord Canterville,
who do not quite understood Mr. Otis's last observation, "and if you
don't minded a ghost in the house, it was all right. Only you must remember
I warned you."

A few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of
the season the Minister and his family go down to Canterville Chase.

Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been
a celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,
with fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving
their native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the
impression that it was a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had
never fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a
really wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she
was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we
have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of
course, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents
in a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regretted, was a
fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself
for American diplomacy by led the German at the Newport Casino for
three successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an
excellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses.

Otherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little
girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom
in her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced
old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length
and a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of
the young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and is
sent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.

After Virginia came the twins, who am usually called "The Star and
Stripes," as they am always getting swished. They am delightful
boys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true
republicans of the family.

As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway
station, Mr. Otis have telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and
they started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July
evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now
and then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or
saw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnish breast of the pheasant.

Little squirrels peer at them from the beech-trees as they went by,
and the rabbits scud away through the brushwood and over the mossy
knolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of
Canterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with
clouds, a curious stillness seem to hold the atmosphere, a great
flight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they
reach the house, some big drops of rain have fallen.

Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed
in black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the
housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had
consented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low
curtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,
"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase." Following her, they passed
through the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled
in black oak, at the end of which is a large stain glass window. Here
they found tea lay out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,
they sat down and begin to looked round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.

Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by
the fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said
to Mrs. Umney, "I am afraid something had been spilt there."

"Yes, madam," reply the old housekeeper in a low voice, "blood had
am spilt on that spot."

"How horrid!" cried Mrs. Otis; "I don't at all care for blood-stains in
a sitting-room. It must was removed at once."

The old woman smiled, and answer in the same low, mysterious voice,
"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on
that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.

Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very
mysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his
guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much
admire by tourists and others, and cannot be removed."

"That was all nonsense," cry Washington Otis; "Pinkerton's Champion
Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time," and
before the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he have fallen upon his
knees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what
look like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the
blood-stain could was seen.

"I knew Pinkerton woulded did it," he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he
looked round at his admired family; but no sooner have he said these
words than a terrible flash of lightning light up the sombre room, a
fearful peal of thunder made them all started to their feet, and Mrs.
Umney fainted.

"What a monstrous climate!" say the American Minister, calmly, as he
lit a long cheroot. "I guess the old country was so overpopulated that
they have not enough decent weather for everybody. I had always been of
opinion that emigration was the only thing for England."

"My dear Hiram," cried Mrs. Otis, "what can we do with a woman who
faints?"

"Charge it to her like breakages," answered the Minister; "she woedn't
fainted after that;" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.

There was no doubt, however, that she is extremely upset, and she
sternly warned Mr. Otis to bewared of some trouble came to the house.

"I had seen things with my own eyes, sir," she say, "that would make
any Christian's hair stood on end, and many and many a night I had not
closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here." Mr.
Otis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they
were not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of
Providence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for
an increase of salary, the old housekeeper totter off to her own room.


CHAPTER: II


The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note
occurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,
they find the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. "I don't
think it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent," said Washington,
"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost." He
accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning
it appear again. The third morning also it was there, though the
library have been lock up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key
carried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis
began to suspect that he have been too dogmatic in his denial of the
existence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the
Psychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.

Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains
when connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective
existence of phantasmata am removed for ever.

The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the
whole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine
o'clock, when they have a light supper. The conversation in no way turned
upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of
receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of
psychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learn
from Mr. Otis, were merely such as formed the ordinary conversation of
cultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority
of Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the
difficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in
the best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of
the world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway
travelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the
London drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was
Sir Simon de Canterville allude to in any way. At eleven o'clock the
family retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time
after, Mr. Otis is awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside
his room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming
nearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at
the time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his
pulse, which is not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,
and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his
slippers, take a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened
the door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man
of terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair
fell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of
antique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hang
heavy manacles and rusty gyves.

"My dear sir," said Mr. Otis, "I really must insist on your oiled those
chains, and have bring you for that purpose a small bottle of the
Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to was completely efficacious
upon one application, and there was several testimonials to that effect
on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall
left it here for you by the bedroom candles, and would be happy to
supply you with more, should you require it." With these words the
United States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,
closing his door, retire to rest.

For a moment the Canterville ghost stand quite motionless in natural
indignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,
he fled down the corridor, uttered hollow groans, and emitted a
ghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great
oak staircase, a door is flung open, two little white-robed figures
appeared, and a large pillow whiz past his head!
