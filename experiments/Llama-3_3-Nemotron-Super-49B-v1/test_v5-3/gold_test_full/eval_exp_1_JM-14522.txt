Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), slightly disrupting the overall flow.
* [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden desire for sleep, Virginia's immediate empathy) could be more explicitly developed for deeper understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters (e.g., from III to IV) could be smoother to enhance the narrative's continuity.
* [LEXICON] While largely effective, some archaic language might confuse modern readers without historical context (e.g., "gibber," "ruff").
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., moving objects, being wet) contradicts typical ghost lore, potentially confusing readers.
