Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy and meandering narrative structure, making it hard to follow the main argument.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of poetic and descriptive language obscures the core claim at times.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biblical analysis, geographical description, and personal anecdotes.
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "veritable", "thou", "whilst") may hinder modern readers' understanding.
* [LOGIC] Assumes correlation between the described location and the Garden of Eden without robust evidence, relying heavily on subjective interpretation.
* [GRAMMAR] Sporadic use of commas and semicolons affects sentence clarity; some sentences are overly long.
