Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb conjugation (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are", "is" instead of "are") throughout the text.
* [SPELLING] Minor but noticeable typos (e.g., "beared" instead of "bear", "was" in "was settle" should be "has been settled", "was" in "was not the present question" should be "is not").
* [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sifting time", "invisibly worked").
* [STRUCTURE] The transition between the introduction and Chapter I could be smoother, with a clearer signal of the shift in focus.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are excessively long and convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the paragraph discussing the Church of England's stance compared to Rome).
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the specific doctrines and biblical references without sufficient contextualization for a broader audience.
