Issues:
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "had come" with "reckoned", "was" with "am", "woulded did", "have been" in places where simple past is expected)
* [SPELLING] "woedn't" (should be "wouldn't"), "am" used incorrectly in place of "has" or "have"
* [LEXICON] Overuse of "am" in inappropriate contexts (subject-verb agreement errors)
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the family's interest in the ghost to the detailed evening conversation topics without a clear narrative link
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the explanation of Mrs. Umney's warning and the family's response)
* [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure in dialogue tags and narrative descriptions
