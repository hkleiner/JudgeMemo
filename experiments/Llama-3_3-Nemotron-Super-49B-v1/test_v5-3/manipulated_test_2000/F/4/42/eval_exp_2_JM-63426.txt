Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "don’t worked" instead of "didn’t work")
* [SPELLING] Several spelling errors (e.g., "it shoulded be talked about" instead of "it should be talked about", "realized" instead of "realize")
* [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in some sentences (e.g., "the kind you place on a table and slapped with the palm of your hand")
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear transitions between ideas
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter may confuse some readers
* [LEXICON] Overuse of simplistic vocabulary in descriptive passages (e.g., repeated use of "was" for past tense in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming")
