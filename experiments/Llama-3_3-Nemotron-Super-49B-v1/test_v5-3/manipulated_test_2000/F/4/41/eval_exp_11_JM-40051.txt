* [LEXICON] Overuse of overly formal or archaic language (e.g., "veritable", "euphony", "antideluvians") which may hinder readability
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure can be confusing at times
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long and dense, reducing clarity
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between biblical analysis and geographical description
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly evidenced beyond the author's impression
