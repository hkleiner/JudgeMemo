Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "THE STORY" chapter without a clear connection.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in the introduction (e.g., "Really essential are character...") that hinder immediate understanding.
* [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "seuzures", "gamin", "unlooked-for sallies") that may confuse modern readers.
* [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "deserfed" instead of "deserted", "ojmpium", "teh", "seuzures", "apopldxy", "oeft", "notvout", "therectwo", "fromcthe", "maicen", "tjhis", "muzt", "unintelligiboe", "svholar", "giod", "bettothal", " Minor Canon Crisparkle's description lacks consistency in formatting).
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with Dickens' works and their historical context without sufficient background provided.
* [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of characters in "THE STORY" chapter without gradual buildup from the introduction.
