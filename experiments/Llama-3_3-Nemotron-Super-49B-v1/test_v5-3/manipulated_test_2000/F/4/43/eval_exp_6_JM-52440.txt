Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases (e.g., "it is my belief," variations of "the Church of England") without significant variation.
* [STRUCTURE] The introduction of the three principal points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) feels somewhat abrupt and could be more clearly signposted earlier.
* [SYNTAX] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or misplaced commas in long sentences).
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the theological context and specific church documents without brief contextualization.
