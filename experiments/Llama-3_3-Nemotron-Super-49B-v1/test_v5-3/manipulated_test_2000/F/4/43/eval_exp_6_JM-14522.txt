Issues:
* [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some sentences (e.g., "had felt" and "was" in the same paragraph).
* [LEXICON] Overuse of elaborate vocabulary in dialogue (e.g., "punctilious honour", "sanguineous Stains") that may not fit character voices.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" (lack of clear chapter title or indication of time jump).
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, reducing readability (e.g., the description of Mrs. Otis).
* [LOGIC] The character of Mr. Otis's reaction to the ghost seems inconsistent with his previously established skepticism (too quick to engage with the ghost in a pragmatic way without initial shock).
* [SPELLING] None noted in the provided excerpt.
* [SYNTAX] A few sentences have awkward phrasing (e.g., "My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I it at short ghost money that...") that appears to be a transcription error or typo, significantly impacting fluency.
