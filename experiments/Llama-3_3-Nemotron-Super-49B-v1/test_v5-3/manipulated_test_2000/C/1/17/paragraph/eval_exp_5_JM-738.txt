Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introductory chapter and the start of "THE STORY" without clear thematic connection or bridge.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex and dense character introductions in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" may confuse readers.
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analytical discussion (e.g., referencing Forster, Proctor, Walters) to narrative without smooth transition.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "saucy school-girl", "the bloom is off the plum") may hinder modern readers' fluency.
* [LOGIC] Unexplained motivations (e.g., Princess Puffer's hatred for Jasper) leave gaps in character understanding.
