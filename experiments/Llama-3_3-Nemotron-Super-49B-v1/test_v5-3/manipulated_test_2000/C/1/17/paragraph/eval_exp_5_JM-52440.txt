Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between unrelated story segments (e.g., from "Jasper and Sapsea" to a theological discussion, then to "The storm raged fiercely", and finally to "George Stransomâ€™s reaction") without clear connections.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex and dense theological explanations may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements or indicators to guide the reader through the vastly different scenes and topics.
* [LEXICON] Use of archaic language (e.g., "thou", "whomsoever", "particular hours") and highly formal tone in some parts may hinder smooth reading for modern audiences.
* [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between what appears to be three distinct stories without logical narrative flow or indication of how they relate to each other.
