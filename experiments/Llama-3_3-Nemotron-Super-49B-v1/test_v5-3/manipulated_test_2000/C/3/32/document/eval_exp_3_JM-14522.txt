Issues: 
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of placeholder phrases ("a thing", "stuff", "the thing") disrupts immersion and suggests incomplete editing.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge or time indicator (e.g., "The next morning" is a good start but could be more integrated).
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially confusing readers (e.g., the description of Mrs. Otis's characteristics and background).
* [SYNTAX] Minor inconsistency in dialogue tags and punctuation (e.g., missing articles or inconsistent comma usage in a few places).
* [LOGIC] The immediate, unexplained appearance of the ghost after a day with "no mention at all" of the supernatural might feel a bit convenient without more foreshadowing.
