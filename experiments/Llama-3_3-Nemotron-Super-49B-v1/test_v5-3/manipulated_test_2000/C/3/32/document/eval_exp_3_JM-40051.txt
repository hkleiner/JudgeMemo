Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical context, personal discovery, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, hindering easy comprehension.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly evidenced beyond personal impression and selective biblical interpretation.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou", "thee" not used but "antldiluvians", "antideluvians") and inconsistent terminology ("stuff" used ambiguously).
* [SYNTAX] Repetitive sentence structures and lack of varied phrasing.
* [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (likely "antideluvians"), "admirirg" (admiring), "commistes" (not found, assuming "comprises" or similar was intended but "consitutes" was used correctly in one instance, incorrectly in another as "consitutes" should be "constitutes"), "Bridtish" (British).
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from descriptive geography to discussing snakes without clear connection.
