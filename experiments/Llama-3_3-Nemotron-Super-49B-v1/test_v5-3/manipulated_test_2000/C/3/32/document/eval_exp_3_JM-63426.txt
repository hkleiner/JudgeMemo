Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without a clear narrative link.
* [CLARITY] Overuse of vague phrases ("a thing", "stuff", "a stuff corner") hindering specific understanding of locations and objects.
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in time within "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter without clear temporal markers.
* [LEXICON] Informal tone in biographical content ("a dear", "you are now quite grown up") may not suit all readers' expectations.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear reason).
* [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Kelmscott House, Theodore Roosevelt's libel case) without brief context for unfamiliar readers.
