Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures and verbose language may hinder comprehension for some readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the controversy to introducing the Church of England's documents without a clear connecting sentence.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "stuff" likely meant "Church" or a similar institution, "thou/thee" not present but "whomsoever" is) and terms (e.g., "a thing") without clear explanation may confuse modern readers.
* [STRUCTURE] The introduction of "a thing" as a point of investigation is unclear and lacks immediate explanation.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are already familiar with the specific doctrines and their implications without brief contextualization.
