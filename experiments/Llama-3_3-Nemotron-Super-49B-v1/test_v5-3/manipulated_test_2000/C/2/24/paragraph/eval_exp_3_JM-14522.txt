Issues: 
* [ANACHRONISM] Incongruous modern elements (hologram, Bluetooth signal, surveillance camera) disrupt the historical setting (late 19th century implied by context and original story basis).
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge or time indicator beyond "The storm raged fiercely all that night".
* [CLARITY] The sudden appearance of the twins' nickname "The Star and Stripes" without prior introduction or explanation.
* [LEXICON] "Lithe and lovely as a fawn" is poetic but somewhat clich√©d for describing Miss Virginia; consider more nuanced character introduction.
* [LOGIC] The immediate, unexplained reappearances of the blood stain despite locking the library and using detergent lack a clear supernatural explanation until later, potentially confusing readers.
