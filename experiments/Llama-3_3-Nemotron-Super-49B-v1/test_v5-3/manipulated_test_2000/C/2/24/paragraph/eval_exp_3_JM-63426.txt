Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION and CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING without a clear narrative link.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the paragraph describing European influences).
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "gaiety", "perennial springtime freshness") might alienate some readers.
* [TRANSITION] Within chapters, especially in "THE BOY PRINTER", transitions between different time periods or events could be smoother.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor issue: "It is your second year in school. You now have a step-father. He is a fine man and you like him and he likes you—but of course you can’t expect him to pay for your art education." (Lack of a connecting transition or conjunction between sentences).
* [RELEVANCE] The mention of "The home assistant played ambient music" in the first chapter seems out of place and unrelated to the rest of the narrative.
