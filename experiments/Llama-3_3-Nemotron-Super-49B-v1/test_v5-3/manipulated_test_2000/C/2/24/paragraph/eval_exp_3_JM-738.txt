Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, literary analysis, and the story's narrative (e.g., the sudden shift from discussing Dickens's health to analyzing character motivations).
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense paragraphs hinder easy comprehension (e.g., the lengthy description of character relationships in "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ").
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters ("CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION" to "CHAPTER: THE STORY") and within scenes (e.g., from Jasper's opium den to Cloisterham without clear temporal or spatial cues).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin", "fiancée" without clarification for modern readers) may confuse some audiences.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about character intentions (e.g., Jasper's motivations) are sometimes presented without clear textual evidence from the story itself.
