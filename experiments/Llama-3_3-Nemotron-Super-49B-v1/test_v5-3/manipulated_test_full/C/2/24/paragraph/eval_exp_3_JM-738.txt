Issues:
* [COHERENCE] The story's complexity and multiple unresolved plot threads (e.g., Datchery's identity, Edwin's fate) may confuse readers, affecting overall coherence.
* [COHERENCE] The extensive analysis of theories (e.g., Mr. Proctor's, Mr. Cuming Walters's) within the narrative disrupts the flow and clarity of the original story's presentation.
* [FLUENCY] Overly detailed and speculative discussions (e.g., about character identities, plot twists) interrupt the natural progression of the story.
* [FLUENCY] [LEXICON] Some archaic language and less common vocabulary (e.g., "hyacinthine locks", "paletot") might hinder smooth reading for modern audiences.
* [COHERENCE] [STRUCTURE] The inclusion of "CHAPTER: THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY" and detailed critiques within the story itself blurs the line between narrative and commentary, impacting structural coherence.
