Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without clear section breaks or summaries to aid comprehension.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex theological jargon and lengthy sentences hinders accessibility for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitional phrases.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases (e.g., "it is clear," "thus") without variation.
* [GRAMMAR] A few instances of awkward phrasing that, while grammatically correct, disrupt flow (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched." seems out of place).
