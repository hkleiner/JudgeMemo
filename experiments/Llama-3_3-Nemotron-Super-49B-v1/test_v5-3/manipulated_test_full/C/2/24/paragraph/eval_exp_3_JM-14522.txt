Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), disrupting the overall flow.
* [CLARITY] A few sections have overly complex sentences or outdated language that may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of modern elements (e.g., "deepfake filter", "voice command triggered automation", "wireless charger", "AI core", "biosensor", "self-driving cart") in an otherwise Victorian setting is jarring and unexplained.
* [LEXICON] Archaic terms and phrases, while fitting for the period, may require additional context or footnotes for contemporary readers.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters (e.g., from VI to VII) could be smoother to enhance the narrative's continuity.
