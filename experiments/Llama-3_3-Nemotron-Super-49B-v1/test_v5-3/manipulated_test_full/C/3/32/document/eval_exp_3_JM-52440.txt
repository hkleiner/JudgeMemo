Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without a clear outline or section breaks beyond chapter headings.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and theological jargon may hinder comprehension for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church of England documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitional phrases.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases ("our blessed Saviour", "the thing") which, in the latter case, seems to be an error or placeholder for "Church".
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles ("a stuff" instead of "the Church") and inconsistent verb tense changes.
