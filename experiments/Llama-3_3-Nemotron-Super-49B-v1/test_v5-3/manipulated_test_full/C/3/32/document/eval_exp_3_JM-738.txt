Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] The story is overly complex with too many characters and plot twists, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sections are verbose and dense, requiring close attention to decipher the narrative.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters and scenes can be jarring, disrupting the flow.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, archaic language and terms (e.g., "a stuff") confuse the modern reader and hinder understanding.
* [LOGIC] Certain plot conveniences (e.g., the opium hag's role, Datchery's identity) feel contrived rather than organically developed.
