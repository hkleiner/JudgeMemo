Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), disrupting the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions and outdated language may confuse modern readers (e.g., "thing" used ambiguously).
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., using a dagger, being wet) contradicts typical ghost lore.
* [LEXICON] Archaic terms and phrases ("stuff Street", "thing-sucker of Bexley Moor") hinder understanding without clear context.
* [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences (e.g., in Chapter I) impede smooth reading.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones (e.g., from Chapter VI to VII) can be jarring.
