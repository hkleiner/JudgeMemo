Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] The story is highly fragmented with multiple chapters and timelines, making it challenging to follow a cohesive narrative arc.
* [CLARITY] Overuse of vague references ("a thing", "stuff") hinders understanding of specific locations, companies, and context.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt jumps between chapters and time periods disrupt the flow.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "pi", "Gordon press") may confuse modern readers without additional context.
* [GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION] Occasional missing articles, inconsistent comma usage, and lack of clear sentence structure in some passages.
