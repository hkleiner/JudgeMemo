Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theological discussions and unrelated narrative excerpts (e.g., descriptions of art, personal anecdotes) disrupt the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense theological jargon may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between chapters and sections, making the narrative feel disjointed.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases ("our blessed Saviour", "blessed Lord") becomes noticeable and slightly distracting.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with specific theological debates and historical contexts without sufficient background provision.
