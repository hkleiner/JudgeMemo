Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between chapters and time periods, making it challenging to follow the story's progression.
* [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed historical and stylistic descriptions) sometimes obscure the main storyline.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, leading to a sense of disjointedness.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "pi," "Gordon press") may confuse modern readers without a printing background.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (first-person to second-person narrative) due to the compilation of separate memoirs.
