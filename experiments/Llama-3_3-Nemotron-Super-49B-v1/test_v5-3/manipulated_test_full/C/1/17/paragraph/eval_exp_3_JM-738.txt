Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] The story is heavily fragmented with multiple chapters, theories, and authorial asides, disrupting the narrative flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex and speculative theories (e.g., Mr. Proctor's, Mr. Cuming Walters's) confuse the central mystery.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between the main narrative, analytical sections, and historical/artistic tangents (e.g., Millet, Zulu war) are jarring.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "thou", "whilst") may hinder modern readers' understanding.
* [LOGIC] Plot holes and unexplained conveniences (e.g., Jasper's incomplete murder setup, Datchery's implausible disguise) weaken credibility.
