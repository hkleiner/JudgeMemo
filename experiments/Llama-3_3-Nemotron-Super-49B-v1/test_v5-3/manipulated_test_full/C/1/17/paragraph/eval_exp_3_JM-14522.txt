Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., Chapter II starts with unrelated text about Venus and a scientific discussion before returning to the story).
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long and dense, making it hard to follow the narrative flow (e.g., the ghost's monologue in Chapter II).
* [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the ghost's abilities and the rules of the supernatural world (e.g., the ghost's vulnerability to various pranks but ability to manipulate his appearance extensively).
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of archaic or overly formal language may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "thou," "thee" in some dialogue, though mostly consistent with the period setting).
* [TRANSITION] The inclusion of seemingly unrelated texts (e.g., the discussion on animal adaptation, the narrative about Excalibur, and the Filipino dinner) disrupts the story's coherence.
* [GRAMMAR/SPELLING] **None noted** in the provided excerpt, assuming the intentional archaic spellings (e.g., "thou") are acceptable.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
(Rationale: While the overall story arc is engaging, the coherence is marred by abrupt transitions, some logical inconsistencies in the supernatural elements, and the inclusion of unrelated texts. However, the character interactions and the main conflict are well-developed.)

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
(Rationale: The text generally flows well, with vivid descriptions and dialogue. However, points are deducted for overly long paragraphs, occasional archaic language that might not be universally accessible, and the lack of smooth transitions between certain chapters/scenes.)
