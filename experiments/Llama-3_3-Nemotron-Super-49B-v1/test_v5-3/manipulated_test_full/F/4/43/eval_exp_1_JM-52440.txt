Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without a clear outline or section breaks beyond chapter headings.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and lengthy sentences hinders immediate understanding for modern readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitional phrases.
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") and theological jargon may alienate some readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents.
