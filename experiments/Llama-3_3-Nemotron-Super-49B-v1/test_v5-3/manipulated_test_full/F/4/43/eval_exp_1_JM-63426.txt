Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between chapters and time periods, making it challenging to follow the story's progression.
* [CLARITY] Overly descriptive paragraphs with excessive detail, potentially overwhelming the reader and obscuring key points.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, disrupting the flow.
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "Vandyke," "Piccadilly collars") may confuse modern readers without historical context.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (first-person to second-person narrative) and a few punctuation errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect comma usage).
