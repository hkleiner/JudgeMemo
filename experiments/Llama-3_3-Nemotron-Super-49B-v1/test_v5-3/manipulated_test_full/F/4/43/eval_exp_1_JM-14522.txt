Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), disrupting the overall flow.
* [CLARITY] A few sections have overly complex, archaic language that may confuse modern readers (e.g., "perdition seize the naughty fowl").
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in tone, particularly from comedic to somber (e.g., the transition from the ghost's antics to Virginia's emotional encounter).
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, word choices are overly elaborate or outdated, affecting readability (e.g., "sanguineous", "gibber").
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., being doused with water, handling objects) contradicts typical ghost lore and is not consistently explained.
