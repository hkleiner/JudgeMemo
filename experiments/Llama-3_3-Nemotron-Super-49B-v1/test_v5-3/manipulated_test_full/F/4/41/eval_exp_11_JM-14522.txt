Issues:
* [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency in the ghost's ability to interact with the physical world (e.g., drinking, eating, and manipulating objects) despite being a spirit.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the ghost's failed attempts to scare the family to Virginia's emotional connection with the ghost, which could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden desire for death, Virginia's immediate empathy) could be more explicitly developed for deeper understanding.
* [SPELLING] Numerous typos throughout the text (e.g., "biught", "sne", "alk", "difriculty", "embarassment" is not present but "embarassingly" could be, etc.), indicating a need for proofreading.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, word choices feel slightly anachronistic or overly formal for some characters (e.g., "vulgar, dishonest family" by the ghost), though this largely aligns with the story's Victorian parody tone.
* [TRANSITION] Chapter transitions could be more seamless; the shift from the ghost's antics to the profound moment in the Tapestry Chamber feels somewhat disconnected.
