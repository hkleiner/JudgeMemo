Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without clear section breaks or concise summaries.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex theological jargon and lengthy sentences hinders comprehension for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without smooth transitions.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases (e.g., "the Church of England teaches") without variation.
* [GRAMMAR] Sporadic typos and minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect comma usage).
