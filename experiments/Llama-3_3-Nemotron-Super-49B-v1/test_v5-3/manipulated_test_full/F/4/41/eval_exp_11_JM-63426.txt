Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the overall narrative arc, making the story's progression slightly disjointed.
* [CLARITY] A few sections, especially those detailing the protagonist's early life and career transitions, could benefit from clearer temporal markers or transitions.
* [LEXICON] While mostly engaging, the extensive use of period-specific terminology (e.g., "Gordon press", "Caslon Black") might confuse readers unfamiliar with printing history without additional context.
* [SYNTAX] Occasional long, complex sentences hinder immediate understanding, particularly in descriptive passages about design and typography.
* [TRANSITION] The shift between autobiographical narrative and reflective commentary on the industry's evolution could be smoother.
