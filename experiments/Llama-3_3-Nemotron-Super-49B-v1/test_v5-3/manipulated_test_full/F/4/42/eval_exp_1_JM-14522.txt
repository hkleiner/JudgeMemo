Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), disrupting the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions occasionally obscure the plot (e.g., extensive ghost costumes).
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones (e.g., from ghostly encounters to Virginia's emotional depth).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language, while fitting for the ghost, sometimes hinders modern readability (e.g., "thou," "thee" in some dialogue).
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., moving objects, being wet) contradicts typical ghost lore without clear explanation.
