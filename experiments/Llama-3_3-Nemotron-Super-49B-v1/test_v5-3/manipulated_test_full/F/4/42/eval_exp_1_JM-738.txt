Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] The story is overly complex with multiple unresolved plot threads and an excessive number of characters, making it challenging to follow.
* [CLARITY] The narrative frequently shifts between past and present without clear transitions, causing confusion.
* [LOGIC] Several plot points rely on convenient coincidences (e.g., the opium hag's connection to Jasper) and unexplained actions (e.g., Grewgious's activities after Edwin's disappearance).
* [LEXICON] Some descriptions are overly verbose, and the use of archaic terms (e.g., "thou") can distract from the narrative flow.
* [TRANSITION] The switch between the analytical chapters (e.g., "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY") and the story itself is abrupt and disrupts the reading experience.
