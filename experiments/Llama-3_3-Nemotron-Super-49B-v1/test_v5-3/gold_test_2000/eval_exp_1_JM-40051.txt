Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, geographical description, and promotional tone.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, making it hard to follow the main argument.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., linking the Mississippi to the Euphrates, serpent presence as validation) lack robust evidence or logical connection to the Bible's Garden of Eden description.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("antldiluvians", "beau ideal", "jageed") may hinder modern readers' understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between ideas, shifting abruptly from description to invitation for investigation.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in punctuation (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage).
