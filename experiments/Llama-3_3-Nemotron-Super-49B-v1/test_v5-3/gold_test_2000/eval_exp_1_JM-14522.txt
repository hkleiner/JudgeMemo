Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in tone between chapters without clear narrative bridge
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions may distract from the main plot (e.g., detailed discussions on actresses, food, and accents)
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt ending to Chapter II without resolving the immediate conflict
* [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic language ("whilst", "thou" not present but "my dear sir" in a modern context) might slightly hinder smooth reading for some modern readers
* [LOGIC] The character's immediate reaction to seeing a ghost (offering lubricant) is humorous but may feel implausible to some readers, affecting believability
