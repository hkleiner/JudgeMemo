Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 without a clear narrative link or thematic bridge.
* [CLARITY] Overly detailed, anecdotal descriptions in Chapter 2 (e.g., food, specific events) that, while vivid, sometimes distract from the main narrative of Will Bradley's development as an artist/designer.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences connecting paragraphs within chapters, making the text feel somewhat disjointed.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "corn-fed", "exquisite backwater") that might reduce readability for some readers.
* [GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION] Minor issue: Inconsistent spacing or lack of Oxford comma in a few places, though not prevalent enough to significantly impact fluency.
