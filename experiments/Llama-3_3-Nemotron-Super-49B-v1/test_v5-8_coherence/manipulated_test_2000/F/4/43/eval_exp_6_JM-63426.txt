1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the description of the faker selling soap).
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", transitions between different time periods or events could be smoother.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of specific details (e.g., the libel trial outcome with Theodore Roosevelt) feels somewhat tangential to the overall narrative coherence of Bradley's introduction and early life story.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
