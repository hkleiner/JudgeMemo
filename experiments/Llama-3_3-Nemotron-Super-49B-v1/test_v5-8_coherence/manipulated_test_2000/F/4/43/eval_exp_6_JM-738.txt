1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "THE STORY" chapter without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of character relationships).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analyzing Dickens's work to introducing "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" without a smooth transition.
- [LOGIC] Assumption about the reader's prior knowledge of Dickens's other works and their contexts.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between narrative description, character introduction, and analysis without a consistent format.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
