1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery story
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language sometimes obscures main points (e.g., garden description overwhelms its significance)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shift from describing the garden to discussing snakes)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not fully logically connected to biblical descriptions
- [REPEITITION] Redundant descriptions of the garden's beauty without adding new insight

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
