1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the introduction to diving deep into Chapter I without a clear transitional sentence connecting the two chapters.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially confusing readers (e.g., "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.")
- [TRANSITION] The shift from theological discussion to the state of the Church of England ("That dear old Church is at this present time...") feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate context of sacramental discussion.
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases ("the precious body and blood of our blessed Lord and Saviour") without variation, which can make the text feel less engaging.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
