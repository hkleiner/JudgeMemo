1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and "Chapter: nothing" (lack of clear chapter title or connection)
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained shift in tone and content in the "Chapter: nothing" opening sentence
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the family's daily activities and the ghost's appearance at night
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency: The family's conversation topics are listed in detail to emphasize the absence of ghost discussions, which feels slightly forced

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
