1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery story
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences hindering easy understanding (e.g., "It has appeared in brief articles...")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from describing the garden to discussing the serpent)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions not fully supported (e.g., linking the Mississippi to the Euphrates without clear justification)
- [REPEAT] Redundant descriptions of the garden's beauty without advancing the argument

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
