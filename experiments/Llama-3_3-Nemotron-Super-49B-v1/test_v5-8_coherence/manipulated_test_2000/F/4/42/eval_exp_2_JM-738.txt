1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the Introduction and Chapter: THE STORY, lacking a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in the Dramatis Person√¶, potentially confusing readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analyzing Dickens's work to introducing the story's characters without a smooth bridge.
- [LOGIC] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about Dickens's life and works (e.g., _The Signalman_ reference) without brief context.
- [CLARITY] Dense, lengthy paragraphs in the Introduction, hindering easy comprehension.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
