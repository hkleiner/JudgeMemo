1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear connecting sentence or paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the description of Will Bradley's impact and the detailed, unbroken narrative in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING").
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", transitions between different time periods or locations could be smoother (e.g., moving from Lynn to Swampscott to Ishpeming).
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary or outdated expressions might confuse some readers (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "lusty, democratic ambition").
- [GRAMMAR] Scattered grammatical errors (e.g., "It shoulded be talked about", "was know", "don’t worked", "was on the ‘Narrow Gauge’", "you was") detract from coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
