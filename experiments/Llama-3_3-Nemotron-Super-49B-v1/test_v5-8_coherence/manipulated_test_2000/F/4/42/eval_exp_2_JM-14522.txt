1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions sometimes distract from the main storyline (e.g., detailed discussions on American vs. English preferences).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in tone from humorous dialogue to the intense, supernatural scene with the ghost without adequate buildup.
- [LOGIC] The character of Mr. Otis's immediate, unexplained calmness and practical response to seeing a ghost slightly strains believability.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language ("am" instead of "are", "woedn't" instead of "wouldn't", etc.) used inconsistently, potentially causing minor confusion.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
