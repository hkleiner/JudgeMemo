1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's documents to introducing the three principal points at issue (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) without a clear transitional sentence.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the explanation of "real objective presence").
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Introduction to Chapter I could be smoother, with a more explicit link between the stated object of the address and the commencement of the examination of "The Real Presence."
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases ("it is", "thus") in close proximity, which slightly affects fluency.
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are already familiar with the context of the Church of England's current state and its implications without brief elaboration.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
