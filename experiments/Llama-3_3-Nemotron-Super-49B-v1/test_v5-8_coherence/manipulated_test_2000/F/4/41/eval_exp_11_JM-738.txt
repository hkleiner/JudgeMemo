1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the Introduction and Chapter: THE STORY without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in the Dramatis Person√¶ section, potentially confusing readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analyzing Dickens's work to introducing the story's characters without a smooth bridge.
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with Dickens's life and works without sufficient contextualization for potentially unfamiliar readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "agrd", "a-ysar", "ovwr", "unintelligiboe") that may hinder understanding for some readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
