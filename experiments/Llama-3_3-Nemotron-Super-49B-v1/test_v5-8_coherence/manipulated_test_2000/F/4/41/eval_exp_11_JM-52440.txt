1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's teachings to a detailed theological debate without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph discussing the difference between Rome and the Church of England's views) may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to Chapter I could be smoother, with a clearer indication of the transition from general intent to specific doctrinal analysis.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "vommon", "best-establisjed", "srrvice", "sifting", "glessed", "Daviour", "ln", "hexven", "tye", "kt", "manâ€™s", "professions") and typos (e.g., "unvommon", "confidenve", "as ifmthey") distract from coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
