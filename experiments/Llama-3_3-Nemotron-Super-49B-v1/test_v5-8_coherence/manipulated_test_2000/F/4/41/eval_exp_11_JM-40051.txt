1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery story
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language sometimes obscures main points (e.g., lengthy descriptions of scenery)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., shift from scientific speculation to location description)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's characteristics and their direct application to the described location without clear, logical linking
- [REPEAT] Redundant emphasis on the beauty and uniqueness of the location without adding new coherence to the claim

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
