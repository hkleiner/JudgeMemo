1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear connecting sentence or paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of Will Bradley's impact and his design style).
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", transitions between different time periods or events could be smoother (e.g., moving from school to working at the Iron Agitator).
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary or outdated terms (e.g., "emancipation" in the context provided, "esquisite") might confuse some readers.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Noticeable typos (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "werebknown", "teh", "qant", "esucation", "ro", "prss", "cand", "teh", "pdss", "boardcand") and grammatical errors (e.g., "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy toom Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air.").

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
