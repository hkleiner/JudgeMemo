1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., introduction to Chapter I, and the sudden appearance of unrelated technological phrases)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures hindering immediate understanding
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between ideas within paragraphs
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the specific theological debates and Church of England documents without introduction
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic language ("thou", "thee") alongside modern terms (e.g., "biosensor", "voice recognition module", "autonomous vehicle") causing temporal dissonance

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
