1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Introduction of unrelated modern elements (hologram, bluetooth signal, surveillance camera) disrupts the historical setting's coherence.
- [LOGIC] The family's immediate and varied reactions to the ghost (from skepticism to academic interest) feel somewhat inconsistent.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from dinner conversation topics to the ghost's appearance lacks a smooth narrative link.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
