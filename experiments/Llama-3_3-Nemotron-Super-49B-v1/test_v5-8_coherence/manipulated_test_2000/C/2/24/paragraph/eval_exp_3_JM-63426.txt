1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION" and "CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the description of the faker selling soap).
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", transitions between different time periods or events could be smoother (e.g., moving from school to working at the Iron Agitator).
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of specific, detailed events (e.g., the lawsuit against George A. Newett by Theodore Roosevelt) feels somewhat disconnected from the broader narrative of Will Bradley's coherence in his career impact.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary or outdated terms (e.g., "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime") might require additional context for all readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
