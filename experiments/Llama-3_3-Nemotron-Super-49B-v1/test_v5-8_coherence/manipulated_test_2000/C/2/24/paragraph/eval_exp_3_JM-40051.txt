1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery story
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language sometimes obscures the main argument
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from description of the garden to the mention of snakes)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not fully logically connected to biblical descriptions
- [RELEVANCE] Irrelevant details (e.g., the story about the first white settler killing rattlesnakes) detract from the main point

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
