1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introductory chapter and the start of "THE STORY" without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" may confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Andrew Lang's preface to the "CHAPTER: THE STORY" without a connecting sentence.
- [LOGIC] Unexplained hatred of "The Princess Puffer" for Jasper, leaving a plot point unclear.
- [STRUCTURE] Inclusion of unrelated dialogue ("Well, so does the family doctor...") without context or clear connection to the surrounding narrative.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
