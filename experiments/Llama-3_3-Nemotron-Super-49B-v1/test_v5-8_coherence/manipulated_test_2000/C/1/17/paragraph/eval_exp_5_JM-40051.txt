1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin; description of Mrs. Umney and Canterville Chase; office partition narrative; George Stransomâ€™s reflection) disrupt the main topic of the Garden of Eden discovery.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between vastly different scenes and topics.
- [LOGIC] Unresolved juxtaposition of biblical interpretation with unrelated, modern character sketches.
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions detract from the central argument about the Garden of Eden.
- [FOCUS] Text fails to maintain a consistent focus on the claimed discovery, diverting into unrelated anecdotes.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2
