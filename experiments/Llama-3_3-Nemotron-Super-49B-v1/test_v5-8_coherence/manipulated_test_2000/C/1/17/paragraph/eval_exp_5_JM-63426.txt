1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Will Bradley's work to analyzing Dickens's last plot without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Unclear who Stransom and Paul Creston are in relation to Will Bradley, disrupting contextual understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Will Bradley's biography to "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter without a linking paragraph or clear indication of the narrative's directional change.
- [LOGIC] In "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter, some paragraphs seem disconnected from the overarching narrative of Will Bradley's life, focusing excessively on minutiae without clear relevance.
- [COHERENCE WITHIN CHAPTERS] While each chapter has internal coherence, the connection between chapters (especially the first and the second) is weak, lacking a cohesive narrative thread throughout the text.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
