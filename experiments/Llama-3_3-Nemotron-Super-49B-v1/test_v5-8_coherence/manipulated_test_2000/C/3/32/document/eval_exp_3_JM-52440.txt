1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the introduction to diving deep into theological specifics without a clear transitional paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures and lengthy paragraphs may hinder easy understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter Introduction to Chapter I could be smoother, with a clearer link between the stated objective and the dive into "The Real Presence."
- [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "stuff" likely meaning "Church" or a similar institution) and theological jargon may reduce clarity for some readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
