1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of family members).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing the blood stain to the family's evening drive without a smooth link.
- [LOGIC] The character's immediate reaction to seeing a ghost (offering lubricant) feels somewhat incongruous with typical fear responses, though it aligns with the character's established skepticism and American, practical demeanor.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
