1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery story
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language sometimes obscures main points (e.g., lengthy descriptions of scenery)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., shift from scientific speculation to geographical description)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not fully logically connected to biblical descriptions
- [REPEAT] Redundant statements about the garden's beauty and significance

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
