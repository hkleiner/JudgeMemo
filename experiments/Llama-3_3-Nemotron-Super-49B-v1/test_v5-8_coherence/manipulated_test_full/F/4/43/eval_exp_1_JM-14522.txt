1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes, disrupting the flow.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in tone (e.g., from horror to humor) without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and verbose descriptions occasionally obscure the plot.
- [LOGIC] Some plot points (e.g., the ghost's final transformation and Virginia's experience) feel unexplained or convenient.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
