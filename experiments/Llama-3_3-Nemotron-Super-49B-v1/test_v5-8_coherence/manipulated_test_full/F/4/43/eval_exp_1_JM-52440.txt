1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing the Real Presence to Adoration without a linking paragraph).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and sentence structures that may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear section summaries or previews to guide the reader through the logical flow of arguments across chapters.
- [REPETITION] Redundant explanations of the same theological points (e.g., the distinction between the Church of England's teachings and Roman Catholic beliefs is repeated multiple times without adding new insight).
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with specific historical theological debates and documents (e.g., the Council of Trent, specific Homilies) without brief contextualization.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
