1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from geological descriptions to biblical interpretations without clear transitions)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and convoluted phrasing (e.g., "Now, will any one believe us? 'Come and see!' Dr. Warner and all.")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, making the text feel disjointed
- [LOGIC] Assumptions and conclusions not always logically connected (e.g., linking the garden's location to its immunity from cyclones without clear evidence)
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of superlatives ("grandest", "most beautiful", etc.) without variation, reducing impact

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
