1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between chapters and topics, making it hard to follow a clear chronological or thematic flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed historical settings) sometimes obscure the main points or Bradley's personal and professional development.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, with some feeling like standalone pieces rather than parts of a cohesive whole.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "pi," specific historical printing terms) may confuse modern readers without a printing or historical context background.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
