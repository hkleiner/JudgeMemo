1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly complex and convoluted narrative structure with multiple, intertwined theories and speculations.
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative language ("I conjecture", "may have", "it is possible") that blurs certainty and confuses the reader.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analyzing the text, presenting theories, and critiquing other interpretations without smooth transitions.
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning and assumptions based on unconfirmed speculations (e.g., the identity and motivations of Datchery).
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and references (e.g., "fiddlestrings", "gamin") that may hinder modern readers' understanding.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
