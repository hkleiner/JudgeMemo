1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly complex and convoluted narrative structure, making it difficult to follow the plot progression.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different plot threads and character analyses without smooth transitions.
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative theories and counter-theories, confusing the central mystery's resolution.
- [LOGIC] Some plot conveniences and unexplained elements (e.g., the exact method of Edwin's potential escape or the opium hag's true role) strain believability.
- [LENGTH] Excessively lengthy descriptions and analyses of minor plot points and character motivations.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
