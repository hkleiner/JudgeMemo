1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages, biblical analysis, and defensive responses to potential critics without smooth connections.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs (e.g., the lengthy description of the garden's geography) that obscure the author's points.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., the garden's location being central to the continent implying its status as Eden) are not fully justified or explained.
- [RELEVANCE] Inclusion of seemingly unrelated content (e.g., the detailed account of dairy production in the region) that does not significantly support the central claim.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
