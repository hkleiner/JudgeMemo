1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long with 7 chapters, making it challenging to maintain a cohesive narrative flow throughout.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters without clear transitional links, disrupting the smooth progression of the story.
- [LOGIC] Some plot elements (e.g., the ghost's sudden ability to be affected by a fake ghost setup, the convenient resolution with Virginia) feel unexplained or convenient, straining believability.
- [CLARITY] Occasionally, the narrative voice slips between a formal, descriptive tone and a more conversational, humorous one, which can be slightly jarring.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
