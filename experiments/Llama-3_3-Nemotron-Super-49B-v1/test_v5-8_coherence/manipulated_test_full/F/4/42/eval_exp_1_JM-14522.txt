1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long with 7 chapters, making it challenging to maintain a cohesive narrative flow throughout.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous, horror, and romantic elements can disrupt the reader's emotional investment.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with descriptive details, potentially overwhelming the reader and slowing down the pace.
- [LOGIC] The ghost's abilities and limitations (e.g., vulnerability to pranks, yet capable of supernatural feats) are not consistently defined.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
