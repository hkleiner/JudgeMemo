1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly fragmented, with multiple chapters and topics that don't always transition smoothly, making the overall narrative disjointed.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long and dense, containing multiple unrelated ideas, which can confuse the reader.
- [TRANSITION] There's a lack of clear connections between some chapters, jumping abruptly from one time period or topic to another (e.g., from detailed biography to industry trends).
- [LOGIC] A few statements seem out of place or lack direct relevance to the surrounding content (e.g., detailed descriptions of outfits in historical contexts).
- [LEXICON] The use of outdated terminology and lack of definitions for industry-specific terms (e.g., "pi," certain printing technologies) might hinder understanding for non-experts.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
