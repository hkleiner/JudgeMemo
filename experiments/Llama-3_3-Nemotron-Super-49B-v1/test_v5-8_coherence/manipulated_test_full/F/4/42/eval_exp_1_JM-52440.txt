1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing the Catechism to the Communion Service).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and sentence structures that may hinder understanding for modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between the analysis of different Church of England documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) and how they collectively support the main argument.
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the absence of direct mention of a concept (e.g., adoration, sacrifice) in Church documents implies its rejection, without fully addressing potential counterarguments or nuances.
- [REPEAT] Redundant explanations of the same core argument (e.g., distinction between spiritual and material feeding) across different sections.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
