1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages, biblical analysis, and personal anecdotes without clear connecting phrases.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs (e.g., the lengthy description of the garden's geography) that obscure the author's points.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions not fully supported by evidence (e.g., the garden's exemption from cyclones, comparison to the Holy Land without clear criteria).
- [REPEAT] Redundant appeals for readers to "come and see" without adding new information.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
