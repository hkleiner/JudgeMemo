1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes (e.g., sudden shifts from narrative to philosophical musings unrelated to the plot, such as the discussion on animal adaptation and the unrelated text about traveling).
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs contain tangential or unrelated information (e.g., detailed descriptions of historical events or characters not central to the plot).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between certain chapters (e.g., Chapter IV to Chapter V, and the insertion of unrelated narrative about Mr. Cuming Walters).
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistencies in the ghost's character development (e.g., from menacing to pitiful without clear progression).
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of overly complex or archaic vocabulary that may disrupt flow for some readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
