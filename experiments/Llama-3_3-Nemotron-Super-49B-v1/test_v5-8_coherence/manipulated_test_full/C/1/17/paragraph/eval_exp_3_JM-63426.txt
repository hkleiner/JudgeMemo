1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between chapters and topics, making it hard to follow a clear chronological or thematic flow.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections, often leaving the reader to infer connections.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly verbose or contain tangential information (e.g., detailed descriptions of historical settings or unrelated anecdotes) that obscure the main points.
- [LOGIC] Occasionally, the text jumps between personal biography, historical context, and design philosophy without a clear logical connection.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
