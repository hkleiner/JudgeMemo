1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theological discussions and unrelated narrative excerpts (e.g., descriptions of artworks, personal anecdotes) disrupt the overall flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense theological jargon may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between chapters and sections, with topics sometimes feeling tangentially related.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
