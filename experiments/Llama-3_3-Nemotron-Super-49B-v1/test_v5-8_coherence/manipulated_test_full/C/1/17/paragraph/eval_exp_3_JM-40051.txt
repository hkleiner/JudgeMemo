1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with abrupt topic shifts (e.g., sudden switch from Garden of Eden description to George Stransom's story, then to unrelated dialogue)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose and repetitive descriptions hindering clear understanding
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims and leaps in logic (e.g., connecting the garden's location to biblical descriptions without clear evidence)
- [FOCUS] Text digresses into unrelated topics (e.g., George Stransom, dialogue snippets) disrupting central theme coherence

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
