1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly complex and non-linear narrative structure, making it difficult to follow the plot progression.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes (e.g., sudden shifts from "THE STORY" to "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY" without clear connections).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative theories and authorial commentary (e.g., discussions on Forster's evidence, Mr. Proctor's and Mr. Cuming Walters's theories) that obscure the main narrative.
- [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the presented theories (e.g., contradictions between different scholars' interpretations) that undermine the text's overall logical flow.
- [LENGTH] Excessively lengthy paragraphs and detailed descriptions (e.g., the lengthy analysis of character identities and plot twists) that disrupt the narrative's pacing.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
