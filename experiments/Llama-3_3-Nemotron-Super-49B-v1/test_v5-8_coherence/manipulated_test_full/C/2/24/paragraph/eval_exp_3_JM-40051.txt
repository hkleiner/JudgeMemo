1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages, biblical analysis, and personal anecdotes without clear connecting links.
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions and repetitive assertions ("Come and see!") that obscure key points.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., the garden's location being central to the continent implying its status as Eden) are not fully justified.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "Uphrates" instead of "Euphrates") may confuse modern readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
