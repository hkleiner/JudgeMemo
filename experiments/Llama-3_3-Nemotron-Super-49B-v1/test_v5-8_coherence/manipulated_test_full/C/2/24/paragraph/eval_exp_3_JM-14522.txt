1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long with 7 chapters, making it challenging to maintain a cohesive narrative flow throughout.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous, horror, and romantic elements can disrupt the reader's immersion.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with descriptive details, potentially overwhelming the reader and obscuring key plot points.
- [LOGIC] The integration of modern technological references (e.g., "deepfake filter", "voice command triggered automation", "wireless charger", "AI core", "biosensor", "self-driving cart") feels anachronistic and jarring in a predominantly late 19th-century setting.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
