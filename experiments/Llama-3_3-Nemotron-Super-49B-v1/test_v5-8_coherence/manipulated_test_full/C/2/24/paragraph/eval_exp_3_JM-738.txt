1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly complex and convoluted narrative structure, making it difficult to follow the plot progression.
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative theories and hypotheses within the text, confusing the presentation of the actual story.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different sections (e.g., from "THE STORY" to "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY") without smooth transitions.
- [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the logical flow of deductions and theories presented by the author.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "thou", "thee") that may hinder modern readers' understanding.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
