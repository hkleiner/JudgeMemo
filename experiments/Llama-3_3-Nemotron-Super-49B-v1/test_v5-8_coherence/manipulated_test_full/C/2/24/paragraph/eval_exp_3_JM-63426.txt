1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly fragmented, with numerous chapters and abrupt transitions between different periods of the subject's life, making it challenging to follow a linear narrative.
- [CLARITY] Overuse of specific, unreferenced names (e.g., Mr. Moses, Mr. Newett) without immediate context can confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject's full biography.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, with some feeling like standalone vignettes rather than integrated parts of a cohesive autobiography.
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms and industry jargon (e.g., "Gordon press", "Caslon Black") may hinder understanding for readers without a printing or design background.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
