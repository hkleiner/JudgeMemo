1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing the Real Presence to Adoration without a linking paragraph).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and lengthy sentences that may hinder comprehension for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear headings or subheadings within chapters to guide the reader through the argument's progression.
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the historical context of the Church of England and its reforms without sufficient background provision.
- [RELEVANCE] Irrelevant, modern, technological metaphors (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched," "A drone swarm aligned in formation") that disrupt the historical and theological context.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
