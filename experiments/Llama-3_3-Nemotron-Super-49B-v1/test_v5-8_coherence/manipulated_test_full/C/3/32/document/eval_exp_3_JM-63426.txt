1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly fragmented, with multiple chapters and topics that don't flow smoothly into one another, making it hard to follow a central narrative or argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different periods of the subject's life and various projects without clear transitional phrases or sentences.
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague references ("a thing", "stuff") which obscures specific details and causes confusion.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of an "AFTERWORD" and "AN AFTERWORD" seems redundant and disrupts the coherence of the text's conclusion.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms ("telegraphed", "horse-car", etc.) may hinder understanding for some readers without historical context.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
