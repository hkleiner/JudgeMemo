1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long with 7 chapters, making it hard to maintain a cohesive narrative flow throughout.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters without clear transitional links, disrupting the smooth progression of the story.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly descriptive, potentially confusing the main plot with excessive, albeit vivid, detail (e.g., the ghost's various costumes and performances).
- [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., being hit by a pillow, using a dagger) contradicts typical ghostly traits, causing logical inconsistencies.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "thou", "thee", outdated expressions) may hinder modern readers' understanding and flow.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
