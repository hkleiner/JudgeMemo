1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents and lack of clear sectioning
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages, biblical references, and defensive arguments
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose and repetitive descriptions hindering ease of understanding
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., Garden of Eden location) and unproven assumptions
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "thing" used as a placeholder)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
