1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics.
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and sentence structures that may hinder understanding for modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Real Presence to Adoration and Sacrifice without a clear connecting summary.
- [REPETITION] Redundant explanations of the distinction between the Church of England's teachings and those of Rome/Catholicism.
- [FOCUS] Occasionally, the author's emotional appeals and personal addresses (e.g., "I pity laymen...") slightly detract from the academic coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
