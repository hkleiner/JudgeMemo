1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "THE STORY" chapter without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" may confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analyzing Dickens's work to introducing the story's characters without a smooth bridge.
- [LOGIC] Assumption about the reader's prior knowledge of Dickens's life and works (e.g., _Bleak House_, _The Signalman_) without brief context.
- [CLARITY] Dense, lengthy paragraphs in the introduction may overwhelm readers, hindering overall flow.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
