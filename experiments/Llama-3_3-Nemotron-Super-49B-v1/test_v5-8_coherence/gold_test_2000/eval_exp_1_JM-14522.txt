1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of family members).
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing everyday topics at supper to the supernatural event lacks a smooth transition.
- [LOGIC] The character's nonchalant response to seeing a ghost (Mr. Otis offering lubricant) might seem implausible to some readers, disrupting the narrative's logical flow.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
