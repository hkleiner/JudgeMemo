1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's documents to introducing the three principal points at issue (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) without a clear transitional sentence.
- [CLARITY] The lengthy paragraphs may hinder readability and make it difficult for some readers to follow the author's train of thought.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Introduction to Chapter I could be smoother, with a more explicit connection between the stated objective and the commencement of the examination of "The Real Presence."
- [LOGIC] The assumption that examining the Church of England's documents will yield a clear, unified teaching on the Doctrine of the Real Presence might be overly optimistic given the acknowledged diversity of interpretations within the Church.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
