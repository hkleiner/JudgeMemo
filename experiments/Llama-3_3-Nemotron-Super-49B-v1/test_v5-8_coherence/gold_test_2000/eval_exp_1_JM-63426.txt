1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION and CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of childhood activities).
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", transitions between different time periods or locations could be smoother.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of specific, detailed anecdotes (e.g., the faker selling soap) feels somewhat disconnected from the broader narrative of Will Bradley's impact or biography without clear explanatory links.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
