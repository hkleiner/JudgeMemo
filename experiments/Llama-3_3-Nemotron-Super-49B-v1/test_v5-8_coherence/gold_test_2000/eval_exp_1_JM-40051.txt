1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery story
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language sometimes obscures the main point (e.g., lengthy descriptions of scenery)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., from discussing the garden's location to describing its beauty)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's characteristics and their direct application to the described location without clear, logical justification
- [RELEVANCE] Inclusion of seemingly unrelated details (e.g., the story of Mr. Dovile and rattlesnakes) that, while illustrative, slightly detract from the coherence of the argument

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
