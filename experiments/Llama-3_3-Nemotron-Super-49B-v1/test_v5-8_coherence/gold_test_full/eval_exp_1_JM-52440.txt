1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing the Catechism to the Communion Service).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and sentence structures that may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between the analysis of different Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) and how they collectively support the main argument.
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the reader is deeply familiar with the historical context of the Reformation and the Church of England's documents without sufficient background provision.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
