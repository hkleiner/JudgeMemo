Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context or lookup for full understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analytical discussion to "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" without a clear transitional phrase/link.
