Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Sudden, unrelated sentences ("The voice recognition module powered up." and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb.") disrupt the text's flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("whomsoever", "thou") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Long, dense paragraphs without clear section breaks (beyond chapter headings) impair readability.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
