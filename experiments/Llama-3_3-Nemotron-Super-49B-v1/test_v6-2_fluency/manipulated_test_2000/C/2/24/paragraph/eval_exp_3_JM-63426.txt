Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences that slightly impede flow (e.g., first paragraph of "AN INTRODUCTION")
- [LEXICON] Infrequent use of less common vocabulary might slow some readers (e.g., "emancipation", "avant garde", "exquisite backwater")
- [TRANSITION] Slight disconnect between the end of "AN INTRODUCTION" and the start of "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clearer thematic bridge

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
