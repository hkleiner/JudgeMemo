Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between chapters and topics (e.g., sudden shift from describing the Otis family to discussing Christmas sentiments without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal and archaic language in some dialogue (e.g., "I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase") may hinder modern readability
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "was frightened" to "have been frightened" for consistency in past perfect tense usage)
- [STRUCTURE] Unnecessary inclusion of unrelated narrative segments (e.g., the detailed description of Stransom's encounter, which seems disconnected from the main plot)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
