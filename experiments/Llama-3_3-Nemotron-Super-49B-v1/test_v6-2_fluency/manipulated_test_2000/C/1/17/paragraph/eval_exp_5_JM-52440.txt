Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Abrupt transitions between different narrative styles (e.g., from religious discussion to ghost story to personal reflection) without clear connections.
  - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "sifting time", "sacramental appointment") that may hinder readability for non-specialist readers.
  - [GRAMMAR] Occasional lack of clarity in long, compound sentences (e.g., in the Church of England discussion) requiring re-reading.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
