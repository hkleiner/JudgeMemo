Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between topics (e.g., shift from discussing Bradley's work to a narrative about Stransom and then to Bradley's biography without clear connectors)
  - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "perennial springtime freshness", "non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design")
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter may confuse readers due to lack of clear chronological markers or transitions
  - [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or extra commas in long sentences)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
