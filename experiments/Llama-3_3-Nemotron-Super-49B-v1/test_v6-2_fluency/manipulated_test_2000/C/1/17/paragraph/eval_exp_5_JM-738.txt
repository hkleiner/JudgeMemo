Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion...") 
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "munificent", "saucey") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analytical introduction to narrative without clear transitional phrase (between preface and "CHAPTER: THE STORY")
  - [REPEAT] Repetitive emphasis on Jasper's character traits without immediate narrative progression

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
