Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It is your first day...") may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime") might require additional context for all readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense (e.g., "You are standing... You like her. You are now quite grown up...") in a few narrative transitions.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
