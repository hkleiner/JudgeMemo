Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple places (e.g., "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases for emphasis without variation (e.g., repeated "that" clauses)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or misplaced commas for clarity in long sentences)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
