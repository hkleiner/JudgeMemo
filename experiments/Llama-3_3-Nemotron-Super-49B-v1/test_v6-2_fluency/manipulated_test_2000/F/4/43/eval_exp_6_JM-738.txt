Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional effort for modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analytical discussion and narrative summary (e.g., transitioning from Dickens's health to character analysis) can disrupt flow.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
