Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "It shoulded be talked", "was know", "donâ€™t worked", "was on the Narrow Gauge", "you was hungry", "you are went", "you was to get", "you are sorry", "you went out", "you and your devil forage", "you are not that important", "you are spoken of as foreman")
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative reason)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'...")
- [LEXICON] Informal tone in some descriptions (e.g., "a dear!", "lusty, democratic ambition", "thick him to spoke") may disrupt formal fluency expectation
- [SPELLING] "emancipation" (correct, but in context, could imply a slightly different nuance than intended), "pi" (likely should be "type"), "Ingersoll dollar watch" (contextually unclear without explanation), "kneel down and ask God to tell your uncle" (could be "to ask your uncle")

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
