Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues:**
  - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "verily") may hinder modern readers' understanding.
  - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences can disrupt flow (e.g., the opening paragraph of "CHAPTER: AN INTEODUCTION").
  - [SPELLING] Typos and inconsistent spellings (e.g., "INTEODUCTION", "ghe", "tov", "experkence") detract from polish.
  - [GRAMMAR] Occasional subject-verb agreement issues and missing articles (e.g., "a few months later when you have just turned into your eighteenth year").
  - [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent formatting in chapter titles and occasional lack of clear transitions between paragraphs.

2) **FINAL Fluency Score:** **3.5**
