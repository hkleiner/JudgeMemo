  - [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "biught", "sne", "vlas", "difriculty", "enemys", "thse", "teh", "charecter", "recumbent posture" is correct but "recumbant" is also seen, "thier" etc.)
  - [GRAMMAR] Occasional grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., tense shifts, "was" instead of "were" in a few places)
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "gipsies", "thou", "thee" in quoted text, though fitting for the narrative's style)
  - [SYNTAX] A few long, complex sentences that slightly impede flow
