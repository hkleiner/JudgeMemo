1) **Fluency Issues:**
  - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "whipper-snapper", "gaiety", "vernal") may confuse modern readers.
  - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter: THE GAY NINETIES opening) can hinder flow.
  - [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., switching between past and present in anecdotes).
  - [STYLE] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed fashion descriptions in THE GAY NINETIES) may slow reading.
  - [COHERENCE] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt (e.g., from INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK to NEW FIELDS).

2) **FINAL Fluency Score:** **3.5**
