Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "thou", "thee", "verily")
- [FLOW] Abrupt transitions between theological discussion and unrelated narrative inserts (e.g., descriptions of Millet's "The Sower", George Stransom's story)
- [REPEAT] Repetitive emphasis on the same doctrinal points without significant progression in some sections
