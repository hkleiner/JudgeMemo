Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
  - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "whip-crack", "Vandyke", "waistcoat") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
  - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences in some chapters (e.g., "THE GAY NINETIES") can disrupt flow.
  - [GRAMMAR] Rare instances of tense inconsistency (e.g., switching between past and present in narrative sections).
  - [STYLE] Informal, reflective tone in later chapters ("TODAY IN 1954") contrasts sharply with earlier, more formal biographical sections.

2) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
