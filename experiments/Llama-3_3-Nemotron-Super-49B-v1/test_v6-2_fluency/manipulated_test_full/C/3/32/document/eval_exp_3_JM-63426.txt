Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues:**
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing", "stuff") for specific names/places, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Frequent, abrupt shifts between narrative styles (1st person, 2nd person) within the text.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional lack of clarity in sentence structure, potentially due to the amalgamation of texts from different times.
- [FLUENCY] Repetitive information across different chapters (e.g., Strathmore sample book, Caslon type enthusiasm).
- [CONTEXTUAL] Assuming prior knowledge of historical figures/events without introduction, potentially alienating some readers.

2) **FINAL Fluency Score:** **3.5**
