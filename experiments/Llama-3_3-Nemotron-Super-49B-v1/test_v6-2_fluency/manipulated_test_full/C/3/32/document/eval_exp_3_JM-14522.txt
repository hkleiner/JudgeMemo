Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder understanding for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst", though mostly avoided, some less common terms are present).
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
  - [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "the stuff" appears to be a placeholder or error, disrupting fluency).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
