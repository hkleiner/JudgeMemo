Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "gibber", "rascal", "genteel").
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may disrupt flow (e.g., Chapter I's opening dialogue).
  - [GRAMMAR] Mostly correct, with minor, negligible errors (e.g., "it's" instead of "its" in rare instances, not explicitly found but potentially present given the text's length).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
