Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences that slightly impede immediate clarity (e.g., the paragraph starting "In America, these goings-on...").
  - [LEXICON] A few potentially archaic terms or references (e.g., "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime") that might require additional context for modern readers.
  - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a couple of places (e.g., switching between past and past perfect in "The Peninsula Record...").

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
