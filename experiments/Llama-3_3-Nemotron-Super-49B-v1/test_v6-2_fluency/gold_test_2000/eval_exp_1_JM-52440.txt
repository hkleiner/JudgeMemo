Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic language (e.g., "whosoever", "thou" implied in "thee" references, though not directly used here) and theological jargon may reduce accessibility for non-specialist readers.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
