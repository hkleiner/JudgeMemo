**Brief Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England," demonstrates **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and exhibit a formal, scholarly tone appropriate for theological discourse. The language is rich and precise, though occasionally dense due to the subject's complexity and the era's writing style (suggesting an older text).

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, progressing logically from introducing the controversy to dissecting key points (Real Presence, etc.). The author clearly states their objective and method (examining the Church of England's documents). However, the depth of theological discussion and the assumption of prior knowledge on the subject might make the text challenging for non-specialist readers to follow without effort. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but the text's overall coherence is slightly compromised by its dense, intricate argumentation and lack of summaries or transitional phrases to aid less knowledgeable readers.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
