**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text exhibits strong fluency, with well-crafted, grammatically correct sentences that flow smoothly. The author's use of varied sentence structures (simple, compound, complex) enhances readability. Descriptive passages are vivid and engaging, showcasing a clear writing style. However, some sentences are lengthy and could benefit from slight adjustments for improved clarity.

**Coherence**: The narrative is highly coherent, with a clear chronological structure tracing Will Bradley's early life and career. Transitions between chapters ("AN INTRODUCTION" to "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING") are logical, and each section builds upon the previous one to form a cohesive biography. The introduction effectively sets the stage for the detailed, anecdotal chapter that follows, maintaining the reader's interest.

**Minor Observations**:
- A few very long sentences might confuse some readers.
- No significant coherence issues were found, but the shift in tone from biographical analysis (Chapter 1) to autobiographical narrative (Chapter 2) could be slightly more seamless with a transitional phrase.
