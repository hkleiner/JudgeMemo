**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an autobiographical account of Will Bradley's life and career, exhibits **high coherence**. The narrative is well-structured, progressing chronologically through Bradley's life, with each chapter focusing on a distinct period or aspect of his career. Transitions between chapters are logical, maintaining a clear flow of ideas. The author's reflective tone and occasional anecdotes enhance the narrative's engagement and thematic coherence.

Regarding **fluency**, the text is generally well-written, with most sentences being grammatically correct and easy to follow. However, the fluency is occasionally disrupted by:
- **Archaisms and outdated expressions** (e.g., "the stuff," "a thing") that might confuse modern readers unfamiliar with the context or requiring inference.
- **Repetitive mentions** of specific typefaces (e.g., Caslon) and design elements, which, while relevant, could be streamlined for smoother reading.
- **Sudden shifts in narrative voice** (first-person to second-person in some sections), though this is a stylistic choice due to the text's compilation from different memoirs.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
