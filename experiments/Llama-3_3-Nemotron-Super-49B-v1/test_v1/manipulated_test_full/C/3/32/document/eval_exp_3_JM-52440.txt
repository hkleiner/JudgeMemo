**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text exhibits **high fluency** with well-structured, grammatically correct sentences, facilitating easy comprehension despite its antiquated vocabulary and complex theological themes. The author's writing style is formal, consistent, and clear, with effective use of transitional phrases connecting ideas across paragraphs and chapters.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is strongly structured around a clear objective: to ascertain the Church of England's teaching on the Real Presence through its official documents. The narrative logically progresses through examining each document (Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, Homilies), maintaining a consistent argument against the Real Presence doctrine. However, the text's coherence is slightly diminished by its lengthy paragraphs, dense theological content, and occasional defensive tone, which might hinder flow for some readers.
