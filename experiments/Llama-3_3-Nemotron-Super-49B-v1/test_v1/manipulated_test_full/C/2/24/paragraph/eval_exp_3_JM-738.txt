**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an analytical piece on Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", exhibits **high fluency** with well-constructed, grammatically correct sentences, though occasionally dense with complex vocabulary and lengthy paragraphs. The author's voice is clear, and the text flows smoothly despite its academic and speculative nature.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-structured, logically progressing through introducing the mystery, presenting theories, and analyzing evidence. However, the depth of speculation and the multitude of theories (e.g., Mr. Proctor's, Mr. Cuming Walters's) might confuse readers not familiar with the original work, slightly impacting overall coherence due to the intricate web of interpretations.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
