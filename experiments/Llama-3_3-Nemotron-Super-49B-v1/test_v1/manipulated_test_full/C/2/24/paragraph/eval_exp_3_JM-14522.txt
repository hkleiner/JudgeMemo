**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, showcasing Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm. The narrative flows smoothly, with each sentence contributing to the overall rhythm.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is **well-structured** and easy to follow, despite its length and the inclusion of multiple chapters within the excerpt. The story unfolds logically, with each chapter building upon the previous one to maintain a coherent narrative arc. However, the abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from Chapter III to IV without clear time indicators) and the introduction of various subplots (e.g., the young Duke's pursuit of Virginia) might slightly detract from the coherence for readers not familiar with the full context of the novel.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
