**Brief Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, while ambitious in its claim to identify the Garden of Eden, exhibits **mixed fluency**. Sentences are often long and convoluted, hindering immediate clarity. However, the language is predominantly grammatically correct, with a somewhat archaic, formal tone that suits the subject's biblical and historical nature. 

**Coherence** is a significant challenge. The narrative jumps between biblical interpretation, geographical description, personal anecdote, and defensive argumentation against potential critics, lacking a clear, guiding structure. Despite this, the author's enthusiasm and central thesis remain consistent throughout, providing a unifying, albeit strained, thread.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 3  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
