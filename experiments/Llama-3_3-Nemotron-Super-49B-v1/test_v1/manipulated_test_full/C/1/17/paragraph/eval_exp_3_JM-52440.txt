**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, exhibits **high coherence**. It is meticulously structured, with a clear introduction, chapter divisions by topic (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), and a logical progression of arguments. Each section builds upon the previous, maintaining a focused exploration of the subject through various Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies). The author effectively uses transitional phrases and references to guide the reader through the complex theological discussion.

Regarding **fluency**, the text is well-written with grammatically correct sentences. However, the **fluency score is slightly lower** due to several factors:
- **Complexity and Length of Sentences**: Many sentences are lengthy and densely packed with theological jargon, which can hinder smooth reading for non-specialists.
- **Abrupt Transitions to Unrelated Examples**: Brief, unannounced shifts to unrelated topics (e.g., descriptions of artworks, literary characters) disrupt the otherwise consistent theological discourse, though these appear to be errors in the text provision (e.g., "The old woman smiled..." seems out of context).
- **Repetitiveness in Emphasizing the Same Point**: While effective for emphasis, the repeated clarification of the Church of England's stance against certain doctrines slightly detracts from the text's overall fluidity.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
