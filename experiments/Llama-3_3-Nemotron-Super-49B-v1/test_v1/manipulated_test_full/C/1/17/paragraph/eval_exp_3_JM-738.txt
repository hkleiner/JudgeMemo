**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an analytical exploration of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", exhibits **high fluency** with well-constructed, grammatically correct sentences, though occasionally marred by lengthy, complex constructions that may impede immediate comprehension. The language is rich and varied, suitable for an academic or literary analysis audience.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-structured, logically progressing through theories and evidence. However, the dense accumulation of speculative theories, character analyses, and external evidence (e.g., Forster's insights, Collins's drawings) can make the narrative somewhat **overly intricate** for effortless follow-through. Transitions between some sections feel slightly abrupt, and the sheer volume of speculative elements slightly detracts from a fully streamlined coherence.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
