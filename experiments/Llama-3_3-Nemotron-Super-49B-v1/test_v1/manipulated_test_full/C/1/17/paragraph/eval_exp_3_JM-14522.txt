**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **excellent fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and vary in length, contributing to a smooth reading experience. Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm are conveyed through polished, nuanced language, making each sentence a pleasure to read. The writing is rich, with vivid descriptions and dialogue that sounds natural, despite the period's formal tone.

**Coherence**: The narrative is **highly coherent**, with a clear, progressing storyline. Each chapter builds upon the last, maintaining a logical flow from the introduction of the ghost to the resolution. Character interactions and the ghost's antics are well-integrated, serving the plot's progression. However, the inclusion of seemingly unrelated passages (e.g., discussions on animal adaptation, Filipino daily routines) disrupts the coherence, feeling like insertions from different texts.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
