**Brief Explanation of Quality**

The text, an analytical essay on Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", exhibits **high fluency** with well-structured, grammatically correct sentences, though occasionally dense with complex vocabulary and lengthy paragraphs. The author's voice is clear, and the use of quotes and references enhances credibility. 

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, logically progressing through theories and evidence. However, the depth of analysis and the multitude of theories (e.g., Mr. Proctor's, Mr. Cuming Walters's) might overwhelm some readers, slightly impacting overall coherence due to complexity rather than structure.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
