**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, showcasing Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm. The narrative flows smoothly, with each sentence contributing to the overall rhythm.

Regarding **coherence**, the story is well-organized, with a clear narrative arc. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, maintaining a logical sequence of events. However, the text's coherence is slightly diminished by its episodic nature (e.g., each chapter feels somewhat self-contained) and the introduction of various, somewhat tangential, character backstories and philosophical musings, which, while enriching, occasionally disrupt the immediate narrative flow.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
