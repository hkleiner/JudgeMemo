**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," exhibits a unique blend of historical, biblical, and geographical discourse. 

- **Fluency**: The text's fluency is somewhat compromised by its archaic language, frequent long sentences, and occasional grammatical irregularities (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent verb tenses). However, the author's passion and detailed descriptions of the landscape somewhat mitigate these issues, maintaining a certain flow despite the challenges.
  
- **Coherence**: Coherence is the text's stronger aspect. The author presents a clear, albeit unconventional, thesis and supports it with a structured approach, weaving together biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes. The narrative stays focused on proving the location of the Garden of Eden, with each section building upon the last to create a cohesive, if not entirely convincing, argument.
