**Brief Explanation of Text Quality**

The text, an analytical essay on Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", exhibits **high fluency** with well-constructed, grammatically correct sentences, though occasionally dense with complex vocabulary and lengthy paragraphs. The author's voice is clear, and the text flows smoothly despite its academic tone.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-structured, logically progressing through introducing the mystery, presenting theories, and concluding with the author's interpretation. However, the depth of analysis and the multitude of theories discussed might make the narrative somewhat challenging to follow for readers unfamiliar with the original story or literary analysis techniques.
