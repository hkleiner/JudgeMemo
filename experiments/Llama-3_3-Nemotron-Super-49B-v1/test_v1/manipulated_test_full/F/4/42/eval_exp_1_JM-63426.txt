**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an autobiographical account of Will Bradley's life and career, exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are generally well-structured, grammatically correct, and flow smoothly, making the narrative easy to follow. The use of descriptive language and vivid imagery (e.g., descriptions of Victorian attire, Chicago's landscape) enhances readability. However, some sentences are lengthy and complex, which might slightly impede the flow for casual readers.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, with each chapter logically progressing through Bradley's life stages and career milestones. The narrative thread is clear, and the author's reflections and anecdotes effectively support the overall biographical structure. However, the inclusion of detailed lists (e.g., the chronology, award descriptions) and some repetitive information (across different memoir sources) slightly disrupts the otherwise cohesive narrative flow.
