**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," exhibits **mixed fluency**. While many sentences are well-structured and grammatically correct, contributing to a clear flow, others are overly long, convoluted, or contain awkward phrasing (e.g., "not too far not, north far too south"), hindering smooth reading. The writing style is often verbose, with repetitive expressions ("Come and see!" used multiple times) that, although engaging in intent, disrupt the narrative's polish.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is generally well-structured, progressing logically from introducing a discovery to detailing its location and characteristics. However, the narrative frequently diverges into tangential topics (e.g., discussions on cyclones, personal anecdotes, and geological age speculations) without clear transitions, slightly disrupting the overall cohesion. The author's enthusiasm and conviction are palpable, enhancing the text's engaging aspect but sometimes at the expense of a tightly focused argument.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 3
