**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an autobiographical account of Will Bradley's life and career, exhibits **high coherence**. The narrative is well-structured, progressing chronologically through Bradley's life, with each chapter focusing on a distinct period or aspect of his career. Transitions between chapters are logical, maintaining a clear flow of information. The author's use of reflective commentary and contextual details (e.g., historical references) enhances the narrative's depth and coherence.

Regarding **fluency**, the text is generally well-written, with most sentences being grammatically correct and easy to follow. However, there are occasional instances of:
- **Complex sentence structures** that may require re-reading for full comprehension.
- **Informal tone and colloquial expressions** (e.g., "God love them"), which, while engaging, might slightly detract from formal fluency expectations.
- **Minor repetitions and slight shifts in narrative voice** (first-person to second-person in some sections), which were retained for authenticity but might affect smooth reading in a formal context.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
