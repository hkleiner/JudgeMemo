**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text exhibits **high fluency** with well-structured, grammatically correct sentences, facilitating smooth reading. The author's command of complex sentence structures, nuanced vocabulary, and consistent tone enhances the overall readability. However, the dense, lengthy paragraphs and occasional overly complex sentences may hinder comprehension for some readers.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, logically progressing through the introduction, chapters (I-III), and conclusion, with each section clearly addressing a specific aspect of the doctrine. The author effectively connects ideas, uses transitional phrases, and references relevant documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.) to support arguments. The sole drawback is the text's assumption of prior knowledge on the subject matter, which might confuse unfamiliar readers.
