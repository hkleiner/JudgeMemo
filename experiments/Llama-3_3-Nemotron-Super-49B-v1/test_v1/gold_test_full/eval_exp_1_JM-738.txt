**Brief Explanation of Text Quality**

The text, an analytical essay on Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", exhibits **high fluency** with well-constructed, grammatically correct sentences, though occasionally dense with complex vocabulary and lengthy paragraphs. The author's voice is clear, and the text flows smoothly despite its academic tone.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-structured, logically progressing through theories and analyses of the mystery. However, the depth of detail and the multitude of theories presented (e.g., Mr. Proctor's, Mr. Cuming Walters's) might overwhelm some readers, slightly impacting overall coherence for those unfamiliar with the original story or its scholarly discussions.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
