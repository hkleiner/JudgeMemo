**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, while ambitious in its claim to identify the Garden of Eden, exhibits **mixed fluency**. Sentences are often long and convoluted, hindering immediate clarity. However, the language is predominantly correct grammatically, with only occasional minor errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg"). The **coherence** is challenged by the text's meandering structure, lack of clear transitions between ideas, and the blending of biblical interpretation, geographical description, and personal anecdote without a strong narrative or logical thread. Despite this, the author's enthusiasm and the central claim provide a unifying, albeit tenuous, coherence.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 3  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
