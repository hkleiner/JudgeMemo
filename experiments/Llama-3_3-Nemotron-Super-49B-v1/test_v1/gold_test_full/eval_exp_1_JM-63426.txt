**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an autobiographical account of Will Bradley's life and career, exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are generally well-structured, grammatically correct, and flow smoothly, making the narrative easy to follow. The use of vivid descriptive language, especially in depicting historical settings and personal anecdotes, enhances readability. However, some sentences are lengthy and complex, which might slightly impede the flow for casual readers.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, with each chapter logically progressing through Bradley's life stages and career milestones. The narrative thread is clear, and the author's reflections and anecdotes support the overall biographical theme. Yet, the transition between some chapters feels somewhat abrupt, and the inclusion of detailed lists (e.g., the chronology) disrupts the otherwise cohesive narrative flow slightly.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4
