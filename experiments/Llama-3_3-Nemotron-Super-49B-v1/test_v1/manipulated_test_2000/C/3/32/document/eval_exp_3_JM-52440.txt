**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England," demonstrates **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and exhibit a formal, scholarly tone appropriate for theological discourse. The language is rich and precise, though occasionally dense due to the subject's complexity and the era's writing style (suggestive of 19th-century literature).

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, progressing logically from introducing a topic to delving into its specifics. The author clearly states the objective, outlines the approach (examining specific Church of England documents), and systematically analyzes the first set of these documents (The Articles). However, the coherence is slightly compromised by the depth of theological detail, which might make the text challenging for non-specialist readers to follow without prior knowledge of the doctrines in question. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, maintaining a coherent flow.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
