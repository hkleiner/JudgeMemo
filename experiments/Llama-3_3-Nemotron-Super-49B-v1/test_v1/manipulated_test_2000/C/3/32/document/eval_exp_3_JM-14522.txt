**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, showcasing Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm. The narrative flows smoothly, with each sentence contributing to the overall rhythm.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is **well-structured** and easy to follow. The story transitions logically from the introduction of the haunted house to the Otis family's experiences. Character introductions are concise and relevant, and the plot unfolds in a coherent, engaging manner. However, the abrupt shift in tone and the introduction of new, unexplained elements (e.g., the twins' nickname "The Star and Stripes" without clear context) slightly detract from perfect coherence.
