**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text exhibits strong fluency, with well-crafted, grammatically correct sentences. The language is rich and varied, contributing to an engaging narrative flow. However, some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which may slightly impede readability. Additionally, the frequent use of "a thing" (e.g., "a thing, Massachusetts") is jarring and seems to be a placeholder or error, disrupting the otherwise polished writing.

**Coherence**: The text is highly coherent, with a clear narrative structure across both chapters. The introduction effectively sets the stage for Will Bradley's impact, while "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" provides a compelling, detailed backstory. Transitions between scenes are generally smooth, though the shift in focus within "The Boy Printer" could be more seamless at times. The overall narrative arc is easy to follow, and the text effectively builds a cohesive portrait of the subject.
