**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text exhibits strong fluency, with well-crafted, grammatically correct sentences. The language is rich and descriptive, effectively painting vivid images of the protagonist's life. However, the narrative occasionally suffers from overly long, complex sentences that may slightly impede smooth reading. Additionally, some transitions between paragraphs could be more seamless.

**Coherence**: The text is highly coherent, with a clear, chronological structure tracing Will Bradley's early life and career. Each chapter focuses on a distinct period, contributing to an overarching narrative. The introduction sets a thoughtful context for Bradley's impact, while "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" provides a engaging, detailed backstory. The only minor detractor is the abrupt ending of the second chapter without a clear connection back to the introductory themes, aside from the implicit development of Bradley's character.
