**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an analytical introduction and chapter to "The Puzzle of Dickens's Last Plot" by Andrew Lang, exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, indicating a sophisticated writing style. The author's command of language is evident, making the text flow smoothly despite its complexity and the dense literary and historical references.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, with a clear structure (Introduction, Dramatis Person√¶, Opening of the Tale, etc.). However, the coherence score is slightly lower than fluency due to the text's assumption of prior knowledge about Dickens, his works, and the literary context of the time. While the text logically builds upon itself, the lack of introductory context for these assumptions might confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter. Additionally, the abrupt ending ("An livestream began recording.") disrupts the coherence, suggesting an incomplete or improperly truncated text.
