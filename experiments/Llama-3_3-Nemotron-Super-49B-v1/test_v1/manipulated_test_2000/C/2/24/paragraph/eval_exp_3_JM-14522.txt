**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, showcasing Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm. The narrative flows smoothly, with each sentence contributing to the overall rhythm.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is **well-structured** and easy to follow. The story progresses logically from the introduction of the haunted house to the family's encounter with the ghost. However, the abrupt appearance of anachronistic elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather", "A bluetooth signal was detected", "A surveillance camera moved slightly") disrupts the otherwise consistent Victorian-era setting, slightly impacting coherence.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
