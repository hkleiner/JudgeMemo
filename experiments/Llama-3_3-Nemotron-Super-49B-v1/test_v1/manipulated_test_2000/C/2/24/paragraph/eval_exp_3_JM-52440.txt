**Brief Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England," demonstrates **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and exhibit a formal, scholarly tone appropriate for theological discourse. The language is rich and precise, though occasionally dense due to the subject's complexity and the era's writing style (suggestive of 19th-century literature).

Regarding **coherence**, the text is well-organized, with a clear introduction setting the stage for the inquiry, followed by a logical progression into the first chapter. The author effectively connects sentences to build a coherent argument, identifying the point of contention, outlining the approach, and beginning the examination of church documents. However, the abrupt appearances of unrelated phrases ("The voice recognition module powered up," "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb," "The biosensor updated its readout") disrupt the coherence, suggesting either errors in the provided text or intentional inclusions for a separate context not apparent here.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
*Rationale: Well-structured argument with a clear progression, marred by unrelated phrases.*

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5  
*Rationale: Excellent sentence structure, appropriate tone, and precise language throughout.*
