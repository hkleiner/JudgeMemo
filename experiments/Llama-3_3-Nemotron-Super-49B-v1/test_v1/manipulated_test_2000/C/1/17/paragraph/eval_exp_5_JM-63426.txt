**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, comprising two chapters of Will Bradley's biography, exhibits **strong coherence**. The narrative flows logically, with each chapter focusing on a distinct aspect of Bradley's life (introduction to his impact and his early life as a boy printer). Transitions between ideas are generally smooth, maintaining reader engagement. However, the abrupt shift in the second chapter from a descriptive biography to a detailed, almost diary-like account of Bradley's childhood, might slightly disrupt the overall narrative flow for some readers.

Regarding **fluency**, the text is well-written with grammatically correct sentences. The language is rich and descriptive, particularly in the second chapter, where vivid scenes of Bradley's childhood are painted. However, the density of descriptive details in some paragraphs might slow down the reading pace for some, and a few sentences are lengthy, which could slightly impact fluency for readers preferring shorter sentence structures.
