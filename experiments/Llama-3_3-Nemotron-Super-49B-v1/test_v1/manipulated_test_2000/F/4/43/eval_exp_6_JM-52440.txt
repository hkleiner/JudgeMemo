**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

The text, an excerpt from "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England," demonstrates **high coherence**. It is well-structured, starting with an introduction that clearly states the objective, followed by a logical progression into Chapter I, which focuses on a specific aspect of the doctrine (The Real Presence). The author systematically presents different viewpoints, identifies the point of contention, and outlines the methodology for resolving the question by examining the Church of England's authoritative documents. This structured approach ensures the text builds coherently towards its investigative goal.

Regarding **fluency**, the text scores well but with some deductions. Sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, indicating a high level of linguistic proficiency. However, the complexity and length of some sentences (often exceeding 30 words and incorporating multiple clauses) may impede effortless reading for non-specialist readers. Additionally, there are a few instances of slightly archaic language ("whosoever," "doth") and a small section with seemingly disjointed or repetitive phrases ("The thing soul hand with..."), which might be a transcription error or a momentary lapse in clarity.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
