**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, showcasing Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm. The language is formal, reflective of the late 19th-century period, yet remains engaging and easy to follow for modern readers. However, there's a noticeable disruption in fluency in the second chapter's opening sentence, which appears disjointed and possibly a formatting error ("CHAPTER: nothing / raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred."). This anomaly slightly mars the otherwise impeccable fluency.

**Coherence**: The narrative demonstrates **strong coherence**. The story unfolds logically, with each scene building upon the last to maintain reader interest and advance the plot. Character introductions are clear, and their interactions logically progress the ghostly theme. The transition from skepticism to the confrontation with the ghost is well-handled. The only slight coherence issue is the abrupt start of the second chapter, which, despite being possibly a formatting glitch, does not significantly hinder the overall narrative flow once the chapter properly begins.
