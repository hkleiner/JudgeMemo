**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text exhibits strong fluency, with well-crafted, grammatically correct sentences. The language is rich and descriptive, effectively painting vivid images of the era and Will Bradley's early life. However, there are occasional abrupt transitions between sentences or paragraphs, and some sentences are lengthy, which might slightly impede the flow for some readers.

**Coherence**: The text is highly coherent, with a clear narrative structure dividing the story into chapters that logically progress through Bradley's life. The introduction sets a compelling context for Bradley's impact, and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter engagingly narrates his formative years. Transitions between different life events are generally smooth, maintaining the reader's engagement. The only minor deduction is for the introduction's somewhat abrupt shift from discussing Bradley's broad impact to the personal, biographical focus of the second chapter, though this is a minor quibble given the chapter division.
