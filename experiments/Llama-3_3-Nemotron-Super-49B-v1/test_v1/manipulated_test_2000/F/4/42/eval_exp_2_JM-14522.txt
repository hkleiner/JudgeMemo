**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency:** The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency**. Sentences are well-structured, grammatically correct, and rich in vocabulary, showcasing Wilde's characteristic wit and sarcasm. However, some intentional archaic language and a few grammatically incorrect sentences (likely for comedic effect or to mimic period speech) slightly detract from perfect fluency.

**Coherence:** The narrative demonstrates **excellent coherence**. The story unfolds logically, with each chapter and scene building upon the last to maintain reader engagement. Character introductions are clear, and the transition from setup to the supernatural encounter is seamless. The thematic contrast between American pragmatism and British tradition is consistently woven throughout.
