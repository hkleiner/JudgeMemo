**Brief Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency:** The text exhibits mostly good fluency, with well-structured sentences that are generally grammatically correct. However, there are scattered instances of subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "those who was loyal", "the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt"), and some sentences are overly long, which can hinder readability. The archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "was" used incorrectly in places) and formal tone are consistent with the subject matter but may affect modern readers' ease of understanding.

**Coherence:** The text is highly coherent, with a clear introduction setting up the investigation's objective. The structure logically progresses from introducing the controversy to dissecting key points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), and then focusing on the first point. Transitions between paragraphs are smooth, maintaining a coherent flow. The author effectively uses references to religious texts and Church documents to build a structured argument, making the overall narrative easy to follow despite its complexity.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
