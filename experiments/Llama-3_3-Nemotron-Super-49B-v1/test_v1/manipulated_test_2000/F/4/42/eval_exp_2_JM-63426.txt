**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text exhibits mostly good fluency, with well-structured sentences that are generally grammatically correct. However, there are noticeable errors (e.g., "It shoulded be talked about", "was know", "don’t worked", "was found", "was on", "are went home", "was to get", "was to be", "was a man’s wages") that disrupt the otherwise smooth flow, indicating a need for proofreading. The narrative voice is engaging, and the use of descriptive language enhances the reading experience.

**Coherence**: The text is highly coherent, with a clear narrative structure dividing the introduction from the biographical chapter. Each chapter focuses on a distinct aspect of Will Bradley's life and impact, contributing to an overall cohesive portrait. Transitions between scenes in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" are effective, maintaining the reader's engagement. The only slight disconnect is the abrupt shift from discussing Bradley's broad impact to the detailed, personal anecdotes of his youth, though this does not significantly detract from the overall coherence.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
