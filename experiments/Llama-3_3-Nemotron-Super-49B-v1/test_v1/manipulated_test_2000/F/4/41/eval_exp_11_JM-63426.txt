**Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency**: The text exhibits strong fluency, with well-constructed, grammatically correct sentences. The language is rich and descriptive, effectively painting vivid images of the era and Will Bradley's early life. However, there are occasional typos (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "wre" instead of "were", "teh" instead of "the", etc.) and minor punctuation inconsistencies, which slightly detract from the overall fluency. The narrative voice is engaging, making the text enjoyable to read despite these minor flaws.

**Coherence**: The text is highly coherent, with a clear narrative structure dividing the story into chapters that logically progress through Bradley's life. Each chapter focuses on a distinct period, contributing to a cohesive biography. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, maintaining the reader's flow. The only slight disconnect is the abrupt shift from discussing Bradley's broad impact on American graphic arts in "An Introduction" to the deeply personal, detailed childhood account in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming", but this is a deliberate narrative choice rather than a coherence issue.
