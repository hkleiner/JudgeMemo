**Brief Quality Explanation (Fluency & Coherence)**

**Fluency:** The text exhibits strong fluency, characterized by well-structured, grammatically correct sentences. The language is formal and rich, with complex vocabulary suitable for a theological discussion. However, the density of the content and the occasional archaic terms (e.g., "thou", "doth") might impede immediate understanding for some readers. Minor typos (e.g., "unvommon", "srrvice", "tue") are present but do not significantly detract from the overall fluency.

**Coherence:** The text is highly coherent, with a clear introduction setting the stage for the exploration of the Doctrine of the Real Presence as taught by the Church of England. The structure is logical, progressing from a general introduction to a specific chapter focus (Chapter I: The Real Presence), and then to an examination of authoritative documents (Articles of the Church). Transitions between ideas are smooth, and the author's objective is consistently clear throughout.
