-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Jasper, Rosa, Mrs. Umney, George Stransom without connection to the main Eden narrative)
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose and dense paragraphs hindering easy comprehension
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between ideas and sections
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "antldiluvians", "thoroughly satisfied") may confuse modern readers
* [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking the Mississippi to the Euphrates without clear evidence)
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in punctuation and capitalization (e.g., "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT", inconsistent comma usage)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Is the text a compilation of different drafts or unrelated pieces, given the drastic narrative shifts?
- Were specific guidelines provided for the tone (e.g., archaic vs. modern) that might contextualize some of the lexical choices?
