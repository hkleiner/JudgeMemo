-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Will Bradley's work to a narrative about Stransom and Creston (mid-text)
* [CLARITY] Unclear connection between the two distinct narrative parts (Bradley's introduction and the Stransom/Creston scene)
* [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements between chapters and within the text to guide the reader smoothly
* [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "corn-fed") might hinder flow for some readers
* [LOGIC] The narrative about Stransom and Creston seems unrelated to Will Bradley's biography, causing coherence issues
* [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences in some areas (e.g., the description of the jeweller's window) may impede fluency

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
- Is the narrative about Stransom and Creston intended to be a fictional piece by Will Bradley or an unrelated anecdote by the author, and how does it relate to Bradley's work?
- Are the chapters provided sequential in the original "Chap Book," or is there missing context/linking material?
