-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated scene transitions (e.g., from theological discussion to ghost story to personal reflection without connection)
[LOGIC] Lack of narrative coherence across different story segments
[CLARITY] Unclear overall story purpose or theme due to disjointed narratives
[TRANSITION] No transitional elements between vastly different scenes
[LEXICON] Inconsistent tone (formal theological discourse, casual ghost story, introspective personal narrative)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
Are the provided texts intended to be separate stories or chapters of a single, experimental work? Clarification could significantly impact the coherence score.
