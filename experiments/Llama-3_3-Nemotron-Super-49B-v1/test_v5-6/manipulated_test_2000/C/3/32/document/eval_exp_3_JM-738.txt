-> 1) Issues: 
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures hinder immediate understanding.
* [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic terms (e.g., "a stuff", "thing") without clear context or consistent replacement for missing nouns, causing confusion.
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences, making the transition between ideas somewhat abrupt.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from analysis to the story's dramatis personae without a smooth transition.
* [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent character age and timeline references (e.g., John Jasper's age and its implications).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Are the archaic terms and missing nouns ("a stuff", "thing") intentional placeholders or errors?
2. Is there a complete version of the story intended, as the provided text ends abruptly in the middle of a scene?
