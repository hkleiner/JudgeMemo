-> 1) Issues: 
* [LEXICON] "a thing" used repeatedly without clear replacement (e.g., "a thing Street", "the thing by his parents", "the thing drawl")
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering immediate understanding
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing the family's conversation topics to the supernatural event without a smoother link
* [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent handling of character names (e.g., "the thing" for Washington Otis initially)
* [SPELLING] "guilty spirit still haunts the stuff" (likely a placeholder error)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Are "a thing" and "stuff" intentional placeholders or errors in the provided text?
2. Should the evaluation consider the text's apparent humorous and satirical intent in assessing coherence and fluency?
