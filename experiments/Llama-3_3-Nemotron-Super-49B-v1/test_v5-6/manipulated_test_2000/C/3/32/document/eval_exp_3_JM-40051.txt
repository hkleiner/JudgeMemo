-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, hindering easy comprehension.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou", "thee", "antldiluvians", "antideluvians") may confuse modern readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumes biblical accuracy without addressing potential counterarguments or alternative theories.
* [SYNTAX] Repetitive sentence structures and lack of varied phrasing.
* [SPELLING] Minor errors (e.g., "admirirg", "commistes", "jageed").
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from descriptive to speculative content without clear connectors.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
Are there any specific guidelines for handling archaic language in fluency scoring (e.g., should it be penalized for not being modern, or valued for stylistic choice)? 
Should the coherence score account for the author's apparent intent to persuade rather than purely inform?
