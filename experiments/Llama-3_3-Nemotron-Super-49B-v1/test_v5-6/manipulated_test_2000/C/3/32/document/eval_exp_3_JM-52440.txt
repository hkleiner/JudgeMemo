-> 1) Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures and verbose language may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the controversy to introducing the Church of England's documents without a clear connecting sentence.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "stuff" likely meaning "Church" or a similar institution, "thou", "thee") may confuse modern readers.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between explaining the controversy, the author's intent, and the Church's documents without a clear sectioning for each topic beyond chapter headings.
* [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of specific religious texts (e.g., 1 Cor. x. 16, 17) without brief context.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Is "stuff" a typo or an archaic term for an institution (likely "Church"), and would clarification enhance readability?
2. Are readers expected to have a baseline understanding of the referenced scriptures and the Reformation principles, or is this text intended for a specialized audience?
