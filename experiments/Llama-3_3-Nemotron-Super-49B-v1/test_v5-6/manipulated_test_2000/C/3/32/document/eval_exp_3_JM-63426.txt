-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear connection.
[CLARITY] Overuse of vague phrases ("a thing", "stuff") detracts from specificity.
[LEXICON] Repetitive use of simplistic phrases ("you are now...") in Chapter 2.
[SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences (e.g., in paragraphs describing Bradley's impact) hinder flow.
[LOGIC] Unresolved narrative thread regarding the faker scene at the end of Chapter 2.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
- Was the consistent use of "a thing" and "stuff" intentional for stylistic effect, or an oversight?
- Is the abrupt ending of Chapter 2 (with the faker) intended to be concluded in a subsequent chapter not provided?
