-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and story retelling
[CLARITY] Overly complex sentences with multiple nested clauses
[LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture") may hinder modern readability
[LOGIC] Assumptions about character intentions without clear textual evidence (e.g., Princess Puffer's motivations)
[SYNTAX] Inconsistent paragraph structure and length, disrupting flow
[TRANSITION] Sudden, unannounced shift from analysis to "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" without clear connection

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Is the target audience assumed to have prior knowledge of Dickens' works and 19th-century literary context, given the dense references?
2. Were the abrupt transitions and structure intended for a specific narrative effect, or are they considered flaws in this evaluation?
