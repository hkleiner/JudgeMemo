-> 1) Issues: 
* [ANACHRONISM] - A hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera are mentioned in a 19th-century setting.
* [LEXICON] - Some word choices (e.g., "spry young fellows", "enterprising impresarios") may be less common but are not incorrect; however, the overall vocabulary is rich and period-appropriate with minor exceptions.
* [STRUCTURE] - Abrupt transition from describing the family's evening conversation to the ghost's appearance at night (could be smoother).
* [CLARITY] - Minor ambiguity in the transition between the family's daily activities and the nighttime ghost encounter (e.g., the timing and setup for the ghost's appearance could be clearer).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the anachronistic elements (hologram, bluetooth, surveillance camera) intentional for a modern adaptation or considered errors in a traditional narrative context?
- Should the transition between daily activities and the ghost's nighttime appearance be considered a major structural flaw given the overall coherence of the story?
