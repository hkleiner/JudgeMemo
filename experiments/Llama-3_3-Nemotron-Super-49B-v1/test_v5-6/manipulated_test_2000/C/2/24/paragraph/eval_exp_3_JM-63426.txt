-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear connection
[CLARITY] Some sentences overly complex or wordy (e.g., descriptions of childhood events)
[LEXICON] Occasional archaic terms (e.g., "pi", "picklelime") without context for modern readers
[LOGIC] Unresolved narrative thread (e.g., the story of the faker and Mr. Newett's reaction is left hanging)
[SYNTAX] Infrequent but noticeable comma splices and run-on sentences
[TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs within chapters

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the chapters intended to be standalone or is the abrupt transition a stylistic choice?
- Would providing contextual footnotes for archaic terms enhance reader experience?
