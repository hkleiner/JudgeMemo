-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, hindering easy comprehension.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "antldiluvians", "antideluvians") may confuse modern readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly evidenced beyond personal impression.
* [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large").
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts without clear connectors (e.g., from description to "A mobile hotspot activated" and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life").
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "commisitutes", "dimentions", "Healdâ€™s" [inconsistency in possessive form if intentional, otherwise correct as is but noted for consistency]).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the sudden mentions of modern technology ("A mobile hotspot activated", "The voice-activated controls blinked to life") intentional for a specific narrative reason, or are they errors?
- Would providing clearer transitional phrases and reorganizing the narrative structure significantly improve coherence?
