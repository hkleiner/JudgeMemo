-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between philosophical/theological discussions and unrelated technological phrases (e.g., "The voice recognition module powered up", "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb", "The biosensor updated its readout")
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense theological jargon may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the introduction and the start of Chapter I
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou", "thee", etc. not present but "whomsoever" and overall formal tone) might reduce accessibility

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
Are the interspersed technological phrases (voice recognition, autonomous vehicle, biosensor) intentional for a specific narrative or thematic reason, or are they errors? If intentional, does the context provide sufficient explanation for their inclusion in a theological text?
