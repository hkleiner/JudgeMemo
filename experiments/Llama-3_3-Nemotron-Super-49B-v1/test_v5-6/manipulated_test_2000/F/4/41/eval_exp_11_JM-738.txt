-> 1) Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "deserfed", "ajd", "oeft", "apopldxy", "notvout", "disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasperâ€™s birth" - inconsistency in timeline calculation)
* [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences hindering flow (e.g., the entire first paragraph of the Introduction)
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may confuse modern readers (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin")
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between analysis and story retelling (e.g., jumping from Dickens's health to character analysis)
* [CLARITY] Overly dense, assumes extensive prior knowledge of Dickens's works and historical context
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters/sections (e.g., from "INTRODUCTION" to "THE STORY")

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Are the typos and spelling errors intentional (e.g., for historical authenticity) or oversights?
2. Is the target audience presumed to have a deep background in 19th-century literature and Dickens's complete works?
