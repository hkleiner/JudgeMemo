-> 1) Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "princopak", "cohsequently", "admirirg", "prlper", "inhabitant of all the earth" should be "inhabitants")
[SPELLING] Numerous spelling mistakes (e.g., "dkscovered", "antldiluvians", "princopak", "cohsequently", "admirirg", "prlper")
[SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some...")
[LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "veritable", "euphony", "antideluvians")
[LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly evidenced beyond the author's conviction
[STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between biblical interpretation, personal discovery, and geographical description
[CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages may obscure the central argument for some readers
[TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different topics (e.g., from scientific speculation to local snake population)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are there any specific guidelines on handling archaic language in fluency scoring?
- Should the coherence score account for the author's persuasive intent versus objective narrative coherence?
