-> 1) Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "vety", "guarfians", "waw", "xeven", "tuey", "reavhed", "Yhe", "evwrything", "librwry", "Myerw", "whxt", "obpong", "anmold")
* [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "which he never ceased to regret" feels slightly out of place)
* [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in transitions between some paragraphs (e.g., Chapter II's opening feels somewhat disconnected from the previous scene)
* [LEXICON] Overuse of similar descriptors for characters' appearances (e.g., "handsome", "good-looking", "lithe and lovely")

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
* Are the numerous spelling errors considered part of the evaluation, assuming this is a raw, unedited text? 
* Should the humorous, satirical tone (e.g., American Minister's reactions) influence the coherence score, as it might affect how "logical" the character interactions seem?
