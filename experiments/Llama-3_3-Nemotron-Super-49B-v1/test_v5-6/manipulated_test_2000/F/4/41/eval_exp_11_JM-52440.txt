-> 1) Issues: 
* [SPELLING] (multiple typos: "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "srrvice", "tue", "prssent", "wnd", "vby", "ln", "hexven", "kt", "generak", "momennt")
* [SYNTAX] (occasional awkward sentence structures, e.g., "Now kt would be strange indeed...")
* [CLARITY] (some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better understanding)
* [TRANSITION] (transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, especially between chapters and within dense theological explanations)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
Are there any specific guidelines on how to handle theological or domain-specific terminology in terms of fluency and coherence scoring (e.g., accepting complex sentences as necessary for the subject matter)?
