-> 1) Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "is" instead of "are")
[GRAMMAR] Incorrect tense consistency (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear reason)
[SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in several sentences (e.g., "when you was hungry", "you are now a worked man")
[LEXICON] Overuse of passive voice in some sections
[CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, hindering immediate understanding
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapters without a clear connector
[LOGIC] Minor inconsistencies in timeline presentation (e.g., exact years and ages not always clearly aligned)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are there any specific preferences for handling historical context explanations (e.g., the impact of Bradley's work) in terms of depth and integration into the narrative flow?
- Should the transition between chapters be more explicitly guided for better coherence, or is the current structure acceptable given the biographical nature of the text?
