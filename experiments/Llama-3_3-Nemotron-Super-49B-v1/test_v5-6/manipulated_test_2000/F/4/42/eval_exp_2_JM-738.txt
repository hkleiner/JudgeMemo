-> 1) Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb conjugation (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "was")
[SPELLING] "omniously" (should be "ominously"), "babblinged" (should be "babbling")
[SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences hindering clarity
[LEXICON] Archaic language may impede modern readers' understanding (e.g., "hab nab at a venture")
[LOGIC] Assumptions about character relationships and backstories without clear introduction
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and story narration
[CLARITY] Overly dense, packed paragraphs lacking clear topic separation
[TRANSITION] Poor flow from the Introduction to The Story chapter

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Is the target audience assumed to have prior knowledge of Dickens' works and 19th-century literary context, given the dense, specialized analysis?
2. Would reorganizing the text to separate historical/contextual analysis from the story summary improve coherence?
