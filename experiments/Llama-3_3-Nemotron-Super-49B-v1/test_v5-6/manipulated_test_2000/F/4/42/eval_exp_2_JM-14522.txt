-> 1) Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple verb tense inconsistencies (e.g., "had come", "was doing", "have telegraphed", "am usually called", "woulded did it", "have been", "am removed")
* [SPELLING] "woedn't" (should be "wouldn't"), "recuper" (implied, though not directly written, as "recover" is correctly used in context but "recuperate" might have been intended in some reader's interpretation, however, the actual text uses "recover" correctly)
* [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in a few sentences (e.g., "we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language")
* [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "punctilious", "receptive expectations", "phantasmata") might hinder flow for some readers
* [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Mr. Otis's skepticism towards ghosts without clear buildup
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to II without a clear narrative bridge
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, reducing clarity

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the numerous grammatical errors (tense inconsistencies, etc.) considered part of the character's voice or simply errors in the text?
- Should the overly formal vocabulary be considered a fluency issue for a general audience versus an academic or literary one?
