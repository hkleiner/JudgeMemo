-> 1) Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "those who was", "we was", "it woulded")
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "beared" instead of "bore", "was" instead of "were" in some contexts, "was" in "was the present question")
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures for modern readability (though mostly clear)
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering immediate understanding
* [STRUCTURE] While overall structured, transitions between paragraphs could be smoother for enhanced flow
* [LEXICON] Archaic language use (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "was" in place of "were" and other antiquated constructions) may affect readability for some readers

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the archaic language and grammatical errors considered part of the text's historical authenticity, potentially impacting the fluency score in the context of its original publication date?
- Should the evaluation of coherence consider the text's ability to convey a clear argument despite its structural and fluency issues?
