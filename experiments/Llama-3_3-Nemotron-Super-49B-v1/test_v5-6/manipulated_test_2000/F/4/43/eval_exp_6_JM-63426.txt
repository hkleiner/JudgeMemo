-> 1) Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] - Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing/extra commas)
[SYNTAX] - Occasionally awkward sentence structures for clarity
[CLARITY] - Some paragraphs overly dense with unrelated details
[TRANSITION] - Abrupt shift from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 without clear connector
[LEXICON] - Archaic terms (e.g., "corn-fed American") may confuse modern readers
[STRUCTURE] - Non-linear storytelling in Chapter 2 might confuse some readers

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the archaic terms and references intended for a specific audience familiar with the era, potentially justifying their use?
- Would adding transitional phrases between chapters enhance coherence without altering the narrative's integrity?
