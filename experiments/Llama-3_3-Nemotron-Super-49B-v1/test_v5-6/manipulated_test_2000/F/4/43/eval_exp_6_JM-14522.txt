-> 1) Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in a few places (e.g., "had felt" to "feel" without clear transition)
* [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (may hinder flow for non-native readers)
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" (lack of clear chapter title or indicator)
* [CLARITY] Some long, winding sentences reduce immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of family members)
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in tone from serious to comedic without clear narrative bridge

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
* Is the text an excerpt from a known work (seems stylistically akin to Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost")?
* Are there specific reader demographics (e.g., native English speakers, familiarity with late 19th-century literature) that the evaluation should consider?
