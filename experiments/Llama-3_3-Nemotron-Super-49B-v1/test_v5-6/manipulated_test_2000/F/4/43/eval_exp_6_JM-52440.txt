-> 1) Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, hindering immediate understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Church of England's stance to the personal concern for the Church's state without a clear connector.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "the" before "Church of England" could be varied for better flow.
* [STRUCTURE] The introduction of the three principal points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) feels slightly disconnected from the preceding text.
* [SYNTAX] One sentence ("That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.") appears to be garbled or contains a formatting/error, severely impacting fluency.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Could the garbled sentence be a formatting error or a typo? Clarification would significantly impact the fluency score.
- Are there specific guidelines on handling religious or doctrinal terminology that might affect clarity and coherence scores?
