-> 1) Issues: 
[SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences hindering flow
[LEXICON] Archaic language and vocabulary (e.g., "antldiluvians", "veritable")
[STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between ideas
[CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages obscuring main points
[LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking the described location directly to the Garden of Eden without clear evidence)
[TYPO/Grammar] Noted in specific sentences (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...") indicating possible transcription errors or typos

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Are there any specific guidelines on handling archaic texts (given the apparent age suggested by language and references)?
2. Should the evaluation of coherence consider the plausibility of the claim (linking the site to the Garden of Eden) or solely the narrative's internal logic and structure?
