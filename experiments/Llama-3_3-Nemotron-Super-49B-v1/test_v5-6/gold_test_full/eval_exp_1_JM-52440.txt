-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear subheadings or breaks, making navigation challenging.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic vocabulary and sentence structures that hinder comprehension for modern readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without smooth transitions.
* [LEXICON] Outdated language (e.g., "thou", "thee") that may alienate or confuse contemporary readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the historical context of the Church of England and its reforms, potentially leaving some readers uninformed.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the target readers contemporary to the text's original publication, or is this for a modern audience, potentially affecting the fluency score?
* Are there plans for modernization or annotation to enhance clarity and accessibility for broader readership?
