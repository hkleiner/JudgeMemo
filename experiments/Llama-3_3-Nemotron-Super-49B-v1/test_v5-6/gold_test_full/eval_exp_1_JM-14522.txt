-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative flow (e.g., Chapter IV).
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions occasionally obscure the plot (e.g., ghost's past performances).
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones (e.g., from Chapter VI to VII).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and lengthy sentences may hinder readability for some readers.
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., using a dagger, being wet) contradicts typical ghost lore.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the blend of humor and Gothic elements intended to appeal to a specific audience, and if so, which?
* Are there historical or literary references (e.g., "The Vampire Monk") that add depth for knowledgeable readers but might confuse others?
