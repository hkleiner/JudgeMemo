-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with lack of clear sectioning or transitions between ideas
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose and repetitive descriptions hindering ease of understanding
* [LOGIC] Assumptions and claims (e.g., Garden of Eden location) not sufficiently supported by logical evidence
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "antldiluvians", "litteral") may confuse modern readers
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Now, will any one believe us?")

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the text intentionally written in an archaic style to mimic 19th-century literature, or is it a result of the era of its writing?
* Are there any external resources or scholarly reviews that could provide additional context to the author's claims about the Garden of Eden's location?
