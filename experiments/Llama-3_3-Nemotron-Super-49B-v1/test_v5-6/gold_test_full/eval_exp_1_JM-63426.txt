-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters with unclear transitions between life events and thematic discussions.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of names, dates, and specific project details that may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between first-person and second-person narrative voices within the text.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "pi," "Gordon press") that may hinder understanding for modern readers.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (as acknowledged in the Afterword, but still present).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the original chapter divisions and transitions intended for a different medium (e.g., oral presentation, serialized publication) that might explain their current form?
* Would the inclusion of explanatory footnotes or a glossary for antiquated terms enhance reader comprehension without altering the original text?
