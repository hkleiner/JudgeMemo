-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 without clear narrative link.
[CLARITY] Some sentences overly complex or long, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of childhood activities).
[LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "non-archaic") might not be universally accessible.
[TRANSITION] Within Chapter 2, quick shifts between different ages/stages of the protagonist's life could be smoother.
[GRAMMAR] Minor: "It is your second year in school. You now have a step-father." (Lack of transitional phrase for new information).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the two chapters intended to be standalone or is the disconnect between them intentional for a later resolution not provided in the excerpt?
- Would additional transitional phrases or sentences enhance the narrative flow without altering the author's intent?
