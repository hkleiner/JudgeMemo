-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy paragraphs without clear section breaks within chapters, hindering readability.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially confusing readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Scripture to analyzing Church of England documents without a smooth connector.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "whosoever", "thou") may reduce accessibility for modern readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with referenced religious texts and doctrines without brief contextualization.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
Are there specific guidelines on handling archaic language in terms of fluency scoring for modern readership? Should the assumed knowledge of religious texts impact the coherence score?
