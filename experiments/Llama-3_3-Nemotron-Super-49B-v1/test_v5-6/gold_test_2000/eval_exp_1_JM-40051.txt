-> 1) Issues: 
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.")
* [LEXICON] Overly formal and somewhat archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "antldiluvians", "behoeld", "admirirg")
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "behoeld" instead of "beheld")
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow; abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation and geographical description
* [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior biblical knowledge may confuse some readers; some descriptions are overly verbose
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially from biblical discussion to the garden's location

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are there any specific guidelines on handling archaic language in fluency scoring (e.g., should it be penalized for not being modern, or valued for stylistic choice)?
- How should the balance between biblical interpretation and geographical description impact the coherence score, given the text's dual nature?
