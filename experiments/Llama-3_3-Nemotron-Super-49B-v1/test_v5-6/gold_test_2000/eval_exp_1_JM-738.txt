-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and story retelling.
[CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense paragraphs hinder readability.
[LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") may confuse modern readers.
[LOGIC] Assumptions about character intentions (e.g., Jasper's motivations) are not fully supported by the text.
[SYNTAX] Frequent use of long, convoluted sentences disrupts flow.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3

-> 4) Questions: 
Are there any specific guidelines on handling archaic language in fluency scoring? Should the density of historical and literary references impact coherence scoring?
