-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in tone between chapters without clear transition
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions may distract from the main narrative
* [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "guilty spirit", "phantasmata") might hinder readability for modern readers
* [LOGIC] The character's immediate reaction to the ghost (offering lubricant) feels unrealistic and jarring
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt end to Chapter II without resolving the ghost's escape or the family's reaction

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: 
Are there any specific preferences for handling archaic language in scoring fluency (e.g., should it be penalized for not being modern, or valued for authenticity)?
