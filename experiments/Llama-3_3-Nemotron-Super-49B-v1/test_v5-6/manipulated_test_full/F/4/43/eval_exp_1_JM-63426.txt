-> 1) Issues: 
* [COHERENCE] - Non-linear narrative structure may confuse some readers, with abrupt jumps between chapters and topics.
* [CLARITY] - Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed historical settings) might overwhelm the main storyline.
* [TRANSITION] - Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, making the text feel like a collection of separate memoirs.
* [LEXICON] - Archaic vocabulary and printing terminology may hinder understanding for non-experts.
* [GRAMMAR] - Inconsistent tense usage (first-person and second-person narrative) throughout the text.
* [STRUCTURE] - Repetitive information across different chapters (e.g., Strathmore collaborations).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the original memoirs intended for a specialized audience (e.g., printing historians), which might explain the technical jargon and non-linear structure?
* Would additional editorial unity (e.g., consistent tense, clearer transitions) enhance both coherence and overall reader experience without altering the author's voice?
