-> 1) Issues: 
* [COHERENCE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument.
* [COHERENCE] Lack of clear structure; the text jumps between describing the garden, biblical references, and personal anecdotes without a cohesive flow.
* [COHERENCE] Repetitive calls to "come and see" without a clear, concise summary of the garden's location and significance.
* [FLUENCY] Archaic language and overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Now, will any one believe us?") that hinder readability.
* [FLUENCY] Numerous run-on sentences and lack of paragraph breaks, leading to reader fatigue.
* [LEXICON] Overuse of superlatives ("superlatively grand," "overwhelmingly rich") without sufficient descriptive variation.
* [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., the garden's exemption from cyclones) and lack of credible evidence to support the Eden claim.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **2**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **2**

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Was the text possibly written in a late 19th or early 20th-century style, given the language and structure?
2. Are there any known historical or literary contexts that might explain the unconventional approach to proving the garden's identity as Eden?
