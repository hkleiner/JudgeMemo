-> 1) Issues: 
* [LOGIC] Some plot points feel convenient (e.g., the ghost's sudden vulnerability, Virginia's immediate empathy)
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) can be disorienting
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate, archaic language in some descriptions may hinder understanding for modern readers
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between comedic and somber tones
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, word choices are overly complex or outdated (e.g., "gibber," "palsy-twitching")

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the blend of humor and horror intended to appeal to a specific audience or period?
* Are there historical or literary references (e.g., to Longfellow, Lord Byron) that add depth for some readers but might confuse others?
