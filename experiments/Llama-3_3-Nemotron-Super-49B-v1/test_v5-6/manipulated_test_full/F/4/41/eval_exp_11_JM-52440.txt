-> 1) Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing/inconsistent commas, incorrect use of hyphens).
[SPELLING] - Several archaic spellings (e.g., "thou", "thee") which, while historically accurate, may affect modern readability.
[LEXICON] - Overly complex vocabulary and sentence structures, potentially hindering clarity for non-specialist readers.
[STRUCTURE] - Extremely lengthy chapters and paragraphs, disrupting modern reading flow expectations.
[CLARITY] - Repetitive explanations and dense theological jargon may confuse less knowledgeable readers.
[TRANSITION] - Abrupt shifts between scriptural analysis, historical context, and doctrinal critique without clear transitional phrases.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
(The text is highly coherent with a clear, well-structured argument. However, its coherence is slightly diminished by the density of the content and the lack of transitional aids for the reader.)

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
(The text is generally fluent but suffers from minor grammatical errors, overly complex sentence structures, and archaic language, which somewhat hinder the flow.)

-> 4) Questions: 
- Were the archaic spellings and vocabulary intentional for historical authenticity, or would modernization enhance readability without losing the text's essence?
- Would the incorporation of clearer transitional phrases and shorter paragraphs significantly improve readability without altering the text's coherence?
