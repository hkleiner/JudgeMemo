-> 1) Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "biught", "sne", "alk", "difriculty", "enemys", "thier", "recumbent posture" is correct but "recumbant" is a common typo, however, not present here)
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an 'twere in death!")
* [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readers' flow (e.g., "gibber", "thou", "twere")
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter VI and VII (funeral preparation feels somewhat disconnected)
* [CLARITY] A few instances of unclear character motivations or actions (e.g., the ghost's sudden fear of the twins in Chapter V)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
(The story is well-structured, logically sequenced, and effectively builds towards its climax, with only minor disconnects and unclear motivations.)

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
(The text is largely fluent with engaging phrasing, but minor grammatical errors, typos, and archaic language slightly impact the overall flow.)

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the original text ("The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde) intentionally edited for this task, or are the typos and minor errors introduced for evaluation purposes?
* Are there specific guidelines for handling archaic language in the fluency assessment (e.g., considering the story's original publication date)?
