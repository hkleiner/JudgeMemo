-> 1) Issues: 
* [COHERENCE] Overly complex and convoluted plot with multiple unresolved threads
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between analysis, theory, and story retelling
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative language ("I conjecture", "may have", "seems to") hindering clear resolution
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "thou", "whilst") may impede modern readers' understanding
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistent verb tense shifts (e.g., past to present in speculative sections)
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "teh", "unaccountable expedition" repeated without variation for emphasis)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the intended resolution of Edwin Drood's fate (alive or dead) ever conclusively decided by Dickens, or is it truly lost?
* How does the author expect readers to reconcile the speculative nature of the analysis with the presented "evidence" from the story?
