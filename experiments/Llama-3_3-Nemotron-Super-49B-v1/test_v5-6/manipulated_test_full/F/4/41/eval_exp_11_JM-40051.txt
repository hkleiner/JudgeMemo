-> 1) Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of grammatical errors (e.g., "tje" instead of "the", "snd" instead of "and", missing articles)
* [SPELLING] Numerous spelling mistakes (e.g., "veritablebgarden", "teh", "mounld-builders")
* [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic vocabulary and overly complex sentence structures hindering clarity
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., shifting from geography to biblical interpretation without clear connections)
* [CLARITY] Excessive verbosity and repetitive descriptions (e.g., multiple elaborations on the garden's beauty)
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
-> 4) Questions: 
- Were there any editorial or proofreading processes applied to the text before publication, given the high frequency of basic errors?
- Is the target audience presumed to have a strong background in biblical studies and geography, given the assumptions made in the text?
