-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with lack of clear sectioning or transitions between ideas
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose and repetitive descriptions hindering ease of understanding
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and overly formal tone may alienate some readers
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not convincingly supported by evidence
* [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "commencement" used incorrectly in some contexts)
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, geographical description, and personal anecdote

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the target audience specifically religious or academic, as the tone suggests a specialized readership?
* Are there plans for editing to address the identified structural and clarity issues?
