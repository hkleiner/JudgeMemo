-> 1) Issues: 
* [COHERENCE] Minor disconnect in tone between humorous and somber moments (e.g., transition from Chapter VI to VII)
* [STRUCTURE] Predictable yet effective use of chapters; some scenes feel slightly disconnected from the main narrative arc
* [CLARITY] A few instances of overly elaborate, archaic language may confuse modern readers (e.g., "perdition seize the naughty fowl")
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, word choices are overly ornate or less common (e.g., "gibber," "palsy-twitching")
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., using a dagger, being wet) is sometimes inconsistent with typical ghost lore

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the original text ("The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde) intended to be evaluated in its entirety, or was a specific aspect (e.g., a particular chapter's coherence) to be focused on? 
* Are there any specific preferences for handling archaic language in the fluency score (e.g., should it be penalized more heavily for modern readers)?
