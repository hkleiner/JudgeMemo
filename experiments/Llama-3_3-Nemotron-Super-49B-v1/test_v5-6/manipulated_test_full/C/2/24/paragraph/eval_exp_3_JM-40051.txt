-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with lack of clear sectioning or transitions between ideas
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose and repetitive descriptions hindering ease of understanding
* [LOGIC] Assumptions and claims (e.g., Garden of Eden location) not sufficiently supported by logical evidence
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "antldiluvians") may confuse modern readers
* [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences impairing readability
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, geographical description, and personal anecdote

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **2**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the text intentionally written in an archaic style to mimic 19th-century literature, or is it a result of the era of its writing?
* Are there any external resources or footnotes (e.g., for Dr. Warren, Moritz Engel) that could enhance the text's credibility and coherence?
