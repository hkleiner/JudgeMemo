-> 1) Issues: 
* [LOGIC] Minor inconsistencies in timeline and character actions (e.g., ghost's ability to interact physically at times, inconsistent fear responses from characters)
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between some chapters/scenes without clear temporal or contextual bridges
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate, archaic language in some descriptions may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers
* [LEXICON] Anachronistic elements (e.g., "deepfake filter", "voice command triggered automation", "wireless charger", "AI core", "biosensor", "self-driving cart") disrupt historical setting
* [TRANSITION] Sudden, unexplained appearances of modern technology terms

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Were the anachronistic technological references intentional for a specific narrative effect, or oversights?
2. Is there an intended deeper thematic connection between the historical setting and the brief, jarring modern elements?
