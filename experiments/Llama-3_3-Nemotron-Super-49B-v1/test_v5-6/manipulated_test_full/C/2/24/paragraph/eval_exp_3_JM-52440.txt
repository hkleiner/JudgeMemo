-> 1) Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] - Occasionally, paragraphs are overly long, potentially hindering readability.
[CLARITY] - Some sentences are convoluted, requiring re-reading for full comprehension.
[TRANSITION] - Transitions between chapters and sometimes within lengthy paragraphs could be smoother.
[LEXICON] - Repetitive use of certain phrases (e.g., "our blessed Saviour/Lord") could be varied for better flow.
[LOGIC] - Assumptions about opponents' beliefs are made without direct evidence within the text.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
- Are the referenced Church of England documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies) expected to be familiar to the target audience, or would additional context enhance clarity?
- Would incorporating direct quotes from opposing views (e.g., Dr. Pusey) within the text, rather than just referencing them, strengthen the argument's coherence?
