-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters with unclear transitions between life events and thematic discussions.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of names, dates, and specific project details that may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between first-person and second-person narrative voices within the text.
* [LEXICON] Archaic terms and industry jargon (e.g., "pi," "Gordon press") without explanation may hinder understanding for non-experts.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., switching between past and present) in some sections.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the target readers assumed to have prior knowledge of the graphic design and printing history of the late 19th and early 20th centuries?
* Is there an intended audience for whom the detailed, named references would hold specific significance?
