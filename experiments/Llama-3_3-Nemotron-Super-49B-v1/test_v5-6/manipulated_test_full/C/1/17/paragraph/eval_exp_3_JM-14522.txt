-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes (e.g., random historical tangents, sudden shifts in narrative focus)
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate, archaic language in some passages hinders immediate understanding
* [LOGIC] Some plot elements (e.g., the ghost's final transformation, certain character reactions) feel unexplained or convenient
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, word choices are overly ornate or outdated, affecting readability
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the ghost's attempts and the final, more somber scenes

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the original text ("The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde) intended to be evaluated in its entirety, or was a specific aspect (e.g., a modern edit, a particular chapter) the focus? 
* Are there any specific guidelines on handling well-known literary works (potential bias towards familiarity with the story)?
