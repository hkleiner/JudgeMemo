-> 1) Issues: 
* [COHERENCE] Overly complex and convoluted plot with multiple unresolved threads
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between chapters and ideas
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative theories and authorial commentary disrupts the story
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and lengthy descriptions may hinder modern reader comprehension
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistencies in tense and pronoun reference
* [TRANSITION] Poor connections between the main story and the "Theories of the Mystery" section

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the text intentionally written in an archaic style to mimic the era of Dickens, or is it a transcription/editing issue?
* Are the speculative theories and authorial comments part of the original story or added commentary by another author/critic? Clarification on this would significantly impact the coherence score.
