-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters and unrelated narrative inserts (e.g., descriptions of art, unrelated character stories)
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense theological jargon may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between discussing different Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies)
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases ("it is clear", "thus") without variation
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with specific theological debates and Church of England documents without sufficient context

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the narrative inserts (e.g., about Jasper, George Stransom) intended to illustrate theological points or were they errors in text compilation?
* Is the target audience exclusively theological scholars or is the text intended for a broader readership within the Church of England?
