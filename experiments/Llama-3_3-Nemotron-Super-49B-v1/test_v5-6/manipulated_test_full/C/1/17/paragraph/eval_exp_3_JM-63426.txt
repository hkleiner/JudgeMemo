-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between chapters and topics
* [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages hindering main storyline progression
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between different life periods and projects
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "make-up," "lay-out") may confuse modern readers

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the non-linear narrative and archaic language intentional stylistic choices to reflect the era in which the subject lived, or are they considered flaws in the text's presentation?
* Would additional contextual information (e.g., footnotes, a glossary) enhance clarity and coherence for modern readers?
