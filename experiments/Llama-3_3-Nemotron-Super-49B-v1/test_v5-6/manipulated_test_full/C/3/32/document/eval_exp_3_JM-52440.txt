-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and paragraphs, hindering readability.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex theological jargon without clear explanations.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without smooth connections.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases (e.g., "our blessed Saviour/Lord") without variation.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and documents.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were the target readers assumed to have a strong background in Anglican theology and history, given the lack of introductory explanations for key terms and documents? 
* Would the text benefit from a table of contents or subheadings to enhance structure and readability?
