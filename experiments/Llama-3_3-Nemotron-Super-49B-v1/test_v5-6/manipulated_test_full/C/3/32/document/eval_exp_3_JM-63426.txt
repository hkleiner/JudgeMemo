-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between chapters and topics
* [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages hindering main storyline progression
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between life events and thematic shifts
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "the thing", unclear references) causing confusion
* [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent tense usage (first-person, second-person, varying tenses)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Were there any specific instructions or context provided for the annotator regarding the handling of archaic language or unclear references (e.g., "the thing") that could improve fluency and coherence scores?
* Is the primary focus of the evaluation on the autobiographical text's literary merit or its effectiveness as a historical/biographical document, which might influence scoring?
