-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative flow (e.g., Chapter IV).
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions occasionally obscure the plot (e.g., ghost's numerous disguises).
* [LOGIC] A few plot points rely on convenient coincidences (e.g., the gipsies' sudden departure).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and lengthy sentences may hinder readability for some readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones (e.g., from Chapter VI to VII).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**

-> 4) Questions: 
* Was the original text ("The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde) intended for a specific audience that might mitigate some of the noted issues (e.g., familiarity with Victorian humor and style)? 
* Are the disconnections in structure (noted in Issue 1) a deliberate choice for comedic effect or pacing, potentially altering the coherence score in a different contextual evaluation?
