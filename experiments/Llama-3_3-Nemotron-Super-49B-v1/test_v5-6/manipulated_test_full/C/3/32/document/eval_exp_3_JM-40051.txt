-> 1) Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Excessively lengthy and repetitive descriptions
* [CLARITY] Overuse of vague terms (e.g., "a thing", "stuff") without clear reference
* [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims and assumptions (e.g., linking location to Garden of Eden without robust evidence)
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and inconsistent terminology
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive, argumentative, and inspirational sections
* [GRAMMAR] Sporadic use of incorrect punctuation and capitalization
* [SPELLING] Occasional spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg")

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
(Rationale: While the text has a clear central claim, its coherence is heavily undermined by poor structure, repetition, vague terms, and unconvincing logical connections, making the overall narrative disjointed and hard to follow.)

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
(Rationale: Significant issues with grammar, spelling, and especially lexicon (archaic and inconsistent language) hinder fluency. The text's flow is frequently interrupted by errors, awkward phrasing, and the need to decipher unclear references.)

-> 4) Questions: 
1. Was the text possibly written in a different era due to its language style, or is it an intentional archaism?
2. Are there any known historical contexts or figures (e.g., the author, referenced scholars) that could provide clarity on the vague terms and claims?
