### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **Occasional complex sentence structures may hinder immediate clarity for some readers.**
   - **No outright grammatical errors noted.**

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **No noticeable errors.**

3. **Word Choice**:
   - **Formal vocabulary appropriate for the subject matter but may alienate less knowledgeable readers.**
   - **Some sentences could benefit from more concise wording for better flow.**

4. **Phrasing**:
   - **A few phrases are somewhat archaic (e.g., "it is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion") but not overly distracting.**
   - **Generally well-structured, with some room for modernization.**

5. **Flow**:
   - **Transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth, but the text's density can make it feel sluggish at times.**
   - **Subheadings help, but the lack of summary sentences at the end of each chapter(section) might leave the reader wondering about the immediate conclusion.**

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Overall logical, with a clear introduction of the problem and a structured approach to addressing it.**
   - **Minor detours (e.g., the brief mention of the Church's current state) that, while relevant, slightly interrupt the flow of the main argument.**

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **Key points are reiterated for emphasis, which is helpful given the text's complexity, but could be more concise.**

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Transitions between ideas within paragraphs are generally smooth.**
   - **Could benefit from clearer signaling of shifts in focus (e.g., from Scripture to Church documents).**

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **The text assumes a baseline understanding of theological terms and the controversy at hand, which might confuse uninitiated readers.**
   - **Definitions provided are clear, but the overall context might still challenge those without a religious studies background.**

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Consistent in its formal, argumentative structure.**
   - **The depth of analysis is consistent, though the text could benefit from a concluding summary to reinforce the structure.**
