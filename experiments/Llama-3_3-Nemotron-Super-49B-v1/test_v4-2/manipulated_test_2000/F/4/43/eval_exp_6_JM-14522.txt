### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* **Minor**: A few complex sentences may slightly impede immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.").
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **None Notable** in the provided text snippet.
3. **Word Choice**:
	* **Minor**: Occasionally, very formal or less common vocabulary might reduce fluency for non-native English speakers or younger readers (e.g., "punctilious", "receptive expectations", "sanguineous").
4. **Phrasing**:
	* **Minor**: Some phrasings are delightfully archaic or humorous, which might slow down reading for those not accustomed to such styles (e.g., the entire dialogue with the ghost, especially Mr. Otis's lines).
5. **Flow**:
	* **Minor**: Transitions between descriptive passages and dialogue are generally smooth, but the shift in tone (e.g., from horror elements to comedic dialogue with the ghost) might slightly disrupt flow for some readers.

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **None Notable**: Events unfold logically.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **Minor**: The re-appearance of the blood stain is repetitive but serves a narrative purpose.
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Minor**: The transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" is abrupt and confusing due to the lack of a proper chapter title or indicator of time/place shift.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Minor**: The character development of the family, especially beyond their introductory traits, is somewhat lacking, which might leave some readers slightly disconnected.
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Minor Issue with Chapter Transition**: As mentioned, the transition to the second chapter is structurally inconsistent and confusing.
