**Fluency Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints)**

* **Syntax and Grammar**: 
	+ Generally strong, but occasional complex sentences may impede immediate understanding (e.g., "He began very early. He takes this drug both in his lodgings...").
	+ **Minor Issue**
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: 
	+ Several typos noticed (e.g., "deserfed" instead of "deserted", "ajd" instead of "and", "oeft" instead of "left", "apopldxy" instead of "apoplexy", "notvout" instead of "not without", "disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasperâ€™s birth" - missing punctuation for clarity).
	+ **Moderate Issue**
* **Word Choice**: 
	+ Vocabulary is mostly appropriate and enriching (e.g., "buoyancy", "seducing", "frolicsome"), but some words feel slightly archaic or less common ("gamin", "frolicsome"), which might affect readability for all audiences.
	+ **Minor Issue**
* **Phrasing**: 
	+ Generally well-structured, but a few phrases are wordy or awkwardly worded (e.g., "the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings'").
	+ **Minor Issue**
* **Flow**: 
	+ Transitions between paragraphs and ideas are mostly smooth, but the shift from analysis to the story's dramatis personae feels somewhat abrupt.
	+ **Minor Issue**

**Coherence Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints)**

* **Logical Sequencing**: 
	+ The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing Dickens's writing style to introducing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a clear connector.
	+ The transition from the preface to "THE STORY" chapter could be smoother.
	+ **Moderate Issue**
* **Non-repetitiveness**: 
	+ No significant repetition of information without adding new insights.
	+ **No Issue**
* **Smooth Connections**: 
	+ Transitions within the story part ("THE STORY") are generally smooth, but the overall text could benefit from clearer links between the introductory analysis and the story breakdown.
	+ **Minor Issue**
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: 
	+ A few points assume prior knowledge of Dickens's works or characters without brief context (e.g., "the pathetic Jo of Bleak House"),
