### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "I is ignorant", "we woulded have been")
   - Incorrect tense usage in several places
   - Misplaced or missing articles ("a large city", "the garden one of the four notable rivers")

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - Noticeable spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "minded", "was" instead of "were" in some contexts, "jageed")
   - Inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing commas for clarity, improper use of dashes)

3. **Word Choice**:
   - Overly formal or archaic vocabulary in some contexts ("veritable", "antideluvians", "thoroughly satisfied") that may hinder smooth reading for all audiences
   - Repetitive use of "our" before "garden" (could vary for flow)

4. **Phrasing**:
   - Awkwardly worded sentences (e.g., "had venture to published it", "had a clue; 'And Lot lifted up his eyes...'")

5. **Flow**:
   - Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from biblical discussion to geographical description without clear linking)
   - Lengthy, dense paragraphs hindering easy flow

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - Non-linear presentation of ideas (e.g., discovery announcement precedes the full discovery context)
   - Lack of clear introduction to the geographical location before its detailed description

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - Redundant mentions of the garden's beauty without adding new insights

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - Abrupt shift from scientific speculation to the author's personal experience
   - Lack of transitional phrases between different sections

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of biblical references and geographical locations
   - Unclear in some parts how the described location perfectly matches the biblical Eden (needs more explicit connections)

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - Inconsistent narrative voice (shifts between formal argument and informal, personal anecdotes)
   - Lack of a clear conclusion summarizing the discovery's significance
