**Fluency Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints)**

* **Syntax and Grammar**: 
	+ Generally strong, with only occasional complex sentences that may slightly impede immediate understanding.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: 
	+ **Issue**: No noticeable errors, but the text includes unexplained abbreviations (e.g., "A livestream began recording." seems out of context and possibly a formatting error).
* **Word Choice**: 
	+ **Issue**: Some vocabulary is somewhat archaic (e.g., "demned", "gamin", "thou") which might affect modern readers' fluency.
	+ **Strength**: Mostly appropriate and contributes to a formal, scholarly tone.
* **Phrasing**: 
	+ **Issue**: A few phrases are wordy or awkward (e.g., "the first sprightly runnings", "fared worse in the too material premonitions").
* **Flow**: 
	+ **Issue**: Transitions between historical context, analysis, and story summary can feel abrupt.
	+ **Strength**: Overall, the text flows well within each section.

**Coherence Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints)**

* **Logical Sequencing**: 
	+ **Issue**: The narrative jumps abruptly from analysis to the story's dramatis personae without clear transition.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: 
	+ **Strength**: No significant repetition noted.
* **Smooth Connections**: 
	+ **Issue**: Transitions between discussing Dickens' life, the analysis of "Edwin Drood", and the story's elements could be smoother.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: 
	+ **Issue**: Assumes prior knowledge of Dickens' works and their context, which might confuse unfamiliar readers.
	+ **Issue**: The sudden, unexplained appearance of "A livestream began recording." is highly confusing and disrupts coherence.
* **Structural Consistency**: 
	+ **Strength**: The text is well-structured within its scholarly format.
	+ **Issue**: The mix of critique, biography, and story summary could be more clearly delineated.

**FINAL Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
*Rationale: While the text is mostly coherent within its sections, the abrupt transitions, assumption of prior knowledge, and the unexplained "livestream" line significantly impact its overall coherence.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
*Rationale: Despite some archaic vocabulary, wordy phrases, and the puzzling formatting error, the text
