### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **Minor**: A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering immediate clarity (e.g., the first sentence of the introduction).
   - **Score Aspect: 4** (mostly clear, minor adjustments for optimal clarity)

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **None Notable**
   - **Score Aspect: 5**

3. **Word Choice**:
   - **Minor**: Some archaic language ("thou", "thee", not present but "whomsoever" is) and theological jargon might reduce accessibility for non-specialist readers.
   - **Score Aspect: 4** (effective for the target audience, assumed to be familiar with theological discourse)

4. **Phrasing**:
   - **Minor**: Occasionally, phrasing is slightly formal or outdated for modern readers ("It is my desire", "I presume we are all agreed").
   - **Score Aspect: 4** (mostly effective, minor modernization could enhance readability)

5. **Flow**:
   - **Noticeable**: Transitions between paragraphs or sections could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing Scripture to the Church of England's documents feels somewhat abrupt.
   - **Score Aspect: 3** (some disruption in the narrative flow)

**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Generally Strong**: The text logically progresses from introduction to specific doctrinal analysis.
   - **Score Aspect: 5**

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **Minor Repetition**: The emphasis on the distinction between the Church of England's doctrine and others is repeated, though largely justified for clarity.
   - **Score Aspect: 4**

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Similar to Flow in Fluency**: Transitions between some sections (e.g., from Scripture discussion to Church documents) could be more fluid.
   - **Score Aspect: 3** (echoing the flow issue, affecting coherence)

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **Strong**: Complex theological concepts are clearly defined (e.g., "The real objective presence").
   - **Score Aspect: 5**

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Strong**:
