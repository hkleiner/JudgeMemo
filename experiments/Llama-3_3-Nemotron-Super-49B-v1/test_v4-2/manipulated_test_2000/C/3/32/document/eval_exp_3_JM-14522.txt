### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **None notable**; the text exhibits well-constructed sentences.
   
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **"a thing"** (repeated, appears to be a placeholder or error, e.g., "since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was frightened... by a thing").
   - **Potential missing articles or minor punctuation preferences** (varies by style guide, not disruptive).

3. **Word Choice**:
   - **Occasional archaic vocabulary** (e.g., "whilst" not present but "thou" equivalents in formality) might affect modern readers' fluency.
   - **"a stuff"** (another apparent placeholder/error, impacting clarity).

4. **Phrasing**:
   - **Generally well-structured**, with some **long, complex sentences** that might slow reading for some.

5. **Flow**:
   - **Transitions between scenes/chapters are clear**.
   - **Abrupt shift in tone/dialogue style in Chapter II's ghost encounter** (humorous approach to a spooky situation, which might not disrupt fluency for all readers but could surprise some).

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Events unfold logically**, with a clear narrative progression.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **The re-appearance of the blood stain is repetitive by design** (to build the ghost narrative), so **contextually justified**.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Chapter to chapter transitions are smooth**.
   - **Sudden introduction of the ghost's appearance** (while expected, the transition from everyday conversation to the encounter feels somewhat abrupt).

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **"a thing" and "a stuff"** create ambiguity due to apparent errors/placeholders.
   - **Character motivations and backstories are mostly clear**.

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Narrative structure is consistent and clear**.
   - **Tone shifts** (serious to humorous in ghost encounter) might feel inconsistent to some readers.
