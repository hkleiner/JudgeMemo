Below is the assessment of the text's quality in terms of **Fluency** and **Coherence**, followed by the final scores as requested.

---

### **Fluency Evaluation**

#### **Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **Generally Strong**, with complex sentences structured correctly.
   - **Minor Issue**: A few sentences are overly long, potentially confusing readers (e.g., the paragraph describing Jasper's opium use and its implications).

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **No Noticeable Errors** in the provided excerpt.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - **Appropriate and Engaging** for the most part.
   - **Minor Quibble**: Occasional use of less common vocabulary might alienate some readers (e.g., "gamin", "precentor" without immediate context).

4. **Phrasing**:
   - **Generally Smooth**.
   - **Awkward Phrasing in Places**: E.g., "the bloom is off the plum of their prearranged loves" feels slightly forced.

5. **Flow**:
   - **Smooth Transitions Between Scenes**.
   - **Slight Disruption**: The shift from analytical introduction to the story's opening feels somewhat abrupt without a clearer bridge.

### **Coherence Evaluation**

#### **Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Well-Structured** narrative flow within the story part.
   - **Introduction Could Better Prepare** for the story's deep dive, enhancing the transition.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **No Unnecessary Repetitions** observed in the provided text.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Character Introductions Are Clear**.
   - **Minor Gap**: The significance of the opium den's detailed description to the overall plot isn't immediately clear without more context.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **Characters' Motivations Generally Clear**.
   - **Ambiguity Intended for Plot Mystery** (e.g., Jasper's full intentions, the fate of Edwin Drood), which is appropriate.

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Consistent in Narrative Voice and Style**.
   - **Structural Shift from Analysis to Narrative** could be smoother.
