### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* Generally strong, with only occasional complex sentences that might slightly impede immediate understanding.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **Issue**: Notable absence of quotation marks around dialogue in some instances (e.g., in "CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING").
	* **Issue**: Inconsistent spacing or formatting (likely a formatting error in the provided text, e.g., abrupt line breaks without clear paragraph separation).
3. **Word Choice**:
	* **Strength**: Vivid and appropriate for the narrative, enhancing the reading experience.
4. **Phrasing**:
	* **Issue**: Some phrases feel slightly archaic ("the mere joy of knowing how much more they were 'worth'"), which might not appeal to all readers but suits the historical context.
5. **Flow**:
	* **Issue**: Abrupt transition from discussing Will Bradley's work to the detailed, unrelated narrative of "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without a clear connecting device.

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **Issue**: The narrative jumps abruptly from Will Bradley's introduction to a completely different story ("The Boy Printer of Ishpeming") without logical connection or transition.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **Strength**: No significant repetition noted.
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Issue**: Lack of smooth transition between the two distinct narrative parts.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Issue**: The connection (or lack thereof) between the two chapters is ambiguous, potentially confusing readers.
	* **Issue**: In "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming", the shift in narrative voice (from third person to what appears to be a first-person reminiscence without clear demarcation) might cause confusion.
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Issue**: Inconsistency in narrative structure between the two chapters, disrupting overall coherence.

### **FINAL Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
*Rationale: While each chapter internally has a logical flow, the abrupt and unexplained transition between them significantly impacts the overall coherence. Ambiguities in narrative connections and voice shifts in the second chapter further reduce the score.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
