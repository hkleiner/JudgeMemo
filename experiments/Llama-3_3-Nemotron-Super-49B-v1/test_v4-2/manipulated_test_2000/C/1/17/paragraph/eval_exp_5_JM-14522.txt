### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **None notable**; overall grammatically correct.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **None notable**; appears error-free.
3. **Word Choice**:
   - Occasionally **archaic vocabulary** might hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "whilst" not used but "methinks" or similar archaisms could be, though not present).
   - **Effective** in setting the narrative's period and tone.
4. **Phrasing**:
   - **Some sentences are lengthy and complex**, potentially causing slight readability issues for all audiences.
   - Generally, **well-structured**.
5. **Flow**:
   - **Transitions between chapters/scenes** are mostly smooth.
   - **Abrupt shift in narrative voice/style** in the Christmas Day reflection (appears out of context with the rest of the story).

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Generally logical**, except for the **unconnected Christmas Day passage** which disrupts the narrative flow.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **The reappearing blood stain** is repetitive but **used effectively for plot progression**.
3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Most transitions are smooth**; however, the **insertion of the Christmas Day commentary** feels disconnected.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **Character introductions and settings** are mostly clear.
   - **Sudden narrative voice change** in one section causes ambiguity.
5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Consistent in narrative style except for one out-of-place section** (Christmas Day thoughts).
