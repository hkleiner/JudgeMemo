### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints (Affected Aspect)**

* **Syntax and Grammar**: 
	+ A few archaic sentence structures may confuse modern readers (e.g., "I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,") but are largely intentional for period authenticity.
	+ **Score Impact: -0.5** (minor, stylistic choice)
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: 
	+ **None Noted**
	+ **Score Impact: 0**
* **Word Choice**:
	+ Occasionally, word choices are overly elaborate or less common (e.g., "punctilious", "sanguineous", "gibber"), which might slow reading for some.
	+ **Score Impact: -1**
* **Phrasing**:
	+ Some phrases feel slightly awkward or too formal for modern taste (e.g., "I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,").
	+ **Score Impact: -1**
* **Flow**:
	+ Transitions between chapters and sometimes within long paragraphs can feel abrupt.
	+ **Score Impact: -1.5**

**FINAL Fluency Score: 2.0** (Calculated as 5 - (0.5 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1.5) = 2.0, reflecting a more formulaic approach to scoring based on impact levels)

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints (Affected Aspect)**

* **Logical Sequencing**:
	+ The narrative jumps abruptly from the ghost's attempts to scare the family to Virginia's final interaction without clear build-up.
	+ **Score Impact: -1.5**
* **Non-repetitiveness**:
	+ **None Noted** (Repetitions, if any, serve thematic or comedic purposes)
	+ **Score Impact: 0**
* **Smooth Connections**:
	+ Transitions between chapters and some scenes (e.g., the sudden appearance of the "YE OTIS GHOSTE" section) lack smoothness.
	+ **Score Impact: -1**
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	+ The ghost's final transformation and the mechanism of his death through Virginia's actions could
