### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **Minor Issues**: A few complex sentences may impede immediate understanding, but overall, syntax and grammar are **strong**.
   - **Example**: "If the bread and wine had by consecration become the body and blood, this clearly would be impossible..." (Could be simplified for clarity)

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **No Notable Errors**: Text appears to be error-free in this regard.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - **Formal but Appropriate**: Vocabulary is suited to the theological and historical context, though somewhat archaic in places.
   - **Example**: "Verily", "thee", "thou" (Archaisms that might affect modern readers' fluency)

4. **Phrasing**:
   - **Generally Clear**: Phrases are well-structured, with occasional complexity due to the subject matter.
   - **Example for Improvement**: "It is most important to observe that word ‘only,’ for it is exclusive of all material feeding." (Could be slightly rephrased for smoother flow)

5. **Flow**:
   - **Transitions Between Ideas**: Mostly smooth, but the text jumps between different works/authors without clear transitional phrases at times.
   - **Example**: The abrupt shift from discussing the Catechism to quoting Millet's "The Sower" without a linking idea.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Generally Logical**: The text follows a logical path through the topics of Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice.
   - **Minor Detour**: The inclusion of unrelated passages (e.g., about Millet, George Stransom) disrupts the logical flow.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **Some Redundancy**: Key points (e.g., the Church of England's stance on transubstantiation) are repeated for emphasis, which, while helpful for clarity, borders on redundancy.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Mostly Achieved**: Connections between sections are generally clear, except for the aforementioned unrelated passages.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **Clear Stances**: The text clearly states its positions, though the complexity of the
