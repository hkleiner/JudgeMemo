**Coherence Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints by Aspect)**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **Generally Logical**: Ideas follow a logical path, especially within each section, but the overall narrative jumps (e.g., from analysis to character theories) might confuse.
	* **Score**: 4/5
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **Some Redundancy**: Key points (e.g., Datchery's identity theories) are revisited without significant new insight, feeling slightly repetitive.
	* **Score**: 3.5/5
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Could Be Improved**: Transitions between different theory discussions or character analyses are sometimes abrupt.
	* **Score**: 3/5
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Intentional Ambiguity**: Given the text's nature (analyzing an unfinished mystery), some ambiguity is inherent and well-managed.
	* **Score**: 4.5/5
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Varies by Section**: Analytical parts are well-structured, but
