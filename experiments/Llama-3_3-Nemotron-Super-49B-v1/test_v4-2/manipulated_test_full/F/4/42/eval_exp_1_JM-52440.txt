### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* **Minor Issues**: A few complex sentences may impede immediate understanding, but overall, syntax is correct.
	* **Example**: "If the bread and wine had by consecration become the body and blood, this clearly would be impossible, for the one being changed into the other, the two would be inseparable, or rather, they would cease to be two, they would be one."
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **No Notable Errors**
3. **Word Choice**:
	* **Generally Appropriate**: Formal and theological vocabulary suits the context, though may challenge non-specialist readers.
	* **Example**: "Transubstantiation", "Consubstantiation" (assumed to be known or easily looked up)
4. **Phrasing**:
	* **Occasional Awkwardness**: Some phrasings are slightly archaic or overly formal, potentially affecting flow.
	* **Example**: "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him"
5. **Flow**:
	* **Generally Smooth**: Despite length, the text transitions well between ideas, aided by clear chapter divisions.
	* **Minor Issue**: Some paragraphs are lengthy, which might disrupt flow for some readers.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **Well-Structured**: The text logically progresses from introduction through themed chapters.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **Some Redundancy**: Key points (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified) are repeated for emphasis, bordering on redundancy.
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Clear Transitions**: Chapter to chapter, and within chapters, transitions are smooth and well-signaled.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Generally Clear**: Though complex, the author clarifies key theological distinctions.
	* **Minor Ambiguity**: Assumes a baseline understanding of theological terms without initial explanation.
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Consistent**: The narrative argues a clear, consistent position against the backdrop of Church of England documents.
