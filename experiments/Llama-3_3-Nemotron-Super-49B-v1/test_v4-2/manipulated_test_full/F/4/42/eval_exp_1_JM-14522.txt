### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* **Minor**: A few archaic constructions (e.g., "was am", "woulded") likely intentional for period authenticity.
	* **Score: 4/5** (deduction for occasional awkwardness despite being stylistic)
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **Excellent**: No noticeable errors.
	* **Score: 5/5**
3. **Word Choice**:
	* **Excellent**: Vocabulary is rich, appropriate, and enhances the reading experience.
	* **Score: 5/5**
4. **Phrasing**:
	* **Generally Good**: Mostly well-structured, with some lengthy sentences that slightly impede flow.
	* **Score: 4/5** (deduction for occasional sentence length)
5. **Flow**:
	* **Good to Excellent**: Transitions between sentences and chapters are generally smooth, with a clear narrative progression.
	* **Score: 4.5/5** (minor deduction for chapter transitions feeling slightly abrupt at times)

**FINAL Fluency Score:** **4.4/5** (Rounded from averaging the above scores)

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **Excellent**: Events unfold logically, contributing to the narrative's progression.
	* **Score: 5/5**
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **Good**: While the blood-stain's appearance is repeated, it serves a narrative purpose and isn't overly repetitive.
	* **Score: 4/5** (minor deduction for the repetitive yet justified blood-stain motif)
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Generally Good**: Chapter to chapter connections are clear, though some transitions feel slightly abrupt.
	* **Score: 4/5** (same reasoning as Fluency's Flow)
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Excellent for the Most Part**: The narrative is clear, though the final resolution with the ghost and Virginia might leave some questions for some readers.
	* **Score: 4.5/5** (minor deduction for the slightly ambiguous final interaction's implications)
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Excellent**: The narrative structure (chapters, progression from introduction to resolution) is consistent
