**Fluency Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints by Aspect)**

* **Syntax and Grammar**: 
	+ Generally strong, with complex sentence structures effectively used.
	+ Occasional overly long sentences may impede immediate clarity (e.g., in theoretical discussions).
	**Issue Level: Low**
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: 
	+ No noticeable errors.
	**Issue Level: None**
* **Word Choice**: 
	+ Rich and appropriate vocabulary, enhancing the narrative.
	+ Some archaic terms (e.g., "thou", "thee") in quoted dialogue feel slightly out of place in modern reading but are contextually justified.
	**Issue Level: Very Low**
* **Phrasing**: 
	+ Mostly well-structured, though some phrases in analytical sections feel slightly awkward due to their speculative nature.
	**Issue Level: Low**
* **Flow**: 
	+ Transitions between narrative summary and analytical/theoretical sections can feel abrupt.
	+ The text's dual nature (summary and analysis) sometimes disrupts the flow for readers seeking a consistent narrative or deep dive into theory.
	**Issue Level: Moderate**

**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**

**Coherence Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints by Aspect)**

* **Logical Sequencing**: 
	+ The narrative summary is well-sequenced.
	+ Analytical sections sometimes jump between theories without clear transitional logic.
	**Issue Level: Moderate**
* **Non-repetitiveness**: 
	+ Some points (e.g., the significance of Datchery's identity) are revisited multiple times without substantial new insight each time.
	**Issue Level: Moderate**
* **Smooth Connections**: 
	+ Transitions between discussing the story and its theories/the author's intentions could be smoother.
	**Issue Level: Moderate**
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: 
	+ The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and literary analysis, potentially leaving some readers unclear on certain references.
	+ Theoretical discussions, by their nature, involve speculation, but this is mostly well-flagged.
	**Issue Level: Moderate**
* **Structural Consistency**: 
	+ The structure (Summary > Theories > Evidence from Illustrations > Conclusions) is clear but could benefit from clearer section headings for easier navigation.
	**Issue Level: Low**

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5** (Rounded to **4** for the final score,
