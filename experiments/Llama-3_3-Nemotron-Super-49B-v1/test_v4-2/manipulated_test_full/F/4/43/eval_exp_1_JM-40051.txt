### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - Frequent use of overly complex, convoluted sentence structures.
   - Occasional incorrect subject-verb agreement (e.g., "the mound-builders were silent. And every new comer...").
   - Lack of consistency in tense (e.g., switching between past and present without clear reason).

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **No noticeable spelling errors**.
   - Excessive use of commas, leading to breathless, hard-to-follow sentences.
   - Inconsistent use of quotation marks (e.g., around Bible quotes and general emphasis).

3. **Word Choice**:
   - **Generally appropriate vocabulary** for the topic.
   - Overuse of superlatives ("superlatively grand", "overwhelmingly rich") without sufficient contrast.
   - Some archaic or less common words might alienate modern readers (e.g., "antideluvians", "litteral").

4. **Phrasing**:
   - **Many awkwardly worded phrases** (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing", "the one half of its greatness was not told").
   - Repetitive phrasing for emphasis ("Come and see!!" repeated).

5. **Flow**:
   - **Abrupt transitions** between paragraphs/topics without clear linking.
   - Information density varies greatly, with some paragraphs feeling overly packed.

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Topics jump abruptly** (e.g., from garden description to geological age without transition).
   - Lack of clear outline or progression in argument-building.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **Repetition of the "Come and see" invitation** and the garden's superiority without adding new insights.
   - Redundant descriptions of the garden's beauty.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Lack of transitional phrases** between ideas.
   - Sudden shifts in focus (e.g., from Biblical analysis to dairy farming).

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **Assumes reader's deep Biblical knowledge** without clarification.
   - Unclear references (e.g., "the mound-builders" without explanation).

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Inconsistent narrative voice** (shift
