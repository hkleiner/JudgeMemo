### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints (by Aspect)**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* **Minor**: A few archaic constructions (e.g., "whom" in object positions, "had been" in places for modern "was") for stylistic effect, fitting the narrative's period setting.
	* **Score: 4/5** (Very few to no distracting errors)
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **None Noted**: Assuming the provided text's intentional archaisms and the absence of reported errors, the text appears flawless.
	* **Score: 5/5**
3. **Word Choice**:
	* **Minor**: Occasionally overly elaborate for modern taste (e.g., "vulgar materialism"), but suits the narrative's Victorian parody tone.
	* **Score: 4.5/5** (Effective for the story's tone, with minimal distraction)
4. **Phrasing**:
	* **Minor**: Some lengthy sentences could be split for modern readers' comfort, but contribute to the period feel.
	* **Score: 4.5/5** (Generally clear, with stylistic justification for complexity)
5. **Flow**:
	* **None Noted**: Transitions between scenes and chapters are well-managed.
	* **Score: 5/5**

**FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5**
