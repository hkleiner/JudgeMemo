### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - **None notable**; sentences are well-constructed.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **None notable**; text appears error-free in this regard.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - Occasionally **formal vocabulary** might hinder smooth reading for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sacramental use", "invisibly bestows").
   - **Effective** in conveying complex theological concepts.

4. **Phrasing**:
   - Some **long, complex sentences** could be broken down for better flow (e.g., the paragraph starting with "The Articles.â€”There are seven Articles...").
   - Generally, phrasing is **clear and concise**.

5. **Flow**:
   - **Transitions between paragraphs** are mostly smooth, guiding the reader through the argument.
   - **Occasional abrupt shifts** in focus (e.g., from discussing Scripture to the Church of England's documents without a clear connector).

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - **Generally logical**, with a clear introduction, setup of the problem, and progression into the analysis.
   - **One notable jump**: The transition from the introductory chapter to diving deep into "The Real Presence" could be more clearly signaled.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - **Some repetition** in emphasizing the distinction between the Church of England's teachings and others (could be condensed for efficiency).
   - **Repetition serves clarity** in complex theological distinctions.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - **Mostly achieved** through transitional phrases and clear topic sentences.
   - **Room for improvement** in connecting the final paragraph of Chapter I back to the overarching objective more explicitly.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - **Generally clear**, with complex concepts broken down.
   - **Potential ambiguity** for readers unfamiliar with theological terminology (e.g., "the real objective presence" could benefit from a brief explanation for non-experts).

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - **Consistent in format** (Chapter headings, paragraph structure).
   - **Depth of analysis varies**; some sections are more in-depth than others, which might slightly disrupt the narrative balance.
