### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - Occasional complex sentence structures may hinder immediate clarity.
   - A few instances of sentence fragments or incomplete thoughts (e.g., "But as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing." could be clearer).

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - **"antldiluvians"** (likely "antideluvians" or "antediluvians").
   - **"admirirg"** (should be "admiring").
   - **"dimentions"** (should be "dimensions").
   - **"scientest"** (should be "scientist").
   - **"Bridtish"** (should be "British").
   - **"consitutes"** (should be "constitutes").
   - **"hightest"** (should be "highest").
   - **"jageed"** (unclear/intended meaning? Possibly "jagged").
   - Missing or inconsistent commas in lists and for clarity.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - Occasionally verbose (e.g., "veritable Garden of Eden" is poetic but repetitive).
   - Archaic or less common vocabulary might alienate some readers (e.g., "antideluvians", "euphony").

4. **Phrasing**:
   - Some phrases are awkwardly worded (e.g., "at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large").
   - Transitions between poetic description and factual information can be abrupt.

5. **Flow**:
   - The text jumps between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, geographical description, and promotional tone, which can disrupt flow.
   - Lengthy paragraphs overwhelm the reader.

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - Transitions between ideas (biblical context, personal discovery, geographical details) could be smoother.
   - The narrative leaps from describing the garden's features to discussing its inhabitants' characteristics without clear connection.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - The uniqueness and beauty of the location are repeatedly emphasized without adding new insights.
   - "Garden of Eden" and its verification are mentioned multiple times with similar arguments.
