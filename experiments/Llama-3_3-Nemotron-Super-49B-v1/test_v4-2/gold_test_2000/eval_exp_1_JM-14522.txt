### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* **None notable**; overall grammatically correct.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **None notable**; appears error-free.
3. **Word Choice**:
	* Occasionally **archaic vocabulary** might hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "whilst" not used but "receptive expectations" and other phrases).
4. **Phrasing**:
	* Some **long, complex sentences** may disrupt flow (e.g., the description of Mrs. Umney's warning).
	* **Effective use of varied sentence structure** otherwise.
5. **Flow**:
	* **Generally smooth transitions** between scenes and ideas.
	* **One abrupt transition**: From the family's discussion at supper to Mr. Otis being awakened by a noise (could be more seamlessly connected).

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **Well-structured narrative**; events follow logically.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **The re-appearance of the blood stain** is repetitive but **used effectively for narrative build-up**.
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Most transitions are smooth**, but see Fluency's Flow for one exception.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Generally clear**, but **motivations behind character actions** (e.g., Mr. Otis's immediate solution for the ghost) could be more explicitly stated for clarity.
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Consistent in narrative style and structure** throughout.

### **FINAL SCORES**

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
*Rationale: The narrative is well-structured, logical, and mostly clear, with effective use of repetitive elements for build-up. The only deductions are for a minor abrupt transition and slightly implicit character motivations.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
*Rationale: The text excels in grammar, spelling, and overall flow, with engaging varied sentence structures. Deductions are for the potential hindrance of archaic vocabulary to modern readers and one notable abrupt transition.*
