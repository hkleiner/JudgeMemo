**Fluency Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints)**

* **Syntax and Grammar**: 
	+ Generally strong, with complex sentences well-constructed.
	+ **Minor Issue**: A few sentences are overly long, potentially causing slight confusion (e.g., the paragraph describing Jasper's opium use and its implications).
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: 
	+ No noticeable errors.
* **Word Choice**: 
	+ Appropriate and contributes to a smooth reading experience.
	+ **Minor Quibble**: Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "gamin", "fianc√©e" might slow some readers, but context usually clarifies).
* **Phrasing**: 
	+ Mostly well-structured.
	+ **Occasional Awkwardness**: Phrases like "the bloom is off the plum of their prearranged loves" might benefit from rephrasing for modern clarity.
* **Flow**: 
	+ Generally smooth transitions between sentences.
	+ **Notable Issue**: The transition from the introduction to "CHAPTER: THE STORY" feels somewhat abrupt, lacking a clear connector.

**Coherence Evaluation with Main Issues (Bulletpoints)**

* **Logical Sequencing**: 
	+ Ideas are mostly presented in a logical order.
	+ **Minor Issue**: The shift from analyzing Dickens's approach to diving into the story's characters feels a bit disjointed.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: 
	+ No significant unnecessary repetition.
* **Smooth Connections**: 
	+ **Issue**: Transitions between different character introductions and scene settings could be smoother (e.g., from Jasper's opium den to Cloisterham without clear temporal or spatial connectors).
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: 
	+ **Notable Issue**: The text assumes a strong prior knowledge of Dickens's works and historical context, which might confuse unfamiliar readers (e.g., references to "The Signalman" without brief context).
* **Structural Consistency**: 
	+ The narrative structure is clear and consistent within its analytical and storytelling parts.
	+ **Minor Quibble**: The mix of analysis and storytelling might confuse readers regarding the text's primary focus.

**FINAL Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
*Rationale: Despite some minor issues with transitions and assuming prior knowledge, the text's logical flow and structural consistency are strong.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
*Rationale: With only minor grievances regarding sentence length, occasional phrasing, and one notable
