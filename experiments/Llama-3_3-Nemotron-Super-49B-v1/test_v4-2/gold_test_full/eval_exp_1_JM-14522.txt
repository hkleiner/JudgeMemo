### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints (by Aspect)**

1. **Logical Sequencing**
	* **Well-structured narrative**; events follow logically.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**
	* **Some repetitive elements** in the ghost's attempts to scare (could be seen as thematic consistency rather than a flaw).
3. **Smooth Connections**
	* **Generally smooth**, though the transition to **Chapter V** (Virginia's encounter) might feel slightly abrupt to some.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**
	* **Minor ambiguity** in the exact nature of the ghost's final moments and Virginia's experience (intentional for emotional impact).
5. **Structural Consistency**
	* **Consistent in narrative voice and style** throughout.
	* **Thematic consistency** in exploring the contrast between American pragmatism and British tradition, as well as the power of innocence and compassion.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** **4.5** (Rounded to **5** for the final score, as the minor issues do not significantly detract from the overall coherence)
