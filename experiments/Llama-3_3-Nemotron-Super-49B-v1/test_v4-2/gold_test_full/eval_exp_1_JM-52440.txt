### **Fluency Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
	* **Minor Issue**: Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity, but overall grammar is sound.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
	* **No Major Issues**: Text appears free from noticeable spelling or punctuation errors.
3. **Word Choice**:
	* **Generally Appropriate**: Vocabulary is formal and suitable for the theological and historical context. However, some archaic terms (e.g., "thou", "thee") might slightly hinder modern readers' flow.
4. **Phrasing**:
	* **Occasional Clunkiness**: A few phrases are wordy or could be more concise for better flow (e.g., lengthy introductory phrases to quotes).
5. **Flow**:
	* **Transitions Could Improve**: Chapter and section transitions are clear, but within sections, the flow between paragraphs could be smoother with more transitional phrases.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**

### **Coherence Evaluation**

**Main Issues in Bulletpoints by Aspect:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
	* **Well-Structured**: The text logically progresses from introduction through themed chapters (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice).
2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
	* **Some Redundancy**: Key points (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified) are repeated for emphasis, which, while helpful for clarity, slightly reduces conciseness.
3. **Smooth Connections**:
	* **Generally Smooth**: Clear connections between ideas, with minor exceptions where transitions between paragraphs could be enhanced.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
	* **Clear Definitions**: Technical and theological terms are well-defined, reducing ambiguity. However, the assumption of prior knowledge in some areas (e.g., specific historical theological debates) might leave some readers unclear.
5. **Structural Consistency**:
	* **Consistent**: The narrative and argument are consistently structured throughout, enhancing overall coherence.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5** (Rounded to **5** for the final score, as the scoring system does not accommodate decimals)
