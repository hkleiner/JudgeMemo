Issues:
* **Minor Repetitions**: Some descriptive phrases (e.g., character appearances, settings) are repeated nearly verbatim in different chapters without significant variation.
* **Pacing Variability**: The narrative pace fluctuates notably, with some chapters feeling rushed (e.g., the resolution in Chapter VII) and others more leisurely (e.g., the ghost's backstory in Chapter II).
* **Character Depth (Supporting)**: While the Otis family and the ghost are well-defined, supporting characters (e.g., the Duke of Cheshire, Mrs. Umney) could benefit from deeper development to enhance their impact.
* **Tone Consistency**: The balance between humor, horror, and sentimentality is mostly well-handled, but a few transitions between these tones feel slightly abrupt.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
