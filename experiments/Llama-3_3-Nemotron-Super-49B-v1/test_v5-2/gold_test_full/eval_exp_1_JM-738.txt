Issues:
* The text is overly verbose and dense, making it challenging to follow the narrative and analysis.
* The structure is non-linear, jumping between story summary, character analysis, theory discussions, and authorial intentions, which disrupts coherence.
* Excessive use of quotes and references (e.g., to Forster, Mr. Proctor, Mr. Cuming Walters) without clear integration into the main argument, causing fluency issues.
* The transition between discussing the story and evaluating its coherence/fluidity is abrupt and unclear.
* Some paragraphs are too long and dense, lacking clear topic sentences or transitions.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
*Rationale: The text's coherence is compromised by its non-linear structure, excessive verbosity, and the challenging integration of various elements (story, theories, references). However, the core argument about the mystery's solution is discernible with close reading.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
*Rationale: Fluency is significantly impacted by the dense, overly complex writing style, excessive quoting, and lack of clear transitions between ideas, making the text difficult to read smoothly.*
