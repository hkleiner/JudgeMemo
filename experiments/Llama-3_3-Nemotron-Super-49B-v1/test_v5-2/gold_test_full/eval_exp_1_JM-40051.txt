Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The text frequently jumps between biblical interpretation, geographical description, personal anecdote, and defensive argumentation, disrupting the narrative flow.
	+ Overly lengthy and repetitive descriptions of the landscape, which, while vivid, detract from the central argument's clarity.
	+ Lack of a clear, structured progression from introducing the claim to supporting it with biblical and geographical evidence.
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Grammar & Spelling:** Generally good, with minor errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "utilized" instead of a more fitting word in some contexts).
	+ **Word Choice & Phrasing:** Sometimes overly formal or archaic ("whilst", "methinks", "veritable"), which may alienate some readers. Phrasing can be cumbersome.
	+ **Punctuation:** Effective use, though some sentences are excessively long and could benefit from division for better flow.
