Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ Abrupt transitions between biblical analysis, geographical description, and personal anecdotes (e.g., the sudden shift to George Stransom's story, unrelated to the Garden of Eden narrative)
	+ Lack of clear structure; the narrative jumps between proving the garden's location, describing its beauty, and discussing unrelated topics (e.g., Lewis's speech, the story about killing the landlord)
	+ Overly defensive tone against potential critics detracts from the narrative flow
	+ Inconsistent depth of detail (e.g., extensive descriptions of the landscape vs. brief, unclear references to other topics)
* **Fluency:**
	+ Archaic language and phrasing ("thou", "thee", "veritable") may hinder modern readers' understanding
	+ Repetitive phrasing ("Come and see!") becomes redundant
	+ Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, impairing clarity
	+ Spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "commencing more than half way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top" could be clearer)

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
