Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The story is overly complex with too many characters and plot threads, making it difficult to follow at times.
	+ The transition between the "Introduction" and "The Story" chapters feels abrupt, disrupting the narrative flow.
	+ The inclusion of Forster's evidence and various theories (Mr. Proctor's, Mr. Cuming Walters's) within the narrative disrupts the coherence of the story itself, feeling more like analytical commentary.
	+ The ending is highly speculative, relying on unresolved theories rather than a conclusive narrative.
* **Fluency:**
	+ The writing style often shifts between formal, analytical tones (e.g., discussing literary critiques and theories) and narrative tones, causing inconsistency.
	+ Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading.
	+ The text includes apparent non-sequiturs (e.g., the passage about Millet's art, the discussion on Scripture inspiration) that disrupt the flow.
	+ Character introductions and backstories are sometimes clumsily integrated into the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
