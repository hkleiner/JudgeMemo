Issues:
* **Minor Repetitions**: Some descriptive phrases (e.g., character introductions, settings) are repeated almost verbatim in different chapters, slightly disrupting the narrative flow.
* **Pacing Variability**: Chapters vary significantly in length and pacing, with some (like Chapter V) being highly intense and others (like parts of Chapter IV) feeling somewhat dragged out or filled with less critical content.
* **Character Depth (Supporting)**: While the main characters are well-defined, some supporting characters (e.g., the twins, beyond their mischief) could benefit from deeper development to enhance emotional investment.
* **Transition Between Chapters**: Occasionally, the transition from one chapter to the next feels somewhat abrupt, lacking a smooth narrative bridge.
