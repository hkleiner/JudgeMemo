Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The text is overly lengthy and repetitive, making it hard to follow the central argument.
	+ Transitions between sections are abrupt, lacking smooth connectivity.
	+ The narrative frequently diverges into unrelated topics (e.g., discussions on cyclones, specific farming yields) that disrupt the flow.
	+ The author assumes a deep prior knowledge of the Bible and geography, which might confuse some readers.
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Grammar and Spelling:** Generally good, but with occasional errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "diminentional").
	+ **Word Choice and Phrasing:** Often overly formal and verbose, hindering readability.
	+ **Punctuation:** Effective overall, but could benefit from more strategic use to enhance clarity in lengthy sentences.
	+ **Syntax:** Complex sentences are common, sometimes leading to confusion.
