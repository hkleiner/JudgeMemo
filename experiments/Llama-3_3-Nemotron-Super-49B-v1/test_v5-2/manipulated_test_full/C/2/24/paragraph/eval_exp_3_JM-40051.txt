Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The text frequently jumps between biblical interpretation, geographical description, personal anecdote, and defensive argumentation, disrupting the narrative flow.
	+ Overly lengthy and repetitive descriptions of the landscape, which, while vivid, detract from the overall coherence and focus of the "Garden of Eden" claim.
	+ Lack of a clear, structured argument to convincingly link the described location to the biblical Garden of Eden beyond speculative similarities.
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Grammar and Spelling:** Generally good, with minor, occasional errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "utilized" instead of a more fitting word in some contexts).
	+ **Syntax and Word Choice:** Sometimes convoluted sentences and overly complex phrasing hinder smooth reading (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place").
	+ **Punctuation:** Effective use, though some sentences are very long and could benefit from division for better flow.
