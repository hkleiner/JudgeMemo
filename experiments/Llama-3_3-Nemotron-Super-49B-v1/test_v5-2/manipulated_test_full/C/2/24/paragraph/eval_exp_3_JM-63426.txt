Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The story is highly fragmented, with multiple chapters and time jumps, making it challenging to follow a linear narrative.
	+ Transitions between chapters and time periods are often abrupt.
	+ The mix of biographical, reflective, and descriptive sections sometimes disrupts the flow.
	+ Some sections (e.g., the detailed chronology, afterword) feel tacked on rather than integrated.
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Strengths:** Engaging, descriptive language; vivid portrayal of historical settings and the protagonist's emotions.
	+ **Weaknesses:**
		- Overly complex sentence structures in some areas.
		- Repetitive mentions of specific typefaces (e.g., Caslon) without initial clear context for non-experts.
		- Sudden, unexplained shifts in narrative voice (first-person to second-person in some sections).
		- Technical jargon (printing, typography) may alienate non-specialist readers without clarification.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
(Rationale: While the story has interesting content, its disjointed structure and lack of smooth transitions significantly impact its overall coherence.)

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
(Rationale: Despite some complexity and jargon, the narrative is generally engaging, with strong descriptive elements, outweighing its fluency issues.)
