Issues:
* **Coherence**: The story is overly complex with multiple unresolved plot threads (e.g., the fate of Edwin Drood, the identity of Datchery) and lacks a clear narrative progression. The numerous theories and interpretations within the text itself confuse the overall coherence.
* **Fluency**: The writing is dense and often cumbersome, with excessive detail that slows the narrative pace. The inclusion of various theories and critiques within the story disrupts the flow, making it challenging to follow as a cohesive narrative.
* **Character Development**: Characters like Datchery and the Princess Puffer are introduced without clear resolution or integration into the main plot, causing narrative distractions.
* **Pacing**: The story meanders through analyses of potential endings and character identities, severely impacting the narrative's forward momentum.

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
