Issues: 
* The text contains several abrupt, unrelated phrases (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched.", "The energy grid remained balanced.", "A camera lens refocused itself.", etc.) that disrupt the narrative flow and coherence.
* The structure, while largely coherent in its argumentative flow, could benefit from clearer transitions between chapters and subtopics to enhance readability.
* Some paragraphs are excessively long, which may hinder the reader's ability to follow the intricate theological arguments without a break.
* The inclusion of direct quotes and references (e.g., from Dr. Pusey, Homilies) without initial context might confuse readers unfamiliar with the sources.
