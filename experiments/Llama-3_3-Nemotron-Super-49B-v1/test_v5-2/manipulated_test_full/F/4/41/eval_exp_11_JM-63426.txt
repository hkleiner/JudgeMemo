Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The story is highly fragmented, with multiple chapters and timelines that don't always flow smoothly into one another.
	+ Transitions between chapters (e.g., from "THE GAY NINETIES" to "SPRINGFIELD: THE WAYSIDE PRESS") could be more cohesive.
	+ Some sections (e.g., "THE MAGAZINE WORLD--AN INTERPOLATION") feel like informational inserts rather than integral narrative parts.
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Typos and Minor Errors:** Numerous typos (e.g., "AN INTEODUCTION", "ghe", "dtartling", "tlvwhich", "experkence") detract from the reading experience.
	+ **Sentence Structure:** While mostly clear, some sentences are overly long or convoluted, affecting readability.
	+ **Consistency:** Inconsistent use of formatting (e.g., quotation marks, spacing) and occasional shifts in narrative voice (first to second person in some chapters).

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
