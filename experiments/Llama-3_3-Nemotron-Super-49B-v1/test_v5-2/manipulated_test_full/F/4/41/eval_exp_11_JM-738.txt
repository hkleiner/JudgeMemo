Issues:
* The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow the narrative and analysis.
* The writing style often veers between formal academic tone and informal, speculative language (e.g., "I think," "it seems to me"), which can disrupt the reader's engagement.
* Numerous theories and counter-theories are presented without clear sectioning or visual differentiation, leading to confusion.
* Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence or concluding thought, causing disjointedness.
* The incorporation of external evidence (e.g., Forster's account, Collins's drawings) is valuable but could be more seamlessly integrated into the main argument.
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens, his works, and the context of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," which might alienate less familiar readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
*Rationale: While the text explores the mystery with depth and utilizes relevant evidence, its coherence is compromised by its unwieldy length, lack of clear structuring, and the informal-speculative tone interspersed with academic analysis.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
*Rationale: The text's fluency is hindered by its dense, overly complex sentences, the abrupt shifting between different tones, and the overall lack of clarity in presentation, making it a challenging read.*
