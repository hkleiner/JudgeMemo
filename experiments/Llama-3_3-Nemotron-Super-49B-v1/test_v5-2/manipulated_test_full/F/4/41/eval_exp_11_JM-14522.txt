Issues:
* **Minor inconsistencies in character descriptions**: Washington Otis's age and maturity level seem inconsistent (e.g., leading the German at the Newport Casino vs. being outwitted by the ghost).
* **Predictable plot twists**: The ghost's eventual demise and Virginia's role in it, while charming, are somewhat foreseeable.
* **Overly convenient coincidences**: The timing and nature of the ghost's final appearance with Virginia feel a bit contrived.
* **Some anachronistic elements and unresolved subplots**: (e.g., the significance of the almond tree blossoming is poetic but not fully integrated; the young Duke's backstory and the Marchioness of Dumbleton's subplot are underdeveloped).
* **Occasional info dumping**: Detailed descriptions of the ghost's past exploits, while entertaining, sometimes slow the narrative pace.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
