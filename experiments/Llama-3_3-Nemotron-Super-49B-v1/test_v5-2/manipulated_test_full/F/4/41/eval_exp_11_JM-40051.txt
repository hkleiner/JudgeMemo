Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The text frequently jumps between biblical interpretation, geographical description, personal anecdote, and defensive argumentation, disrupting the narrative flow.
	+ Overly lengthy and repetitive descriptions of the landscape, which, while vivid, detract from the overall coherence and focus of the central claim.
	+ Lack of a clear, structured argument to convincingly link the described location to the Garden of Eden, relying heavily on assertion rather than systematic evidence.
* **Fluency:**
	+ Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "tje", "antldiluvians", "discription", "envirnment"), spelling mistakes, and punctuation inconsistencies.
	+ Word choice and phrasing are often awkward or overly formal, hindering smooth reading (e.g., "sensibly impressed by a suggestion", "my power of adequate description").
	+ Sentence structure varies greatly, with both very long, convoluted sentences and short, abrupt ones, affecting overall fluency.
