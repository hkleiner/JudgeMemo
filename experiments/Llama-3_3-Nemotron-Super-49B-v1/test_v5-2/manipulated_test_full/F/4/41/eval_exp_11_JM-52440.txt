Issues: 
* The text is overly verbose and dense, making it challenging to follow at times due to excessive length of sentences and paragraphs.
* Repetitive explanations and justifications slow down the narrative and could be condensed for better flow.
* The transition between chapters and topics (e.g., from Real Presence to Adoration to Sacrifice) could be smoother with clearer sectioning or introductory sentences.
* Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, burying the main point.
* Archaisms and outdated language (e.g., "thou", "thee") in quoted material are not contextualized for modern readers, potentially causing confusion.
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's history and doctrines, which might alienate less informed readers.
