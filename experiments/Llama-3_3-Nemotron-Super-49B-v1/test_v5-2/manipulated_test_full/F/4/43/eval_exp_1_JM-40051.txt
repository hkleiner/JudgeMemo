Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The text frequently jumps between topics (e.g., from describing the garden to discussing geological age, then to dairy farming, and biblical interpretations) without smooth transitions.
	+ Repetitive assertions of the garden's beauty and claims without clear, logical progression of evidence.
	+ Lack of clear structure; the narrative, descriptive, and argumentative parts are not well-integrated.
	+ Ambiguities in connecting the described location with the Biblical Garden of Eden beyond superficial similarities.
* **Fluency:**
	+ Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, punctuation issues).
	+ Word choice and phrasing are often awkward (e.g., "morning was the first day" should be "the evening and the morning were the first day").
	+ Overuse of commas leading to confusing sentence structures.
	+ Archaic language and tone may hinder modern readability.
