Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The story is highly fragmented, with abrupt transitions between chapters and topics.
	+ Lack of clear chronological flow in some sections (e.g., jumping between different periods of the protagonist's life without clear connectors).
	+ Some paragraphs seem disconnected from the main narrative (e.g., detailed descriptions of historical settings or side characters without clear relevance).
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Grammar & Spelling:** Mostly error-free, indicating strong technical writing skills.
	+ **Word Choice & Phrasing:** Often verbose; overly complex sentences and word choices may hinder readability for some readers.
	+ **Punctuation:** Effective use, though some long sentences could benefit from additional punctuation for clarity.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
(Rationale: While the story has a general narrative arc, the fragmentation and lack of smooth transitions between ideas deduct from its overall coherence.)

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
(Rationale: High technical proficiency in grammar and punctuation, but deducts for verbosity and complexity that may impact readability.)
