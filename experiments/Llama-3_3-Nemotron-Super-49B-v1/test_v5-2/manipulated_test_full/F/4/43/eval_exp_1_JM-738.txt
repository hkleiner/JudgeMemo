Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The story is overly complex with too many characters and plot threads, making it difficult to follow at times.
	+ The transition between the introduction (literary analysis of Dickens) and the actual story is abrupt and disrupts the narrative flow.
	+ Some plot points (e.g., the significance of the opium hag's identity, Jasper's backstory) are hinted at but not fully developed or resolved.
* **Fluency:**
	+ The writing style often feels archaic (likely due to the subject matter and emulation of Dickens' era), which may hinder modern readers' fluency.
	+ There are instances of unclear or overly complex sentence structures.
	+ The text includes apparent typos ("babblings, half revealed, concealed Jasper one points" appears to be a corrupted sentence).

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
