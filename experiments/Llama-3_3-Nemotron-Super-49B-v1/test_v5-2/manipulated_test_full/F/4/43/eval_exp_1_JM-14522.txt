Issues:
* **Minor inconsistencies in character descriptions**: Washington Otis's character seems somewhat inconsistent in his reactions (e.g., from bravado with the ghost to more thoughtful moments).
* **Pacing issues in later chapters**: The narrative pace slows significantly in Chapters IV through VII, with some scenes feeling less impactful or necessary for the overall plot progression.
* **Somewhat predictable resolution**: The ultimate fate of the ghost and Virginia's involvement, while emotionally satisfying, is somewhat foreshadowed and lacks a major twist.
* **Occasional info dumping**: Brief moments where backstory or character history feels forced or overly detailed without significant contribution to the immediate narrative.
* **Fluency:**
  * **Archaisms and modern language mix**: The blend of archaic (fitting for the setting) and modern American dialogue sometimes feels jarring.
  * **Sentence structure variability**: While mostly engaging, there are shifts between highly descriptive, lengthy sentences and very short, simple ones, affecting flow.
  * **Repetition of descriptive elements**: Certain descriptive phrases or elements (e.g., the ghost's appearance, settings) are repeated nearly verbatim, which could be varied for better fluency.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
