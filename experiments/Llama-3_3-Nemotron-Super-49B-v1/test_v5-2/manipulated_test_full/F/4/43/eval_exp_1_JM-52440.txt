Issues:
* The text is overly verbose and dense, making it challenging to follow at times due to excessive length and complex sentence structures.
* Repetitive explanations and justifications slow down the narrative and could be condensed for better flow.
* The transition between chapters and topics (e.g., from Real Presence to Adoration to Sacrifice) could be smoother with clearer sectioning or introductory sentences.
* Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, burying the main point beneath detailed analysis.
* The inclusion of direct quotes from various sources (e.g., Dr. Pusey, Homilies) without immediate contextualization can disrupt the reader's flow.
