Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The text frequently jumps between biblical interpretation, geographical description, personal anecdote, and defensive argumentation, disrupting the narrative flow.
	+ Overly lengthy and repetitive descriptions of the landscape, which, while vivid, detract from the central argument's clarity.
	+ Lack of a clear, structured progression from introducing the discovery to convincing the reader of its validity.
* **Fluency:**
	+ Archaic language and sentence structures (e.g., "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me") that may hinder modern readers' comprehension.
	+ Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "commenced developing the facts about it" without clear subject-verb agreement).
	+ Inconsistent use of formatting (e.g., sudden italicization without clear purpose, inconsistent spacing).

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
