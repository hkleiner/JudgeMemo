Issues:
* **Coherence**: The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow the narrative thread. The extensive analysis of theories and the inclusion of multiple critics' opinions disrupt the flow, causing confusion. Key plot points and the author's intended resolution are obscured by the sheer volume of speculative discussion.
* **Fluency**: The writing often veers between formal academic critique and speculative fiction analysis, leading to an inconsistent tone. Archaic language usage (e.g., "whilst", "thou") and overly complex sentence structures impede smooth reading. The text could benefit from clearer sectioning and summaries to enhance readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
