Issues:
* **Minor Repetitions**: Some descriptive phrases (e.g., character appearances, settings) are repeated nearly verbatim in different chapters without significant variation.
* **Pacing Variability**: The narrative pace fluctuates notably, with some chapters feeling rushed (e.g., the resolution in Chapter VII) and others overly detailed (e.g., the ghost's backstory in Chapter II).
* **Character Depth (Supporting)**: While the main characters are well-defined, some supporting characters (e.g., the twins, beyond their mischief) lack depth.
* **Predictability**: The ultimate resolution (Virginia's interaction with the ghost leading to its peace) becomes somewhat predictable after the midpoint.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
