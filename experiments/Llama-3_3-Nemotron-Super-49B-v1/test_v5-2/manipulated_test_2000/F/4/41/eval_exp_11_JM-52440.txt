Issues:
* **Minor typos and spelling errors** (e.g., "unvommon", "srrvice", "prssent", "wnd", "tue", "vby", "myn", "lt", "teh", "invisibly bestows the invisible gift on tye soul" should be "on the soul")
* **Occasional awkward phrasing** (e.g., "the great point to be determined" could be more fluidly integrated)
* **Lengthy, dense paragraphs** which may impede smooth reading flow
* **Assumes prior knowledge of specific religious texts and doctrines** without brief contextualization for broader understanding
* **Transitional phrases between ideas could be stronger** for enhanced coherence

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
