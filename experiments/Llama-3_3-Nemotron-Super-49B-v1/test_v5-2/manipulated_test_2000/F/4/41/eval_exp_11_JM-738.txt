Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ The narrative frequently shifts between analysis of Dickens's work and the retelling of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a clear, smooth transition, causing slight confusion.
	+ Some paragraphs feel overly dense with character introductions and backstory, potentially overwhelming the reader.
	+ The abrupt end of the provided chapter ("SAPSEA AND DURDLES") without a clear section break or conclusion disrupts the narrative flow.
* **Fluency**:
	+ **Typos and Minor Errors**: Numerous typos (e.g., "deserfed", "ajd", "oeft", "apopldxy", "notvout", "therectwo", "fromcthe", "maicen", "tjis", "svholar", "giod", "bettothal", " Minor Canon Crisparkle's introduction lacks a space) detract from the reading experience.
	+ **Word Choice/Clarity**: A few phrases are worded ambiguously (e.g., "the bloom is off the plum of their prearranged loves") or use less common vocabulary without clear context ("gamin"), which might confuse some readers.
	+ **Pacing**: The detailed character analyses and historical/contextual information sometimes slow the pace of the story's unfolding.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
