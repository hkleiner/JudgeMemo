Issues:
* Minor typos and spelling errors (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "srripes", "vety", "tuey", "reavhed", "Yhe", "evwrything", "librwry", "Myerw", "obpong", "anmold", "rhe", "whxt")
* Some sentences are overly long and could be broken up for better flow
* A few instances of slightly archaic language might confuse modern readers (though this could be intentional for the story's tone)
* The transition between Chapter I and II could be smoother
* The character of Mrs. Umney's fainting and recovery feels a bit abrupt
