Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION and CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING (lack of clear narrative bridge)
	+ Some sections in "THE BOY PRINTER" feel overly detailed (e.g., food descriptions) without clear relevance to the overarching narrative of Will Bradley's impact or career development
	+ The story ends abruptly in the middle of a scene (with Mr. Newett and the faker) without resolution or connection back to the introduction's themes
* **Fluency**:
	+ Minor spelling and punctuation errors (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "werebknown", "therecderivative", "qant", "esucation", missing articles and inconsistent comma usage)
	+ Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, hindering smooth reading flow
	+ Inconsistent narrative voice/tone, particularly in the shift from the introductory chapter to the more juvenile tone in "THE BOY PRINTER"

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
