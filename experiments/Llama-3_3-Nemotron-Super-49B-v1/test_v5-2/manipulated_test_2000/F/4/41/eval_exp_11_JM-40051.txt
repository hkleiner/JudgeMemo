Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery narrative (e.g., the shift from discussing God's placement of man to the author's personal realization).
	+ Lack of clear, logical connection between some paragraphs (e.g., the jump from describing the garden's location to discussing the greed of original proprietors).
	+ Repetitive emphasis on the garden's beauty without clear progression in the argument.
	+ Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge (e.g., references to "the North West" without explanation).
* **Fluency**:
	+ Archaic language and phrasing (e.g., "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it") that may hinder modern readability.
	+ Inconsistent spacing and formatting (noted in the text's presentation, though possibly an artifact of transcription).
	+ Minor spelling and typographical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "princopak", "cohsequently", "admirirg", "prlper", "inhabitant of all the earth" should likely be "inhabitants").
	+ Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., the sentence beginning "Since I commenced to publish my views...").
