Issues:
* **Grammar and Spelling Errors**: Numerous instances (e.g., "every one tell" should be "everyone told", "am see" should be "has been seen", "was removed at once" should be "to be removed at once", "woulded did it" is incorrect, "woedn't" should be "wouldn't", "is extremely upset" should be "was extremely upset", "had seen things with my own eyes" is correctly used but followed by incorrect subject-verb agreement in "would make any Christian's hair stood on end" which should be "would make any Christian's hair stand on end").
* **Tense Consistency**: Shifts in tense (e.g., "had seen" to "say" without clear narrative justification, "was" in descriptions where consistency with the past tense of the story is needed).
* **Word Choice/Phrasing**: A few phrasings feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading tastes (though this might be intentional for a period piece), and some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "am his only weaknesses" should be "are his only weaknesses").
* **Coherence - Character Introduction**: The introduction of characters (especially the twins) feels somewhat abrupt and lacking in depth compared to others.
* **Coherence - Plot Flow**: The transition from Chapter I to II and the escalation of ghostly events could be smoother, with more build-up or foreshadowing for the ghost's appearance in Chapter II.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
