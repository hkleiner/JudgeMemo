Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 (from discussing Will Bradley's impact to his childhood without a clear connecting sentence or paragraph).
	+ Chapter 2 meanders through various childhood anecdotes without an overt narrative arc or clear relevance to Bradley's later work beyond the initial printing press interest.
	+ The story about the faker at the end of Chapter 2 feels disconnected from the rest of Bradley's biography presented in the chapter.
* **Fluency**:
	+ Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "It shoulded be", "was know", "donâ€™t worked", "was thrilled", "was found", "are went", "was to get", "was learned", "are went home", "was operated", "was got").
	+ Inconsistent verb tenses throughout both chapters.
	+ Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, hindering smooth reading (e.g., the paragraph describing European artistic movements).

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
