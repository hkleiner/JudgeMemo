Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ Abrupt transitions between biblical context, personal discovery, and geographical description (e.g., the shift from discussing the Bible to describing the author's location without clear connectors).
	+ Assumptions of shared knowledge (e.g., the significance of "Havilah" or the comparison to Yosemite without explanation for potentially unfamiliar readers).
	+ Circular reasoning in arguing the garden's location (e.g., using the garden's characteristics to prove it's Eden, without independent verification).
	+ Lack of clear structure; the narrative jumps between different aspects of the garden (historical, geographical, personal) without a cohesive flow.
* **Fluency:**
	+ Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "had venture to published", "I is ignorant", "woulded have been").
	+ Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., switching between past and present tense within the same paragraph).
	+ Awkward phrasing and word choice (e.g., "sensibly impressed by a suggestion", "not too far north, not too far south" without clear connection to the preceding text).
	+ Overly complex sentences hindering clarity (e.g., the description of the garden's layout and features).
