Issues:
* **Repetitive phrasing** (e.g., "it is" at the beginning of multiple sentences, repetitive explanations of the same concept)
* **Archaic language and spelling** (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in some places, "am" instead of "are", "beared" instead of "bear", "whomsoever" - while stylistic, may affect modern readability)
* **Lengthy, complex sentences** (impacting readability and flow)
* **Abrupt transition** from discussing the importance of the Church's voice to diving into specific Articles without a clear connecting sentence
* **Minor grammatical errors** (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are", "beared" instead of "bear")
