Issues:
* **Coherence:**
	+ The narrative frequently shifts between analysis of Dickens's work and the retelling of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a clear, smooth transition, causing slight disjointedness.
	+ Some character introductions (e.g., Minor Canon Crisparkle, Sapsea, Durdles) feel abrupt or lack immediate contextual relevance to the main plot mystery.
	+ The inclusion of external references (e.g., Scott, Wilkie Collins, Gaboriau, Lord Lytton) while informative, sometimes disrupts the flow focused on "Edwin Drood".
* **Fluency:**
	+ **Grammar/Spelling:** Numerous instances of incorrect verb conjugation (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "was"), missing articles, and punctuation errors (e.g., missing commas, incorrect use of quotation marks).
	+ **Word Choice/Phrasing:** Occasionally, word choices are overly formal or archaic for modern reading comfort (e.g., "am a victim to the habit", "unlooked-for sallies"), and some sentences are overly complex or convoluted.
	+ **Punctuation for Clarity:** Lack of commas in lists and before conjunctions in complex sentences hinders readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
