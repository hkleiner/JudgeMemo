Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery narrative (e.g., the shift from discussing God's creation to the author's personal realization).
	+ Lack of clear, logical connection between some paragraphs (e.g., the jump from describing the garden's features to discussing the presence of rattlesnakes).
	+ Overly promotional tone at times, disrupting the narrative's objectivity.
	+ Repetitive emphasis on the garden's beauty without clear progression in the argument.
* **Fluency**:
	+ Archaic language and phrasing (e.g., "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it") that may hinder modern readability.
	+ Grammatical and punctuation errors (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had...") indicating a lack of proofreading.
	+ Wordy sentences and paragraphs, reducing overall readability (e.g., the lengthy description of the garden's scenery).
	+ Inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "Euphrates" and "Mississippi" are directly linked without clear justification at first mention).

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
