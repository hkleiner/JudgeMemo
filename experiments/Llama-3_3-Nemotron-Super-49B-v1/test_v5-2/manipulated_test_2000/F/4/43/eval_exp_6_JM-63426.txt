Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION and CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING (lacks a clear narrative bridge)
	+ In "THE BOY PRINTER", some scenes feel disconnected (e.g., the circus day and wanting to join, while charming, doesn’t clearly advance the narrative towards Bradley’s artistic development)
	+ The story jumps abruptly from Bradley's childhood ambitions to his work life without a smooth transition
	+ The inclusion of specific historical events (e.g., Theodore Roosevelt's libel trial) feels somewhat tangential to Bradley's personal story
* **Fluency**:
	+ Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the kind you place on a table and slap with the palm of your hand" could be more elegantly described)
	+ Repetitive sentence structures in "THE BOY PRINTER" (frequent use of simple past tense in successive short sentences)
	+ Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles or overly long sentences)
	+ Some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better flow (e.g., "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston.")

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
