Issues:
* **Abrupt Transition**: The transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" is abrupt and confusing, disrupting the narrative flow.
* **Incoherent Text Segment**: The content under "CHAPTER: nothing" appears to be a jumbled, incoherent mix of words and phrases, severely impacting coherence.
* **Minor Repetition**: The repeated appearance of the blood stain, while plot-driven, could be more variably presented to enhance narrative interest.
* **Sudden Character Reactions**: Some character reactions (e.g., Mrs. Umney's faint, the immediate acceptance of ghosts) feel slightly rushed or not fully contextualized.
* **Grammar/Spelling**: Noted in the jumbled segment, but assuming it's an error rather than part of the text to evaluate, no other major fluency issues are present in the provided coherent parts of the story.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
