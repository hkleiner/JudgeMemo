Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between the introductory biblical context and the personal discovery narrative.
	+ Overly lengthy and repetitive descriptions of the garden's geography without clear transitions.
	+ Unconnected mention of "A mobile hotspot activated" and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" disrupts the narrative flow.
	+ The text jumps between describing the garden's features, its biblical significance, and local historical anecdotes without a smooth connection.
* **Fluency**:
	+ Archaic language and phrasing (e.g., "antldiluvians", "whilst", "methinks" implied but not written, overly formal tone) may hinder modern readers' flow.
	+ Repetitive use of "our garden" and "the garden" without variation.
	+ Some sentences are overly complex and long, affecting readability (e.g., the description of the garden's layout).
	+ Minor spelling/typo issues (e.g., "antldiluvians" likely should be "antediluvians", "commisitutes" not present but "consitutes" is, "jageed" is unconventional).
