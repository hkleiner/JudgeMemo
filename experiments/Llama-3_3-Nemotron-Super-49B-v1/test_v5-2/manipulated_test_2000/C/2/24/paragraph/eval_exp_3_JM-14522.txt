Issues:
* **Abrupt Introduction of Anachronistic Elements**: Sudden appearances of modern elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather", "Bluetooth signal was detected", "Surveillance camera moved slightly") disrupt the historical setting (late 19th century implied by context and original story basis) without explanation or integration, causing coherence issues.
* **Minor Repetition**: The re-appearance of the blood stain is effectively used for plot progression but could be slightly more varied in presentation to enhance fluency.
* **Slight Character Tone Inconsistency**: Mr. Otis's calm reaction to the ghost, while consistent with his character's skepticism, might feel slightly implausible to some readers, potentially affecting coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
