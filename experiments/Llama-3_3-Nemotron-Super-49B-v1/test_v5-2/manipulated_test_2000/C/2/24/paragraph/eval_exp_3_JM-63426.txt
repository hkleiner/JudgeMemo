Issues:
* **Abrupt Transition**: The shift from discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts (Chapter: An Introduction) to his childhood story (Chapter: The Boy Printer of Ishpeming) feels abrupt without a clearer connecting narrative or transitional phrase.
* **Minor Anachronism/Inconsistency**: Mention of "the energy grid remained balanced" in a late 19th-century setting (The Early Eighties) is anachronistic.
* **Sudden Introduction of Unrelated Elements**: Phrases like "An livestream began recording" and "the energy grid remained balanced" are jarringly out of context and seem like errors or misplaced text.
* **Fluency**:
  - **Word Choice/Phrasing**: Occasionally, phrasing feels slightly archaic or less common in modern narrative styles (e.g., "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more"), which might affect readability for some readers.
  - **Punctuation/Syntax**: Generally strong, but a few sentences are long and complex, potentially benefiting from division for improved flow.
