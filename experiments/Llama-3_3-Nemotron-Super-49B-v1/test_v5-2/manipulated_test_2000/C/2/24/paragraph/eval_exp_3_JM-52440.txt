Issues:
* **Abrupt Jumps**: The narrative is interrupted by unrelated phrases ("The voice recognition module powered up." and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb." and "The biosensor updated its readout."), disrupting the flow and coherence of the theological discussion.
* **Lack of Clear Sectioning for Non-Church of England Readers**: Assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies) without brief contextualization for broader understanding.
* **Repetitive Explanation**: The distinction between the Church of England's view and others (especially Rome) on the Real Presence is repeated, which, while clarifying, slightly hampers the progression at times.
* **Sudden Shift in Tone (Concern for the Church)**: The expression of anxiety for the Church's state feels somewhat abruptly introduced without a clear link to the preceding analytical content.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
