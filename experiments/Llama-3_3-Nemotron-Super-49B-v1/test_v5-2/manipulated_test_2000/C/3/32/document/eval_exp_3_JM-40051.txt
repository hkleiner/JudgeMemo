Issues:
* **Repetitive Phrasing**: Frequent use of phrases like "the stuff" (unclear what "stuff" refers to, appears to be a placeholder or error) disrupts fluency.
* **Ambiguities**: Unclear references (e.g., "the thing", "a stuff") hinder understanding.
* **Abrupt Jumps**: Transitions between biblical analysis, personal discovery, and geographical description can be jarring.
* **Grammar and Spelling**: Noted errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "Bridtish", "jageed") affect fluency.
* **Coherence and Structure**: The narrative lacks a clear, linear progression from introduction to conclusion, with ideas not fully connected.
* **Overly Descriptive without Clarity**: While descriptive, the text often fails to clearly convey the location's relevance to Eden without assuming prior knowledge.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
