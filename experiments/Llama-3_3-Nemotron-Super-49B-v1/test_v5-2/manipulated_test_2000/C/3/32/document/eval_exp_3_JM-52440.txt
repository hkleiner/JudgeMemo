Issues:
* Repetitive explanations of the same concept (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified) without adding new depth.
* Abrupt transition from discussing the Church of England's documents to the personal stance on the Reformation principles without a clear connective tissue.
* Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs, potentially hindering smooth reading flow.
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and the Reformation, which might alienate less informed readers.
* No clear summary or transitional phrase connects the end of Chapter I with what the next chapter will entail, disrupting the narrative flow.
