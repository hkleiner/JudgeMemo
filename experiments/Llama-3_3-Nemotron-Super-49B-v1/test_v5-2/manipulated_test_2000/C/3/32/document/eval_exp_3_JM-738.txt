Issues:
* **Repetitive mentions** of "a thing" (clearly a placeholder or error) disrupt fluency and coherence.
* **Abrupt transitions** between historical context, character analysis, and story opening (e.g., from discussing Dickens' health to introducing _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_'s characters).
* **Lack of clarity** in some character relationships and motivations (e.g., the Princess Puffer's reasons for spying).
* **Overly academic tone** in the introduction may detach some readers from the narrative.
* **Incomplete sentences or thoughts** (e.g., "as one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark seemed, at least, to become suddenly clear").

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
