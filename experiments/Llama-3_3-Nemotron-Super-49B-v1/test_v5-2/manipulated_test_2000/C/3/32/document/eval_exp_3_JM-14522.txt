Issues:
* **"a thing"** appears multiple times, seemingly as a placeholder for a missing noun or phrase, disrupting fluency and coherence (e.g., "since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was frightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for dinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been seen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the thing, none of our younger servants would stay with us...").
* Minor inconsistencies in character descriptions (e.g., Washington Otis's expertise and the sudden, unexplained depth of discussion topics).
* Abrupt transition from the family's everyday conversation to the ghost's appearance without a clear narrative bridge.
* The character of Mrs. Umney's warning and its immediate aftermath feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the chapter's flow.
