Issues:
* **Repetitive use of "a thing"** (e.g., "in a thing, Massachusetts", "at the thing corner", "back a stuff") which is unclear and disrupts fluency. It appears to be a placeholder or error that was not corrected.
* **Abrupt transitions between scenes** in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" (e.g., from school to moving, to working, without smooth connections).
* **Lack of clear chronological markers** in the second chapter, making the timeline hard to follow (e.g., exact years are mentioned sporadically).
* **Minor grammatical and punctuation errors** (e.g., "he hasnâ€™t long to live, says you have been a good boy" - missing punctuation; "It is your second year in school. You now have a step-father." - could benefit from a transitional phrase for better coherence).
* **Some sentences are overly long and complex**, potentially hindering easy understanding (e.g., the paragraph describing Bradley's impact on American design).

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
