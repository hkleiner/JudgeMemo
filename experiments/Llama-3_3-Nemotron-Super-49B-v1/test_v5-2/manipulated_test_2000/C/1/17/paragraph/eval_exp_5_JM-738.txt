Issues:
* **Abrupt transitions** between historical/literary analysis (Introduction) and the actual story (The Story), disrupting narrative flow.
* **Overly complex, dense paragraphs** in the Introduction, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with Dickens' works or literary criticism.
* **Sudden, unexplained shift in tone and style** from analytical to descriptive/narrative.
* **Minor inconsistencies in character introduction flow** (e.g., the abrupt mention of "The Princess Puffer's" backstory without clear immediate relevance).
* **Some sentences are overly long and convoluted**, affecting readability (e.g., descriptions of character relationships and backstories).

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
