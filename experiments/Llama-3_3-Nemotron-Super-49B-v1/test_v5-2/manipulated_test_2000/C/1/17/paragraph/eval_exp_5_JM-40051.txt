Issues:
* **Abrupt Jumps in Narrative**: The story jumps abruptly between discussing the Garden of Eden, a romantic subplot involving Jasper and Rosa, a scene at Canterville Chase, a description of an office partition, and a reflection by George Stransom, with no clear connection between these segments.
* **Lack of Logical Sequencing**: Ideas and scenes are not logically sequenced, leading to confusion about the story's central theme or plot.
* **Repetitive and Unconnected Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions (e.g., of the Garden of Eden's location, the office partition, George Stransom's reflection) are repetitive within their own contexts or unconnected to the broader, incoherent narrative.
* **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation Errors**: Noted errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "commencing more than half way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top" lacks clarity) disrupt fluency.
* **Word Choice and Phrasing Issues**: Some phrasing is awkward (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing"), and word choices could be more precise for better clarity.
