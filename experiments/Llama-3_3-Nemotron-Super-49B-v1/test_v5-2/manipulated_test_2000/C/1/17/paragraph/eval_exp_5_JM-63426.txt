Issues:
* **Abrupt Transition**: The story jumps abruptly from discussing Will Bradley's introduction to a completely unrelated narrative about Stransom and Creston (appears to be a misplaced excerpt from another work, possibly Henry James' "The Last of the Old Masters" or a similar piece, given the style and character names).
* **Lack of Clear Structure**: The narrative shifts unpredictably between biography, anecdotal childhood stories, and what seems to be an excerpt from a different literary work without clear connections or transitions.
* **Inconsistency in Subject Focus**: The text begins with an introduction to Will Bradley but then dedicates a significant portion to an unrelated character's story and another to a detailed, seemingly biographical account of a boy (presumably young Will Bradley, but not clearly connected initially).
* **Grammar and Punctuation**: While generally good, there are minor issues (e.g., missing articles, slight awkwardness in long sentences) but not prevalent enough to heavily impact the fluency score.
* **Coherence Within Sections**: While individual sections (especially the biographical account of the boy) are coherent, the overall narrative lacks a cohesive thread connecting all parts logically.

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
