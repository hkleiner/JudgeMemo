Issues:
* Minor repetition in describing the re-appearance of the blood stain (could be more varied)
* Sudden shift in tone from eerie to comedic without clear transition (e.g., Mr. Otis's reaction to the ghost)
* Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., descriptions of family members' traits)
* The character of Mrs. Umney's concern and warning feels somewhat underutilized after introduction
* The transition between Chapter I and II could be smoother, with more contextual bridging
