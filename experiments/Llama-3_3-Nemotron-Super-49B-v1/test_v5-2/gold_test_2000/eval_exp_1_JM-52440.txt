Issues:
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and the Reformation, which might confuse less informed readers.
* Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas.
* Some sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially hindering readability.
* The author's objective (to ascertain the Church of England's teaching) is clear, but the path to the conclusion is somewhat predictable and lacks surprising insights.
* Biblical references (e.g., 1 Cor. x. 16, 17) are not fully contextualized for readers unfamiliar with the scriptures.
