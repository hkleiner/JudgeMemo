Issues:
* **Coherence**:
	+ Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery narrative (e.g., the shift from discussing God's placement of man to the author's personal realization).
	+ Lack of clear, logical connection between some biblical interpretations and the location's features (e.g., the leap from describing the Garden's requirements to its match in the Mississippi location).
	+ Repetitive emphasis on the location's beauty without strong, varied evidence linking it directly to Eden's biblical description.
	+ Sudden, unexplained shift in tone and content (e.g., from scientific/biblical analysis to discussing the greed of proprietors and then to snakes).
* **Fluency**:
	+ Archaic language and phrasing (e.g., "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it") that may hinder modern readability.
	+ Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph describing the location's geography).
	+ Inconsistent pacing; some sections are overly detailed (geography), while others are brief (transition from discovery to publication).
	+ Minor spelling/typographical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "commencing more than half way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top" could be clarified for better flow).
