Analysis: The story exhibits **high Fluency** with smooth syntax, varied and appropriate vocabulary, consistent grammar, and effective punctuation. The narrative flows effortlessly, making it easy to follow. However, there are occasional typos (e.g., "AN INTEODUCTION", "ghe", "tlme", "Narrow Gauge" inconsistency, "sjoes", "experkence", etc.) and minor formatting issues (inconsistent spacing, missing articles), which slightly detract from the overall polish.

**Coherence** is also **high**. The story is well-structured, with each chapter logically progressing the narrative. The author effectively weaves together Bradley's life events, influences, and contributions, maintaining a clear focus on his development as a designer and printer. Transitions between chapters are generally smooth, though some readers might find the shift between detailed early life chapters and later, more concise professional chapters slightly abrupt.

Rating:
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
