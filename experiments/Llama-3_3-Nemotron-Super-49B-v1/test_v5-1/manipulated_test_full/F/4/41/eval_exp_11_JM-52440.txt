Analysis: The text demonstrates high **Coherence** as it logically unfolds, with each chapter and section building upon the previous one, maintaining a clear structure and progression. The author's objective is consistently pursued throughout, examining the Church of England's doctrine through various authoritative documents. The text avoids ambiguities and abrupt jumps, ensuring a smooth flow of ideas. 

Regarding **Fluency**, the text reads smoothly, with proper syntax, grammar, and spelling. The language, though formal and somewhat archaic (reflecting the subject matter), is clear. However, the extensive length of sentences and paragraphs, along with the dense, theological subject matter, may impede effortless reading for some readers not familiar with the topic or style.
