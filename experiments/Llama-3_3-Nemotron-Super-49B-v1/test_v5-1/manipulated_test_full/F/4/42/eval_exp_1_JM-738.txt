Analysis: The story exhibits **high Fluency** with sophisticated syntax, varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The narrative flows smoothly, with well-structured sentences that rarely cause confusion. However, the **Coherence** is more complex: while the plot is intricately woven with suspenseful elements and character motivations, the unfinished nature of the story (due to Dickens' death) and the reliance on theoretical interpretations for resolution introduce some ambiguity and disjointedness, particularly in the latter chapters. The connections between some characters' actions and the overall mystery, while intriguing, sometimes feel speculative due to the lack of a conclusive ending.

FINAL Fluency Score: 5  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
