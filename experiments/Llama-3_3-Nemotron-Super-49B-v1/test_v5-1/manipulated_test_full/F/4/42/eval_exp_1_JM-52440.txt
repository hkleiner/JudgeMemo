Analysis: The text demonstrates high **Coherence** as it logically unfolds, with each chapter and section building upon the previous, maintaining a clear structure and progression. The author's objective is consistently pursued throughout, examining the Church of England's doctrine through its official documents. There are no abrupt jumps or ambiguities that detract from the narrative's flow. 

Regarding **Fluency**, the text reads smoothly, with proper syntax, grammar, and spelling. The language, while formal and somewhat archaic (reflecting the subject matter), is appropriate and consistent. However, the dense, lengthy paragraphs and complex sentence structures may impede effortless reading for some, particularly those unfamiliar with theological debates or 19th-century writing styles.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 5
