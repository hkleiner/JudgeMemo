Analysis: The story exhibits **high coherence** as it unfolds logically, with each chapter building upon the previous, maintaining a clear narrative arc. The themes of haunting, cultural clash, and redemption are consistently woven throughout. Transitions between scenes are generally smooth, except for a few abrupt shifts (e.g., the sudden appearance of the "YE OTIS GHOSTE" placard), which slightly disrupt the flow. **Fluency** is also **high**; the text is rich in vocabulary, with intricate sentence structures that, while sometimes lengthy, contribute to the narrative's Victorian-era charm. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are impeccable, with no errors noted. The language flows smoothly, engaging the reader despite its antiquated style.
