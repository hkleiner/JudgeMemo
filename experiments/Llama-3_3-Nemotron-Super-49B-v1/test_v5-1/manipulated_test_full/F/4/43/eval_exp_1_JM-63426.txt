Analysis: The story exhibits strong **Coherence** as it chronicles Will Bradley's life in a logically sequenced, non-repetitive manner, with each chapter building on the previous one to paint a comprehensive picture of his career and influences. The narrative flows smoothly from one section to another, with clear transitions and a consistent structure. While some sentences are long and a few paragraphs dense, the overall coherence is high. 

**Fluency** is also high, with mostly flawless syntax, grammar, and spelling. Word choice and phrasing are generally effective, contributing to a smooth read. However, some archaic language and lengthy, complex sentences may slightly impede the flow for modern readers.
