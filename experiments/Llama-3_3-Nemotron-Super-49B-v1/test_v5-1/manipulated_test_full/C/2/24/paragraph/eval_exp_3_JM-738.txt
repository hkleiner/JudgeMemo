Analysis: The story exhibits **high Fluency** with sophisticated syntax, varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The narrative flows smoothly, despite its complexity and the large cast of characters. The author's command of language is evident in the vivid descriptions and dialogue, which effectively convey the Victorian setting and characters' personalities.

**Coherence** is also strong, with a logically structured narrative that explores the mystery through multiple threads and character interactions. While the story is unfinished, the provided chapters demonstrate a clear progression and intentional pacing, building tension towards the unresolved climax. The author's use of foreshadowing (e.g., Durdles' sounds, Jasper's visions) and character motivations (e.g., Jasper's obsession, Helena's protectiveness) enhances the narrative's coherence.
