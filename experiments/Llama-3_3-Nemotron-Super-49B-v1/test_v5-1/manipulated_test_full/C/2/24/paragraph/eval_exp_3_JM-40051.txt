Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** as it meticulously weaves together biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes to build a compelling narrative around the Garden of Eden's location. The author's structure, though lengthy, logically progresses from introduction to evidence to conclusion, maintaining a clear thread of argument. However, **Fluency** is somewhat compromised by overly complex sentences, archaic language (e.g., "whilst", "thou"), and a mix of poetic descriptions with dry, factual information, which may hinder smooth reading for modern audiences.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
