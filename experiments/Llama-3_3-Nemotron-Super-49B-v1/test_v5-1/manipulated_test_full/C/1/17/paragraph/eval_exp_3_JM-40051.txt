Analysis: The story exhibits **strong Fluency** with sophisticated vocabulary, varied sentence structures, and minimal grammatical errors, contributing to a smooth reading experience. However, the text's **Coherence** is compromised by its meandering narrative, lack of clear sectioning, abrupt topic shifts (e.g., the sudden appearance of unrelated characters like George Stransom and Jasper), and excessive detail that detracts from the central claim about the Garden of Eden.

Rating:
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
FINAL Coherence Score: 2
