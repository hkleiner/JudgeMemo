Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** as it systematically explores the doctrine of the Lord's Supper through a clear, structured argument, referencing specific Church of England documents in a logical sequence. The narrative flows smoothly from introduction, through examination of key points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), to a conclusion, maintaining focus on the central theme. However, **Fluency** is somewhat impacted by dense, archaic language, lengthy sentences, and occasional insertions of unrelated narrative snippets (e.g., descriptions of artworks, unrelated character stories), which, though minor, disrupt the otherwise consistent theological discourse.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
