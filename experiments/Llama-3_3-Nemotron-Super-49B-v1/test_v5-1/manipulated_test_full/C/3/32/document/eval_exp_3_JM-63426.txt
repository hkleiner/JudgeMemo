Analysis: 
The story exhibits **high coherence** as it chronicles Will Bradley's life in a structured, chronological manner. Each chapter seamlessly transitions to the next, maintaining a clear narrative flow. The author's use of reflective commentary and contextual details (e.g., historical references) enhances the story's depth and logical progression. However, some sections feel slightly disjointed due to the inclusion of detailed, almost encyclopedic, information (e.g., the extensive chronology and award descriptions), which, while informative, slightly detract from the narrative's immediacy.

**Fluency** is also **high**. The text is predominantly well-written, with varied sentence structures and engaging descriptive language (e.g., vivid descriptions of 19th-century settings). However, there are instances of slightly archaic language and occasional awkward phrasing ("the stuff," repeated placeholders for proper nouns), which might momentarily disrupt the smooth reading experience. These placeholders, in particular, are distracting and reduce the overall fluency.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
