Analysis: The story exhibits **high coherence** as it intricately weaves multiple plot threads, character motivations, and suspenseful elements, maintaining a logical and engaging narrative flow despite its complexity. The author's use of foreshadowing, character development (e.g., Jasper's opium-induced visions, Helena's protectiveness), and the gradual unraveling of mysteries contribute to its coherence. However, the extensive theorizing and multiple interpretations within the narrative might slightly detract from the overall clarity for some readers.

**Fluency** is also **high**; the text is rich in vocabulary, with complex sentence structures that flow well, enhancing the narrative's depth. The writing style, while dense and occasionally archaic, suits the Victorian setting and themes, with effective use of dialogue and descriptive passages. Minor issues include some lengthy, dense paragraphs and the incorporation of theorizing sections that might disrupt the flow for some readers.
