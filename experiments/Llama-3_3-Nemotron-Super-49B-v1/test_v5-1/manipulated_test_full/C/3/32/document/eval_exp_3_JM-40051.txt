Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** as it meticulously weaves together biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes to build a compelling narrative around the Garden of Eden's location. The author's structure, though lengthy, logically progresses from introduction to detailed description and defense against potential critiques, maintaining a clear thread throughout. However, **Fluency** is somewhat compromised by overly complex sentences, frequent use of archaic language ("thou", "thee"), and repetitive phrasing, which may hinder smooth reading for modern audiences.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
