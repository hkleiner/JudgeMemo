Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Fluency** with polished syntax, varied and appropriate word choice, consistent grammar, and effective phrasing, making it a smooth read. However, minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, slight spacing issues) prevent a perfect score. **Coherence** is also high, with a clear narrative structure, logical progression, and effective connections between ideas. Yet, the abrupt transition between chapters and some dense, unreferenced historical contexts might slightly confuse readers.

Rating:
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
