Analysis: The text exhibits mostly clear and grammatically correct sentences, contributing to its Fluency. However, the narrative is occasionally marred by overly long, convoluted sentences and some archaic language, which can hinder smooth reading. Regarding Coherence, the story has a clear central thesis (identifying a location as the Garden of Eden) and progresses logically in presenting the author's case. Yet, the text suffers from repetitiveness (e.g., reiterating the garden's beauty) and abrupt transitions between descriptive sections, slightly disrupting the narrative flow.

Rating:
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
