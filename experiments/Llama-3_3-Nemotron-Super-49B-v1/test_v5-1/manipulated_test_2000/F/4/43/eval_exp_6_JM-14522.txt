Analysis: The story, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits **high fluency** with impeccable syntax, grammar, and word choice, characteristic of Wilde's wit and late 19th-century literary flair. The narrative flows smoothly, with well-crafted sentences and effective pacing. **Coherence** is also strong, with a logically sequenced introduction to the setting, characters, and the ghostly premise. The story unfolds with clear progression, though the abrupt transition from Chapter I to a non-existent "Chapter: nothing" and the immediate dive into Chapter II's events might slightly disrupt the narrative flow for some readers. However, this is a stylistic choice that, in the context of the full work, likely serves a purpose.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
