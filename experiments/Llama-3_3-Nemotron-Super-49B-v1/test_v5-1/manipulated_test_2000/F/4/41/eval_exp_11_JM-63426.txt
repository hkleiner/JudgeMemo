Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** with a logically sequenced narrative, clear progression, and minimal ambiguities. The story unfolds smoothly across chapters, maintaining focus on Will Bradley's life and impact. **Fluency** is also high, with engaging phrasing, varied sentence structure, and mostly error-free writing. However, minor typos (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "teh", "wre", "cems", "qant", "esucation", missing articles) and a few awkwardly long sentences slightly detract from perfect fluency.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
