Analysis: The text exhibits strong coherence, with a clear introduction setting the objective, a logical progression through chapters, and well-connected ideas exploring the doctrine in question. The author's structure and use of transitional phrases ("Thus far, I presume...", "Now it would be strange indeed...") enhance coherence. However, some sentences are lengthy and complex, which might slightly impede fluency for casual readers. Grammatically, the text is mostly sound, with only a few minor errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in several places), and word choice is appropriate, contributing to overall good fluency despite the complexity.
