Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** with a clear narrative structure, logical progression, and effective connections between ideas across chapters. The introduction seamlessly transitions into the biographical chapter, maintaining focus on Will Bradley's impact and background. However, minor ambiguities (e.g., abrupt scene changes in "The Boy Printer") slightly detract from overall coherence. 
**Fluency** is high, with engaging, varied sentence structures and vivid imagery, though marred by numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "it shoulded," "was know," "donâ€™t worked," inconsistent verb tenses) that disrupt the smooth reading experience.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
