Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** with a well-structured narrative that logically unfolds, connecting ideas smoothly across chapters. The introduction sets a clear direction, and each section builds upon the previous, maintaining focus on unraveling Dickens's last plot. However, there are minor ambiguities (e.g., unspecified locations like "a thing") and abrupt transitions between historical context and story analysis, slightly detracting from overall coherence. 

**Fluency** is high, with sophisticated vocabulary, proper grammar, and punctuation. The writing is engaging, though the dense, academic tone and some archaic language ("a stuff") may impede smooth reading for non-expert readers. Sentences are mostly well-phrased, but their complexity and length vary greatly, occasionally disrupting the flow.
