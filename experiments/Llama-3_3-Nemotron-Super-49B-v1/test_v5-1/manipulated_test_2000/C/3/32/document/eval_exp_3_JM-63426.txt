Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** as it unfolds Will Bradley's life and impact in a logically sequenced manner, connecting his early life to his later influence. The narrative is clear, non-repetitive, and progresses smoothly, with minimal ambiguities. **Fluency** is also high, with smooth syntax, appropriate word choice, and mostly error-free writing. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., repeated use of "a thing" without clear context) and some sentence structures could be more varied for enhanced flow.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
