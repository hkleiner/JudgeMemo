Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Fluency** with polished syntax, varied and appropriate word choice, and minimal to no grammatical or spelling errors, contributing to a smooth reading experience. However, **Coherence** is somewhat compromised by abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from discussing Will Bradley's impact to a seemingly unrelated narrative about Stransom, and then to Bradley's biography without clear connectors), lack of explicit links between some paragraphs, and a narrative jump in focus (from Bradley's professional impact to a detailed, unrelated biographical sketch of "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without clear connection to Bradley, assuming this refers to Bradley's early life which isn't explicitly stated).

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
