Analysis: The story appears to be a compilation of unrelated excerpts from different texts, genres, and styles, lacking a cohesive narrative thread. This disjointedness severely impacts **Coherence** (logical sequence, connection between ideas, and overall structure), as the reader is abruptly shifted between scenes, topics (e.g., theological discussion, ghost story, personal reflection), and writing tones without transition or narrative link. 

Regarding **Fluency**, while individual sentences often exhibit good grammar, spelling, and phrasing (especially in the more formal, theological sections), the overall **Fluency** is compromised by the jarring transitions between excerpts, which disrupts the smooth flow of the text as a whole.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 1
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
