Analysis: The text exhibits strong coherence, with a clear introduction setting the stage for the exploration of the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The narrative logically progresses from introducing the controversy to outlining the plan for investigation, focusing on key points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each section connects smoothly to the next, building a coherent argument. The author maintains a consistent structure, referencing Church documents to support the analysis, which enhances the narrative's clarity and logical flow. 

Fluency is also high, characterized by complex yet clear sentence structures, appropriate vocabulary (e.g., "sacramental use," "invisibly"), and correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The text flows smoothly, with no noticeable awkward phrasing or errors, making it easy to follow despite its theological complexity.
