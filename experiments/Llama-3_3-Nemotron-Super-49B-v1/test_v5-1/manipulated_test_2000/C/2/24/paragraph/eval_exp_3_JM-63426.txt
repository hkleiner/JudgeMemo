Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Fluency** with polished syntax, varied and appropriate word choice, and minimal to no grammatical or spelling errors, contributing to a smooth reading experience. The narrative flows naturally, making it easy to follow. 
**Coherence** is also high, with a clear, logically sequenced structure across both chapters. Ideas connect smoothly, and the transition from discussing Bradley's impact to his childhood is well-managed, maintaining narrative integrity. However, the abrupt mention of unrelated elements (e.g., "The home assistant played ambient music," "An livestream began recording," "The energy grid remained balanced") disrupts coherence slightly, feeling out of place.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
