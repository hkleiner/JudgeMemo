Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Coherence** with a well-structured narrative that logically unfolds, connecting ideas across chapters and sections. The introduction sets a clear direction, and each subsequent part builds upon the previous, maintaining a coherent analysis of Dickens's last plot. However, there's a minor abruptness in the transition to the "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" section without clear contextual lead-in. **Fluency** is high, with sophisticated vocabulary, correct grammar, and punctuation, contributing to a smooth read. Yet, the dense, academic tone and lengthy sentences may impede flow for some readers.
