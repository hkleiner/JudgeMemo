Analysis: The text exhibits strong coherence, with a clear, logically sequenced narrative that builds a case for the location of the Garden of Eden. The author transitions smoothly between biblical references, personal discovery, and geographical descriptions. However, fluency is somewhat compromised by overly complex sentences, occasional awkward phrasing, and a somewhat archaic tone, which may hinder smooth reading for modern audiences.

Rating:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
