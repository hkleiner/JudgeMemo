Analysis: The story exhibits **high coherence** as it unfolds logically, with each chapter building upon the previous, maintaining a clear narrative arc from introduction to resolution. The themes of haunting, cultural clash, and redemption are consistently woven throughout. Transitions between chapters are smooth, and the plot's progression is easy to follow, with minimal ambiguity. The only slight deviation in coherence is the somewhat abrupt shift in tone in Chapter VII, but it does not significantly detract from the overall narrative flow.

**Fluency** is also **high**; the text reads smoothly, with sophisticated vocabulary, varied sentence structures, and effective use of dialogue to reveal character. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are impeccable, contributing to an effortless reading experience. The narrative voice is consistent, and the language, while sometimes archaic to match the setting, flows well and enhances the story's atmosphere.
