**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**

#### **Fluency:**
1. **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate comprehension.
2. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without significant addition to the argument, causing redundancy.
3. **Archaic Language and Structure**: The text employs outdated linguistic structures and vocabulary (e.g., "thou," "thee"), which may hinder readability for modern readers.
4. **Abrupt Transitions Between Chapters**: The flow between chapters could be smoother, with more explicit connections between topics.
5. **Random, Unrelated Technical Interruptions** (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched."): These disrupt the narrative flow without relevance to the content.

#### **Coherence:**
1. **Clear Argumentative Structure**: Despite length, the text maintains a logical argument flow.
2. **Well-Defined Objectives**: The author's intent is clearly stated at the outset.
3. **Overreliance on Assumed Knowledge**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and historical context, which might confuse less informed readers.
4. **Selective Quoting**: While sources are quoted to support arguments, the selection could be more balanced to strengthen the coherence of the argument against counterpoints.
5. **Emotional Appeals**: Towards the end, the text shifts to emotional appeals, which, while understandable, slightly detracts from the otherwise scholarly tone.

### **Scores**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Rationale**: The text is largely coherent with a clear, well-structured argument. However, points of assumed knowledge and the shift in tone towards the end prevent a perfect score.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Rationale**: Despite being understandable, the text's fluency is markedly reduced by lengthy sentences, archaic language, repetitive phrasing, and unrelated technical interruptions.
