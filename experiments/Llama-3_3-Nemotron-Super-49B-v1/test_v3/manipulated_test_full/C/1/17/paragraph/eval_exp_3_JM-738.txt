**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

* **Issues Affecting Fluency:**
  1. **Lengthy, Complex Sentences**: Many sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading.
  2. **Archaisms and Outdated Language**: Use of phrases like "whilst", "methinks", and "doth" may confuse or slow modern readers.
  3. **Repetitive Explanations**: Some points (e.g., theories about Datchery's identity) are repeated without significant new insight.
  4. **Abrupt Transitions Between Ideas**: Shifts between analyzing the story, discussing character theories, and critiquing other theorists can be jarring.
  5. **Lack of Clear Sectioning for Different Topics**: The text blends various themes (character analysis, plot theory, critique of other works) without clear divisions.

* **Fluency Score Rationale**: Despite the text's depth of analysis, the aforementioned issues significantly impact readability, making the text challenging for casual or even dedicated readers to follow without close attention.

### **Coherence**

* **Issues Affecting Coherence:**
  1. **Non-Linear Presentation of Theories**: Theories and counter-theories are presented in a manner that lacks a clear, building narrative of argument.
  2. **Assumptions Without Clear Premise**: Some conclusions are drawn without explicitly stating the underlying assumptions.
  3. **Tangents (e.g., Millet's Art, Zulu War Reference)**: Unrelated topics briefly interrupt the flow without contributing to the main argument.
  4. **Character and Plot Point Overemphasis**: While detailed, the focus on certain characters/plots sometimes overshadows the broader narrative analysis.
  5. **Unclear Resolution**: The conclusion, while attempting to tie things up, leaves some threads (e.g., the fate of certain characters in the proposed resolution) not fully integrated.

* **Coherence Score Rationale**: The text's coherence is compromised by its non-linear argumentation, tangents, and the overwhelming depth of certain analyses at the expense of others, though the central argument about the mystery's solution is consistently pursued.

### **Final Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
*Rationale: The text's coherence is impacted by its structure and tangents, but it maintains a central argument throughout.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
*Rationale: Significant challenges in sentence structure
