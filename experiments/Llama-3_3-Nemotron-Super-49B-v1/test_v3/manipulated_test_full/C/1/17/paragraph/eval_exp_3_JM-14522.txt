**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Sentence Construction, Grammar, Punctuation, Word Choice)**

* **Strengths**:
	+ Engaging, witty dialogue.
	+ Vivid, descriptive language enhancing the Gothic and humorous elements.
* **Issues Affecting Fluency Score**:
	1. **Lengthy, Complex Sentences**: Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding.
	2. **Archaisms and Formal Language**: While fitting for the period setting, may cause readability issues for some modern readers.
	3. **Abrupt Transitions Between Chapters/Scenes**: Little to no transitional phrases or sentences, making jumps between scenes somewhat jarring.
	4. **Insertion of Unrelated Text Snippets** (e.g., discussions on animal adaptation, Filipino daily routines): Severely disrupts flow and relevance.
	5. **Minor Punctuation and Grammar Errors** (not extensively listed due to focus on overall quality): A few instances noticed, though not pervasive.

### **Coherence (Organization, Logical Flow, Consistency)**

* **Strengths**:
	+ Overall narrative arc is clear and engaging.
	+ Character interactions logically progress the story.
* **Issues Affecting Coherence Score**:
1. **Non-Sequitur Text Inclusions** (as mentioned above): Completely disrupt the narrative's coherence.
2. **Character Development**: While main characters are well-defined, some (like the twins) feel more like caricatures than fully fleshed out.
3. **Pacing Issues**: The story's pacing is generally well-managed, but the final chapters feel slightly rushed compared to the detailed buildup.
4. **Predictability of the Ghost's Fate**: For some readers, the outcome might be too foreseeable, reducing tension.

### **Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
*Rationale*: Despite a clear narrative arc, the inclusion of unrelated text snippets and some pacing issues significantly impact the score.

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
*Rationale*: Engaging language and witty dialogue are somewhat offset by lengthy sentences, archaisms, and the noted minor errors, but the text remains largely readable and enjoyable.
