**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

**Issues Affecting Fluency Score:**

1. **Lengthy, Complex Sentences**: Many sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading.
2. **Non-Linear Narrative**: The story jumps between different periods of the subject's life without clear transitions, causing disorientation.
3. **Lack of Paragraph Unity**: Some paragraphs contain multiple, unrelated ideas or shift topics abruptly.
4. **Archaic Language and Phrases**: Use of outdated expressions (e.g., "make-up time", "newsstand salesmen") may confuse modern readers.
5. **Repetitive Information**: Certain details or themes are repeated without significant addition to the narrative.
6. **Abrupt Shifts in Tone**: Transitions between biographical narrative, descriptive passages, and reflective commentary are not always smooth.
7. **Technical Jargon**: Unexplained printing and design terminology may alienate non-specialist readers.

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 3

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well the ideas are organized, the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, and the consistency of the narrative.

**Issues Affecting Coherence Score:**

1. **Disjointed Chapters**: Chapters sometimes feel like separate essays rather than cohesive parts of a whole.
2. **Lack of Clear Chronological Flow**: The narrative frequently jumps back and forth in time without clear indicators.
3. **Unconnected Anecdotes**: Some stories or examples seem included without a clear connection to the broader narrative arc.
4. **Shifts in Narrative Voice**: Unmarked shifts between first-person, second-person, and third-person narration can be confusing.
5. **Insufficient Context for Historical References**: Assuming reader familiarity with all historical and cultural references without explanation.
6. **Conclusion Feels Tacked On**: The final reflective chapter on modern opportunities for designers feels somewhat detached from the preceding biography.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 2.5
