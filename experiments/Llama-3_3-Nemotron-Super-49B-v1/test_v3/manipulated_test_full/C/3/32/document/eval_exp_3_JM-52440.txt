**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Scores**

#### **Fluency:**
1. **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate comprehension.
2. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without significant addition to the argument, causing redundancy.
3. **Archaisms and Formal Language**: The use of outdated vocabulary (e.g., "a thing" likely referring to "the Church") and highly formal tone may hinder readability for modern readers.
4. **Lack of Transitional Phrases**: The text could benefit from more transitional elements to guide the reader smoothly between paragraphs and chapters.

#### **Coherence:**
1. **Clear Argument Structure**: Despite length, the argument against the Doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England is well-structured.
2. **Effective Use of Sources**: The text effectively cites and interprets various Church documents to support its claims.
3. **Minor Ambiguities in References**: Occasionally, references (e.g., "a thing") are unclear without context, slightly obscuring the narrative.
4. **Emotional Appeal Over Objective Tone in Conclusions**: The final sections veer towards emotional appeal, which, while effective for persuasion, slightly detracts from objective coherence.

### **Scores with Rationale**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Rationale**: The text maintains a clear, well-supported argument throughout, effectively using Church documents. However, minor ambiguities in references and a shift towards emotional appeal in the conclusion prevent a perfect score.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Rationale**: While the text is readable for those familiar with formal, theological discourse, its lengthy sentences, repetitive phrasing, archaisms, and lack of transitional phrases significantly impact its overall fluency for a broader audience.
