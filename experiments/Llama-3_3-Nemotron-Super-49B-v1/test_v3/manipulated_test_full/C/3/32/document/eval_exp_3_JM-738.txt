**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

* **Issues Affecting Fluency:**
  1. **Lengthy, Complex Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long and convoluted, hindering easy comprehension.
  2. **Archaic Language and Formatting**: Use of outdated terms (e.g., "a stuff", inconsistent naming conventions) and chapter headings ("CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION") can confuse modern readers.
  3. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Phrases like "Mr. Cuming Walters argues" or similar constructions are repeated frequently without variation.
  4. **Lack of Clear Transitions**: Transitions between ideas, especially between theoretical discussions and evidence presentation, are not always smooth.
  5. **Overuse of Quotations**: While useful, the extensive use of quotations disrupts the flow for the reader not familiar with the referenced works.

* **Fluency Score:** 3

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized, the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, and the clarity of transitions.

* **Issues Affecting Coherence:**
  1. **Non-Linear Presentation of Theories**: Theories by different authors (Mr. Proctor, Mr. Cuming Walters) are interwoven without a clear comparative framework.
  2. **Abrupt Shifts in Focus**: The text jumps between analyzing the story, discussing character identities, and speculating on the author's intentions without clear sectioning.
  3. **Assumed Prior Knowledge**: The text assumes readers are familiar with Dickens' works, the story of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", and its historical context.
  4. **Unresolved Speculations**: Multiple speculative theories are presented without a clear conclusion or weighting of their validity.
  5. **Tangential Discussions (e.g., Theories on Jasper's Parentage)**: While interesting, these divert from the central mystery analysis.

* **Coherence Score:** 2.5

### **Final Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
