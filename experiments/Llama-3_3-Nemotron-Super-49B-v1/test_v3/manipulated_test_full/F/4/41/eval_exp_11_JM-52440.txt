**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Scores**

#### **Fluency:**
1. **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate understanding.
2. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without significant addition to the argument, causing redundancy.
3. **Archaic Language and Spelling**: Use of outdated terms (e.g., "thou", "thee", archaic spellings like "verily") may hinder modern readers' fluency.
4. **Density of Content**: High conceptual density in paragraphs makes them dense and challenging to navigate.

#### **Coherence:**
1. **Clear Structure**: The text is well-organized into chapters and topics, enhancing coherence.
2. **Logical Flow**: Arguments generally follow a logical sequence, though sometimes obscured by length and redundancy.
3. **Overreliance on Assumed Knowledge**: Assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's history and doctrines.
4. **Transition Smoothness**: Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to guide the reader more effectively.

### **Detailed Scores with Rationale**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Rationale**: The text excels in structural organization and logical argument flow, which are key to coherence. However, it deducts for not always ensuring a seamless transition between ideas and assuming a high baseline of specific knowledge without adequate contextualization for all readers.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Rationale**: While the text is readable for those familiar with formal, somewhat archaic theological discourse, its fluency is markedly reduced for the general reader due to lengthy sentences, repetitive elements, and the use of outdated language, which collectively hinder smooth reading.
