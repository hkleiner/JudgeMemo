**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**

#### **Fluency:**
1. **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate comprehension.
2. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without significant addition to the argument, causing redundancy.
3. **Archaisms and Formal Language**: The text's antiquated vocabulary and formal tone may hinder readability for modern readers.
4. **Lack of Transitional Phrases**: The transition between some paragraphs feels abrupt, lacking smooth connectors.
5. **Complex Theological Terminology**: Assumes a high level of familiarity with theological terms, potentially alienating less knowledgeable readers.

#### **Coherence:**
1. **Clear Argument Structure**: The text has a well-defined introduction, body, and conclusion, each addressing a specific aspect of the doctrine.
2. **Logical Flow Within Chapters**: Ideas within each chapter are generally well-connected.
3. **Overly Defensive Tone**: At times, the defensive posture against opposing views slightly detracts from the clarity of the central argument.
4. **Assumption of Prior Knowledge**: Besides theological terms, the text assumes familiarity with the Church of England's historical context and documents.
5. **Length and Depth**: While detailed, the extensive analysis of each document might overwhelm readers seeking a concise overview.

### **Scores**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Rationale**: Despite minor issues with tone and assumptions of prior knowledge, the text's structure and the logical progression of ideas within each chapter maintain high coherence.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Rationale**: Hindered by lengthy sentences, archaisms, and the lack of transitional phrases, the text's fluency is impacted, making it less accessible to a broad audience.
