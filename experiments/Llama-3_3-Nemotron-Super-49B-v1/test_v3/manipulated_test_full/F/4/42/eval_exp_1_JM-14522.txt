**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Sentence Construction, Grammar, Punctuation, Word Choice)**

* **Strengths**:
	+ Engaging, humorous, and satirical tone throughout.
	+ Rich, descriptive language that paints vivid scenes.
* **Issues Affecting Fluency Score**:
	1. **Archaisms and Formal Language**: While fitting for the period setting, may hinder readability for some modern readers. (Impact: 2/5)
	2. **Long, Complex Sentences**: Frequent use of lengthy, convoluted sentences can disrupt flow. (Impact: 3/5)
	3. **Repetitive Descriptive Phrases for Characters**: Especially for the ghost and Virginia, though effective in characterization. (Impact: 1.5/5)
	4. **Occasional Overuse of Adjectives**: Contributes to a slightly ornate, less streamlined narrative. (Impact: 2/5)

1. **Non-Linear Narrative Elements**: While mostly linear, some backstory integrations feel slightly abrupt. (Impact: 2/5)
2. **Pacing Issues**: Chapters vary significantly in length and intensity, affecting overall flow. (Impact: 3/5)

4. **Transition Between Chapters**: Occasionally, the link between chapters could be smoother. (Impact: 2/5)
5. **Conclusion Feels Slightly Rushed**: The tying up of loose ends, especially regarding Virginia's secret, might benefit from more elaboration. (Impact: 3/5)
