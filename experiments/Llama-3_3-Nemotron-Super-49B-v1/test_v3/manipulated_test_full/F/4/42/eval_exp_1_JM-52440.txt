**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**

#### **Fluency:**
1. **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate comprehension.
2. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without significant addition to the argument, causing redundancy.
3. **Archaic Language and Structure**: The text employs outdated vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thou") and sentence structures, potentially hindering readability for modern readers.
4. **Lack of Transitional Phrases**: The transition between some paragraphs and chapters feels abrupt, lacking smooth connectors.

#### **Coherence:**
1. **Clear Argumentative Structure**: Despite length, the text maintains a logical flow in arguing its point.
2. **Well-Defined Objectives**: The author clearly states the investigation's goal at the outset.
3. **Overreliance on Assumed Knowledge**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and historical context, which might confuse less informed readers.
4. **Lengthy Chapters Without Subheadings**: The lack of subheadings within lengthy chapters (e.g., Chapter I) can make navigation and focusing on specific points challenging.

### **Ratings with Justifications**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Justification**: The text is highly coherent in its argumentative flow, clearly defining its objectives and logically connecting its examination of different Church documents to support its claim. The only deductions are for assuming a high baseline of reader knowledge and the lack of subdivisions in lengthy chapters, which slightly impedes ease of follow-up.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Justification**: While the text is readable for those accustomed to formal, historical, or theological writings, its fluency is markedly reduced by lengthy sentences, archaic language, and the absence of transitional phrases between sections, making it less accessible to a broader audience.
