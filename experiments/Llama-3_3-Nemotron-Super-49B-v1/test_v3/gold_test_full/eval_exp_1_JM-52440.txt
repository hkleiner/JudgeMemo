**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Scores**

#### **Fluency:**
1. **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate comprehension.
2. **Repetitive Phrasing**: Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without significant addition to the argument, causing redundancy.
3. **Archaisms and Formality**: The text's highly formal, somewhat antiquated language may hinder readability for modern readers.
4. **Technical/Theological Jargon**: Assumes a high level of familiarity with theological and historical contexts, potentially alienating less informed readers.

#### **Coherence:**
1. **Clear Structure**: The text is well-organized into chapters and topics, enhancing overall coherence.
2. **Logical Flow Within Sections**: Ideas within each chapter or section logically follow one another.
3. **Overly Defensive Tone**: At times, the defensive posture against opposing views slightly detracts from the straightforward presentation of the Church of England's teachings.
4. **Assumed Knowledge**: The depth of theological and historical context assumed of the reader can make the text challenging to follow for those without a strong background in these areas.

### **Detailed Scores with Rationale**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Rationale**: The text excels in structural coherence with a clear chapter and topic organization. The logical flow within sections is strong, making the author's points easy to follow for those familiar with the context. However, the assumed knowledge and occasional defensive tone slightly reduce the score.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Rationale**: While the text is well-structured, its fluency is impacted by lengthy sentences, redundancy in phrasing, and the use of formal, antiquated language. Additionally, the dense theological jargon reduces readability for a broader audience, leading to a moderate fluency score.
