**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **Strengths**: The text exhibits a high level of readability with well-constructed sentences, appropriate grammar, and engaging vocabulary, making it generally smooth to read.
* **Weaknesses/Issues**:
  * **[a]** Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "a thing Street", "a stuff", "the stuff drawl") suggests missing or incorrectly placed words, disrupting fluency.
  * **[b]** Some sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially challenging for all readers to follow without close attention (e.g., the detailed description of Mrs. Otis and the family's conversation topics).
  * **[c]** The transition between Chapter I and II could be smoother; the abrupt start of Chapter II might slightly disorient readers.

### **Coherence**

* **Strengths**: The narrative is well-organized, with a clear logical flow between scenes and chapters. Ideas build upon each other effectively, maintaining reader engagement.
* **Weaknesses/Issues**:
  * **[a]** The character of "the thing" (later clarified as Washington Otis in context, but initially confusing due to missing/inconsistent naming) causes temporary confusion.
  * **[b]** The sudden introduction of "a stuff" in various contexts (e.g., "a stuff Street", "the stuff drawl") without clear explanation or consistency hampers understanding.
  * **[c]** While the story's tone is generally consistent, the shift from humorous skepticism to the ghost's appearance could be more subtly managed for a seamless coherence.

### **Issues List (Bulleted for Clarity)**

* **Fluency Issues**:
  + Awkward phrasing due to apparent missing/inconsistent words (e.g., "a thing", "a stuff")
  + Occasionally lengthy and complex sentences
  + Slightly abrupt chapter transition
* **Coherence Issues**:
  + Inconsistent/missing character naming ("the thing" initially)
  + Unclear references ("a stuff" in various contexts)
  + Tone shift management between skepticism and supernatural elements

### **FINAL Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
*Rationale: Despite minor issues with character naming and some contextual clarity, the overall narrative flow and logical progression of ideas are strong.*

FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
*Rationale: While the text is generally fluent, the deducted point accounts for the awkward phrasings, lengthy sentences, and the chapter
