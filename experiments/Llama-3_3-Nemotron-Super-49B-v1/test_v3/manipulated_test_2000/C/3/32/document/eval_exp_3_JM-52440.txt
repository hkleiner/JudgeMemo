**Assessment of the Text's Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings (Bulleted Points)**

#### **Fluency:**
- **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, complicating immediate comprehension.
- **Repetitive Phrasing**: Phrases like "it is [adverb] [verb]" and similar constructions are repeated, causing redundancy.
- **Archaic Language/Structure**: Uses outdated language (e.g., "thou", "whomsoever", "doth") and sentence structures that may hinder modern readers' fluency.
- **Technical/Theological Jargon**: Assumes a high level of familiarity with theological terms and concepts without explanation.

#### **Coherence:**
- **Abrupt Transitions**: Transitions between paragraphs or ideas could be smoother, sometimes leaving the reader to infer connections.
- **Scope Clarity**: The introduction promises a focus on the Church of England's doctrine, but the text frequently contrasts it with Roman Catholic and Reformation principles without clear signaling of these shifts in scope.
- **Overly Broad Assertions**: Statements about the Church of England's situation and the intentions of its members/supporters are broad and not directly tied to the central argument about the Lord's Supper doctrine.

### **Detailed Ratings with Justifications**

#### **Fluency (Scale: 1-5)**
- **Rating: 3**
- **Justification**: While the text is mostly clear in its sentence construction and free of major grammatical errors, the lengthy sentences, archaic language, and repetitive phrasing significantly impact its readability for a general audience, thus preventing a higher score.

#### **Coherence (Scale: 1-5)**
- **Rating: 4**
- **Justification**: The text is well-organized around its central theme of examining the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The logical flow within each chapter is strong, and the author clearly states their objective. However, the coherence is slightly marred by abrupt transitions between ideas and the broad, unsupported assertions about the Church's state, which slightly detract from the overall coherence.
