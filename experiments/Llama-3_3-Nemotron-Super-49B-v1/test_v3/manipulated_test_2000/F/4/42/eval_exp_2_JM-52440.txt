**Assessment of the Text's Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**

#### **Fluency:**
- **Grammar and Verb Tense Consistency:** Frequent inconsistencies in verb tense (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are") and incorrect subject-verb agreement.
- **Word Choice and Repetition:** Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "sifting time" might confuse some readers), and there's repetition in ideas without significant elaboration.
- **Sentence Structure Variety:** Dominance of long, complex sentences; lack of shorter sentences for breath and clarity.
- **Punctuation for Clarity:** Could benefit from additional punctuation (e.g., commas for lists, em dashes for interruptions) to enhance readability.

#### **Coherence:**
- **Transition Between Ideas:** Sometimes abrupt transitions between paragraphs or ideas without clear linking phrases.
- **Clear Thesis Statement:** While the objective is clear, it could be more prominently stated at the outset.
- **Depth of Analysis vs. Assertion:** At times, assertions are made without immediate evidence or deeper analysis to support them, potentially leaving the reader seeking more substantiation.
- ** Audience Clarity:** Assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and the Reformation, which might alienate some readers.

### **Detailed Ratings with Justifications**

#### **Fluency: 3**
- **Justification:** The text is mostly readable but hindered by grammatical errors, lack of sentence structure variety, and some ambiguous word choices. A reader can generally follow the text but with some effort due to the mentioned issues.

#### **Coherence: 4**
- **Justification:** The text is well-organized around its central theme, with a clear investigative approach outlined. However, coherence is slightly diminished by abrupt transitions and the assumption of extensive background knowledge. The logical flow is generally strong, supporting a high coherence score despite these minor flaws.
