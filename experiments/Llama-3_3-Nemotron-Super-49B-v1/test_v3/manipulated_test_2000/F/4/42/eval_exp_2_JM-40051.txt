**Assessment with Issues**

### **Coherence (Organization and Logical Flow)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ The text has a clear overall structure (introduction, presentation of discovery, detailed description, conclusion).
	+ The author attempts to connect biblical descriptions with the discovered location.
* **Weaknesses (Issues Affecting Score):**
	1. **Abrupt Transitions**: Sudden shifts between biblical analysis, personal discovery narrative, and detailed geographical description without smooth transitions.
	2. **Lack of Clear Thesis Statement**: The central argument ("This is the Garden of Eden") is introduced casually and not strongly reinforced until later.
	3. **Tangents**: Discussions about the city of La Crosse's development and the name's significance, while interesting, slightly detract from the main point.
	4. **Assumptions Without Clear Evidence**: The leap from description to "this is Eden" is made without convincing, detailed scholarly or biblical analysis to support the claim comprehensively.
	5. **Conclusion Feels Abrupt**: The text ends somewhat suddenly without a summarizing statement that reinforces the main claim with the evidence provided.

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Grammar)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Generally, sentences are structured to convey a clear meaning.
	+ The author shows a good command of vocabulary.
* **Weaknesses (Issues Affecting Score):**
	1. **Grammatical Errors**:
		- "had venture to published it" (should be "ventured to publish")
		- "I is ignorant" (should be "I was ignorant")
		- "woulded have been" (should be "would have been")
		- Numerous subject-verb agreement issues.
	2. **Punctuation Issues**:
		- Inconsistent or missing commas for clarity.
		- Overuse of dashes without clear stylistic consistency.
	3. **Word Choice and Redundancy**:
		- "sensibly impressed by a suggestion" could be more concise.
		- Repetitive descriptions of beauty without adding new insight.
	4. **Sentence Complexity**:
		- Some sentences are overly long and complex, reducing readability.
	5. **Archaisms and Informal/Formal Mix**:
		- Mix of formal (e.g., "veritable") and informal ("you have, before, below, and around you") language.
