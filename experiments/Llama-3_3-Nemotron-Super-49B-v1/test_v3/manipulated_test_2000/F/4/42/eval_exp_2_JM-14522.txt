**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **Rating:** 4
* **Issues Affecting Rating:**
  * **Grammar and Verb Tense Consistency:** Numerous instances of incorrect verb tense usage (e.g., "had been spilt", "was removed", "have fallen", "woulded did it", "have seen", "am removed") and subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the twins... am usually called").
  * **Punctuation:** Occasional lack of commas for clarity in long sentences, and inconsistent use of quotation marks for dialogue (though mostly consistent).
  * **Word Choice/Redundancy:** A few instances of slightly archaic or less common vocabulary might hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "receptive expectations", "sanguineous"), but overall enriches the text.
  * **Sentence Construction:** Generally varied and effective, contributing to a smooth read despite the aforementioned errors.

### **Coherence**

* **Rating:** 5
* **Issues Affecting Rating:**
  * **None Significant:** The narrative is well-structured, with a clear introduction to the setting and characters, a build-up of the paranormal elements, and a logical flow from one event to the next. Transitions between scenes are smooth, and the story's themes and tones are consistently maintained.
  * **Strengths:**
    - Effective use of foreshadowing (e.g., the blood stain, Mrs. Umney's warnings).
    - Clear character establishment (e.g., Mr. Otis's skepticism, Washington's practicality).
    - Logical progression of the ghost's appearances and the family's reactions.
