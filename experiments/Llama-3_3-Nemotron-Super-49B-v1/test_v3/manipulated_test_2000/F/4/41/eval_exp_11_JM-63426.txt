**Assessment with Issues**

### **Coherence (Organization and Logical Flow)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Clear structure with two distinct chapters focusing on different aspects of Will Bradley's life.
	+ Each chapter has a discernible narrative arc.
* **Weaknesses/Issues:**
	1. **Abrupt Transition Between Chapters**: The shift from the introductory chapter to "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" feels abrupt without a transitional phrase or sentence connecting the biographical introduction to the detailed childhood narrative.
	2. **Information Density in Chapter 2**: The second chapter packs a high volume of specific, detailed events from Bradley's childhood, which, while engaging, can feel overwhelming due to the rapid succession of vignettes without clear thematic linking beyond chronological progression.
	3. **Minor Tangents (e.g., the detailed description of the faker selling soap)**: While colorful, some anecdotes feel slightly tangential to the main narrative thrust of Bradley's development as an artist/designer.

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Grammar)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Engaging, vivid prose with effective use of descriptive language.
	+ Generally clear sentence structure.
* **Weaknesses/Issues:**
1. **Typos and Minor Errors**:
	* "seem" instead of "seen" (Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION)
	* "toom" instead of "room" (Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION)
	* "werebknown" (likely "were known")
	* "therecderivative" (likely "there were derivative")
	* "om" instead of "on" (multiple instances)
	* "rethrn" instead of "return"
	* "prss" instead of "press" (multiple instances)
	* "qant" instead of "want"
	* "esucation" instead of "education"
	* "boardcand" instead of "board and"
	* "isbalways" instead of "is always"
	* Punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or incorrect commas)
2. **Sentence Complexity Variability**: Some sentences are simple and direct, while others are long and complex, creating a slightly uneven reading flow.
3. **Archaisms and Assumed Knowledge**:
	* References (e.g., "Yelpow Book", specific historical figures/events) might require additional context for some readers.
	* Archaisms ("cemts" for cents
