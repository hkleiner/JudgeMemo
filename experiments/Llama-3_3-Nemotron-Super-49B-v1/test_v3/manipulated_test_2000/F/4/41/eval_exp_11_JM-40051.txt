**Assessment with Issues**

### **Coherence (Organization and Logical Flow)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ The text has a clear overall structure (introduction, description, location, biblical connections, conclusion).
	+ Attempts to logically connect the discovered location with biblical descriptions of the Garden of Eden.
* **Weaknesses (Issues Affecting Score):**
	1. **Abrupt Transitions**: Sudden shifts between describing the garden's beauty, biblical references, and personal anecdotes (e.g., from describing the garden's layout to talking about the greed of original proprietors).
	2. **Lack of Clear Thesis Statement**: The central argument (this location is the Garden of Eden) is not strongly asserted at the outset, making the text's purpose unclear until later.
	3. **Tangents**: Inclusion of unnecessary details (e.g., the etymology of "La Crosse," detailed descriptions of lumber mills) that detract from the main argument.
	4. **Assumed Knowledge**: Assumes a deep understanding of biblical references and geographical locations without sufficient context for all readers.
	5. **Conclusion Feels Abrupt**: The text ends somewhat suddenly without a strong summarizing statement reinforcing the main claim.

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Grammar)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Generally, sentences are structured to convey complex ideas.
	+ Rich vocabulary used to describe landscapes.
* **Weaknesses (Issues Affecting Score):**
	1. **Complex, Overly Long Sentences**: Many sentences are too long and convoluted, hindering easy understanding (e.g., the entire paragraph starting with "It is located on the 'eastward bank'...").
	2. **Grammar and Punctuation Errors**:
		- Missing or misplaced commas for clarity.
		- Examples: "antldiluvians" (likely "antediluvians"), "princopak" (unclear), "cohsequently" (should be "consequently"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "prlper" (should be "proper"), "inhabitant of all the earth? Not too far north, not too far south." (lacks connecting punctuation or clearer transition).
	3. **Redundancy**: Some ideas or descriptions are repeated without adding new insight.
	4. **Archaisms and Formality**: The highly formal tone and use of archaic expressions ("thou,"
