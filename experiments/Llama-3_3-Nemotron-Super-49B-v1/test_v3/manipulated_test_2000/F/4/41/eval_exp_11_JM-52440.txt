**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency Assessment**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Complex ideas are generally well-articulated.
	+ Vocabulary is rich and appropriate for a theological text.
* **Weaknesses (Affecting Fluency Score):**
	+ **Typos and Minor Errors:** Numerous typos (e.g., "unvommon", "srrvice", "worstesablisjed", "tue", "prssent", "wnd", "vby", "ln", "tye", "kt", "generak", "momen") distract from the reading experience.
	+ **Sentence Length and Complexity:** Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially confusing readers (e.g., the paragraph starting with "The practical conclusion...").
	+ **Redundancy:** Some points are repeated in slightly different wording without adding new insight (e.g., the distinction between the sign and the thing signified is explained multiple times).
	+ **Transition Smoothness:** Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother; the flow from discussing Scripture to examining Church documents feels somewhat abrupt.

### **Coherence Assessment**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Clear objective stated at the outset.
	+ Logical progression from introducing the controversy to planning the examination of Church documents.
* **Weaknesses (Affecting Coherence Score):**
	+ **Scope Clarity:** The text sometimes blurs the line between what is being proven (Church of England's doctrine) and the author's beliefs (e.g., the personal belief about St. John's chapter).
	+ **Forecasting of Structure:** While the three principal points are introduced, the text could benefit from a clearer outline of how the rest of the document will address these points beyond the immediate next step.
	+ **Integration of Examples:** The transition to discussing the Articles could be more seamlessly integrated into the overall argument flow.
	+ **Assumption of Prior Knowledge:** Assumes a high level of familiarity with theological debates and specific Church documents without introduction.
