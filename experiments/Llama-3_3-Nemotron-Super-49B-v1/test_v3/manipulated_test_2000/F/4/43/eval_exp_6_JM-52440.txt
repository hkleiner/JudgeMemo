**Assessment of the Text's Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings (Bulleted Points)**

#### **Fluency:**
- **Complex Sentence Structures:** Frequent use of long, complex sentences can hinder smooth reading.
- **Archaic Language and Vocabulary:** Utilization of outdated terms (e.g., "thou", "thee", implied but not directly used here, yet the overall tone is formal and somewhat antiquated) may reduce readability for modern readers.
- **Redundancy:** Some ideas are repeated in slightly different wording without adding new insight.
- **Abrupt Transition (Chapter to Detailed Analysis):** The shift from the introduction to the deep dive into "The Real Presence" could be smoother.
- **Typos/Grammatical Errors:** Identified in the provided text, e.g., "the the" (repeated articles), suggesting a need for proofreading.

#### **Coherence:**
- **Clear Structure:** The text is well-organized with a clear introduction, objective statement, and a methodical approach to the topic.
- **However,**
  - **Assumed Knowledge:** The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and biblical references, which might confuse less informed readers.
  - **Depth of Dive:** The immediate deep dive into the nuances of "The Real Presence" without a broader contextual setup for all readers might affect coherence for those not well-versed in the subject.

### **Detailed Ratings with Justifications**

#### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
- **Justification:** The text is highly coherent in its structure and the logical flow of ideas within each section. However, the assumption of extensive background knowledge and the abrupt depth of theological discussion might reduce coherence for a broader audience.

#### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
- **Justification:** While the text is readable, its fluency is impacted by complex sentence structures, the potential for modern readers to find the language somewhat archaic, redundancy in expressing certain points, and the presence of minor errors. These factors make the text less than perfectly fluent for a general audience.
