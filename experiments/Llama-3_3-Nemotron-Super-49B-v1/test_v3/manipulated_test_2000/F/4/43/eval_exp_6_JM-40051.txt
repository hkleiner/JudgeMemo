**Assessment with Issues**

### **Coherence (Organization and Logical Flow)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ The text has a clear central claim (identifying a location as the Garden of Eden).
	+ Attempts to connect biblical descriptions with the described location.
* **Weaknesses and Issues:**
	1. **Non-linear Narrative**: The text jumps between personal anecdote, biblical interpretation, geographical description, and defensive positioning against potential critics, disrupting the flow.
	2. **Lack of Clear Structure**: No discernible introduction-body-conclusion format; ideas and sections feel loosely connected.
	3. **Abrupt Transitions**: For example, the shift from describing the garden's beauty to warning about snakes feels sudden and unprepared.
	4. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: Assertions about the location being the Garden of Eden are not rigorously supported with credible evidence beyond personal impression and selective biblical interpretation.
	5. **Tangents**: Discussions about city names, lumber mills, and the contrast with other natural wonders (e.g., Yosemite) distract from the main argument.

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Grammar)**

* **Strengths:**
	+ Generally understandable vocabulary.
	+ Enthusiasm for the subject is palpable, which can engage the reader.
* **Weaknesses and Issues:**
1. **Complex, Winding Sentences**: Many sentences are long and convoluted, hindering easy comprehension.
2. **Grammar and Punctuation Errors**:
	* Example: "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," (appears to be a jumbled, unreadable sentence).
	* Missing or misplaced commas and periods in several places.
3. **Redundancy**: Phrases and ideas are repeated without adding new insight (e.g., the beauty of the location).
4. **Archaic Language**: Use of outdated phrases ("antldiluvians", "antideluvians", "scientest" instead of "scientist") may confuse or alienate some readers.
5. **Lack of Conciseness**: Wordiness in descriptions ("surpasses my power of adequate description" could be more succinct).
