**Assessment of the Text's Quality**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings (Bulleted Points)**

#### **Fluency:**
- **Lengthy Sentences**: Many sentences are excessively long, potentially hindering smooth reading (e.g., the first sentence of Chapter I).
- **Complex Vocabulary**: Utilization of somewhat archaic or highly formal language (e.g., "wheresoever", "invisibly bestows") might reduce readability for a broad audience.
- **Redundancy**: Some ideas are repeated in slightly different wording without adding significant new insight (e.g., the distinction between the sign and the thing signified is explained multiple times).
- **Lack of Transitional Phrases**: Abrupt transitions between paragraphs or ideas, particularly when shifting from Scripture interpretation to Church of England documents.

#### **Coherence:**
- **Clear Structure**: The text is well-organized, with a logical flow from introduction to the exploration of specific doctrines.
- **Well-Defined Objectives**: The author clearly states the purpose and scope of the inquiry.
- **However**:
  - **Assumed Knowledge**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Christian theology, the Church of England's structure, and specific biblical references, which might confuse less informed readers.
  - **Depth Over Breadth in Explanation**: While the central argument is well-supported, the depth of analysis on certain points (e.g., the distinction between the Church of England and Rome) might overshadow the broader coherence for readers seeking a more balanced overview.

### **Final Scores**

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
*Rationale: The text excels in logical structure and clear objectives. However, the assumption of extensive background knowledge and the intense focus on specific theological nuances slightly detract from its overall coherence for a broader audience.*

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 3  
*Rationale: While the text is formally written, the lengthy sentences, complex vocabulary, redundancy, and lack of transitional phrases significantly impact its readability and flow, reducing its fluency score.*
