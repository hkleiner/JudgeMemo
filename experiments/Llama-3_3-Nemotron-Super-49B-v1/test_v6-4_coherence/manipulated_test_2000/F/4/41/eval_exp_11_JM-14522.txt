Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, non-essential descriptions (e.g., family's conversation topics in Chapter II) slightly detract from the main storyline.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the family's daily activities to the ghost's appearance at night without a smooth lead-in.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
