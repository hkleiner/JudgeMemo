Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the Introduction and Chapter: THE STORY without a clear connecting summary or bridge.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" may confuse readers without a visual aid or simpler explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analytical discussion in the Introduction to immersive storytelling in "THE STORY" without a transitional paragraph.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
