Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures and lengthy paragraphs may hinder smooth understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's teachings to diving into the specifics of the Real Presence doctrine without a clear transitional phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between addressing the reader, setting up the investigation, and delving into theological comparisons without a consistently clear flow.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
