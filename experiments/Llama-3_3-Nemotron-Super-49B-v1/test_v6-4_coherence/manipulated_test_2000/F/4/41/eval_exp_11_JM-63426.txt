Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear connecting narrative or thematic bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of Will Bradley's impact and his design style).
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", transitions between different time periods or events could be smoother, with clearer temporal markers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
