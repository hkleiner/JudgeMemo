Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context (Introduction) and story analysis (The Story) without a clear connecting paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in the Introduction, potentially hindering smooth understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Dickens's health and writing style to analyzing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a transitional sentence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
