Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and story analysis (e.g., sudden shift from discussing Dickens' health to introducing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" plot)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures and lengthy paragraphs hindering easy comprehension
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between chapters ("INTRODUCTION" to "THE STORY") and within sections (e.g., from character introductions to plot openings)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions without clear evidence (e.g., implications about character relationships without direct textual support from "Edwin Drood")

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
