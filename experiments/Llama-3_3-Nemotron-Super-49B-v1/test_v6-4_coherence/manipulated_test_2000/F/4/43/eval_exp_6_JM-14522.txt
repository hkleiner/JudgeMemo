Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" without clear sectioning or title consistency.
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained shift in narrative tone and style in the "CHAPTER: nothing" section.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the family's daily activities and the ghost's appearance, making the encounter feel somewhat disconnected.
