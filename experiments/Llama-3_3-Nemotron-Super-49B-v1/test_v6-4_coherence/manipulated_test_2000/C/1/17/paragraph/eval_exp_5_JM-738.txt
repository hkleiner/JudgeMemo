Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Dickens's writing style to a personal Christmas memory without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in the introduction hinder immediate understanding of the topic's focus (Edwin Drood).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analyzing Dickens's approach to storytelling to introducing the author's (Andrew Lang's) analysis of Edwin Drood without a smooth bridge.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between critique of Dickens's later works, a personal anecdote, and then a deep dive into Edwin Drood's characters and plot, causing disjointedness.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
