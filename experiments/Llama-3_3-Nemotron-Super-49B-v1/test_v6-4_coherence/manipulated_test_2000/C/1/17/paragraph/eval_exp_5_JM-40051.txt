Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Jasper & Rosa, Mrs. Umney, George Stransom) disrupting the main Eden discovery narrative.
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose and dense paragraphs hindering easy understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between vastly different scenes and topics.
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking the Mississippi to the Bible's Euphrates without clear evidence) and leaps in reasoning.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
