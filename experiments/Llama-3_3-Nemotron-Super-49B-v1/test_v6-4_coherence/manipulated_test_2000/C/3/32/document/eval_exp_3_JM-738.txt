Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and story analysis (e.g., sudden shift from Dickens's health to character introductions)
- [CLARITY] Overuse of unspecified terms (e.g., "a stuff", "a thing") causing confusion
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., from opium den description to character relationships)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
