Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering smooth understanding (e.g., descriptions of family members).
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the blood stain to the family's evening drive feels somewhat disconnected.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
