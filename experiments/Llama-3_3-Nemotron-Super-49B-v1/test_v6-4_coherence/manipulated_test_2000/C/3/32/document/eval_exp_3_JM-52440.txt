Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy paragraphs without clear subsections within chapters, potentially hindering flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are convoluted, requiring re-reading for understanding (e.g., explanations of "the thing" and its distinctions).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Scripture and doctrinal beliefs to announcing the examination of the Church of England's documents without a smooth connector.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
