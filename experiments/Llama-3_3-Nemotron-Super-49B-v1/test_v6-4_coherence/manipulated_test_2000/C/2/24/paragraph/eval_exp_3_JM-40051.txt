Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and geographical description without clear linking.
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate and poetic descriptions hinder concise understanding of the Garden of Eden's location and features.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from describing the garden's beauty to mentioning snakes and then to the impact of Christianity, disrupting flow.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's characteristics (e.g., lack of mineral wealth) are not clearly justified or connected to biblical text.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
