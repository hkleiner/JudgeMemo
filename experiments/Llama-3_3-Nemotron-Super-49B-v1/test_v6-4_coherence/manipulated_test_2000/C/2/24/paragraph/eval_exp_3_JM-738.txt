Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and story analysis (e.g., "A cloud upload completed." and "The digital assistant logged the entry." disrupt flow)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships introduction without clear relevance to the main plot question
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from author's intentions discussion to character list ("DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" feels disconnected)
- [LOGIC] Unexplained or assumed knowledge (e.g., significance of "The Signalman" reference without context)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
