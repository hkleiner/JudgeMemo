Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter: AN INTRODUCTION and CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING (no clear link or indication of a shift in narrative focus)
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, anecdotal narrative in "THE BOY PRINTER" may confuse readers regarding its relevance to the introduction's thesis on Will Bradley's impact
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences connecting paragraphs within chapters, especially in "THE BOY PRINTER" where scenes shift rapidly

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
