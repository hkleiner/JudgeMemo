Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of unrelated modern elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather", "A bluetooth signal was detected", "A surveillance camera moved slightly") disrupts the historical narrative's coherence.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering smooth understanding (e.g., the description of Mrs. Otis and the family's discussion topics).
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter I to Chapter II could be smoother, with a more explicit connection between the events of the two chapters.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
