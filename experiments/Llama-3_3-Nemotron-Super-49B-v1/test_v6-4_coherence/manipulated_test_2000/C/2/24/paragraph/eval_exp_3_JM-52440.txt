Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between philosophical/theological discussions and unrelated technological phrases ("The voice recognition module powered up", "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb", "The biosensor updated its readout").
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs that may hinder smooth understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between the introduction of a topic and its detailed analysis (e.g., moving from general assertions about the Church of England to specific scriptural analysis).

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
