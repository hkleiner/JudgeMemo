Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context (Dickens' life) and story analysis (e.g., from discussing Dickens' health to introducing _Edwin Drood_ characters without a clear link).
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory (e.g., the extensive history of Mr. Bud, Mr. Drood, and their families) that may confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analytical introduction (signed by Andrew Lang) to "CHAPTER: THE STORY" without a transitional phrase or sentence, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [LOGIC] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge of Dickens' works and characters (e.g., _Bleak House_, _Pickwick_, _Nicholas Nickleby_) without brief context, which might alienate unfamiliar readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
