Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery narrative
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language obscures main argument at times
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between sections (e.g., from description of Eden's characteristics to its supposed location)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly logically connected to biblical evidence

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
