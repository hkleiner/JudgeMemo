Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, non-essential descriptions (e.g., family's conversation topics in Chapter II) slightly detract from the main narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in tone and subject (e.g., from ghostly events to discussing actresses and food preferences) without smooth transitions.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
