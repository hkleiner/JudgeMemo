Evaluation Form:

1) **Coherence Issues:**
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between life stages and topics without clear transitional phrases.
  - [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions of historical context and personal anecdotes that sometimes obscure the main narrative thread.
  - [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, making the text feel like a collection of loosely connected memoir excerpts.
  - [LOGIC] Some sections (e.g., the detailed description of 1890s fashion in "THE GAY NINETIES") feel tangential to the overall story of Will Bradley's life and career.

2) **FINAL Coherence Score:** **3.5**
