Evaluation Form:

1) **Coherence Issues:**
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between life events and thematic discussions.
  - [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed fashion descriptions in "The Gay Nineties") that slow the narrative pace.
  - [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, making the text feel like a collection of loosely connected essays.
  - [LOGIC] Some paragraphs seem out of place or lack a clear connection to the surrounding content (e.g., the detailed description of the snowstorm in "Second Sojourn in Chicago").

2) **FINAL Coherence Score:** **3.5**
