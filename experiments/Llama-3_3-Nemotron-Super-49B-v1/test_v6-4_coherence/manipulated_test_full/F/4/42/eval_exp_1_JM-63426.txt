Evaluation Form:

1) **Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] **Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps** between chapters without clear transitional links, making the overall flow disjointed.
- [CLARITY] **Overly detailed, verbose descriptions** in some sections (e.g., descriptive passages of settings and attire) that detract from the main narrative thread.
- [TRANSITION] **Lack of clear chronological markers** between some chapters, requiring the reader to infer time jumps.
- [LOGIC] **Unconnected anecdotes** (e.g., the detailed story about Mr. Newett and the faker) that, while illustrative, feel tangential to the broader coherence of Bradley's professional journey.

2) **FINAL Coherence Score:** **3.5**
