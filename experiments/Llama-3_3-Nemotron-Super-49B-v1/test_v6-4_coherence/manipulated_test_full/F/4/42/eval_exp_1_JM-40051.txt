Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages, biblical analysis, and personal anecdotes without clear connecting links.
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions and repetitive assertions (e.g., the garden's beauty and uniqueness) that obscure key points.
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., the garden's exemption from cyclones, its identification as the Garden of Eden) lacking robust evidence or logical progression.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
