Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent character behavior (e.g., Grewgious's reactions to Jasper)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., between chapters and subplots)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex plot twists (e.g., Datchery's identity, quicklime details)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear timeline and character motivations (e.g., Grewgious's actions post-Edwin's disappearance)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
