Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes (e.g., sudden shifts from narrative to philosophical musings unrelated to the plot)
- [CLARITY] Unnecessary and lengthy descriptions of unrelated historical events (e.g., the detailed account of Lord Stainville and Madame de Choiseul-Romanet)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between the ghost's narrative and the main plot (e.g., the ghost's internal monologues feel disconnected)
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent character behaviors and reactions (e.g., the family's casual response to the ghost's presence after initial frights)
- [STRUCTURE] Inclusion of seemingly irrelevant texts (e.g., the passage about animal adaptation and the excerpt about Jasper and Helena)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
