Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biblical analysis, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs hinder easy understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between sections (e.g., sudden shift from Garden of Eden description to a quote about tramps).
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., garden size, location logic) not fully supported by presented evidence.
- [STRUCTURE] Inclusion of seemingly unrelated texts (e.g., the passage about George Stransom, the snippet about killing the landlord) disrupts coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
