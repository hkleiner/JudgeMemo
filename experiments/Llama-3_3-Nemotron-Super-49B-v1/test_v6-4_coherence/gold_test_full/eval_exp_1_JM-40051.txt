Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive sections, biblical analysis, and personal anecdotes without clear connecting phrases.
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions and repetitive assertions ("Come and see!") that obscure the central claim.
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., natural protection from cyclones) and lack of clear evidence linking the described location to the Garden of Eden beyond speculative interpretation.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
