1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing the Catechism to the Communion Service).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and lengthy sentences, potentially hindering comprehension for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear summaries or transitional statements between chapters (e.g., from Chapter I to Chapter II), making the flow somewhat disjointed.
