**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Grammar, Syntax, Lexicon, Clarity)**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: Occasional comma splices and lack of commas in complex sentences (e.g., "I have no secrets from you. Yes, you have" could benefit from a comma after "you" for clarity).
2. **[SYNTAX]**: Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the description of the ghost's appearance in Chapter II).
3. **[LEXICON]**: While the vocabulary is rich and often delightful, some words might be less familiar to modern readers (e.g., "rictus," "gibber," "tessellated"), potentially slowing reading.
4. **[CLARITY]**: A few transitions between paragraphs or scenes could be smoother (e.g., the shift from the ghost's internal monologue to the family's search for Virginia).
5. **[STRUCTURE]**: The narrative structure is largely linear and clear, but some chapters feel slightly disconnected from the immediate plot progression (e.g., Chapter IV's focus on the ghost's daily struggles).

### **Coherence (Logical Flow, Transitions, Idea Connection)**

1. **[LOGIC]**: The ghost's character development and motivations are well-explored, but the sudden depth in his emotional vulnerability (especially in Chapter V) might feel slightly abrupt to some readers.
2. **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between the ghost's attempts to scare the family and the family's daily life are generally well-handled, but could occasionally be more seamless.
3. **[STRUCTURE]**: The overall narrative arc is coherent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the subplot with the young Duke's pursuit and the final wedding feels somewhat tacked on for a perfectly cohesive flow.
4. **[CLARITY]**: The prophecy's meaning and its fulfillment are clear by the end, but the process of understanding could be more gradually revealed for enhanced suspense or clarity.

### **Final Scores**

**FINAL Coherence Score:** **4**
- **Rationale:** The narrative is largely well-structured, with a clear arc. However, minor issues with character depth introduction and subplot integration deduct from a perfect score.

**FINAL Fluency Score:** **4**
- **Rationale:** The text is rich in vocabulary and generally clear, but occasional grammatical, synt
