**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

#### **Issues Affecting Fluency:**

1. **[SYNTAX]** **Overly Complex Sentence Structures**: Many sentences are excessively long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading. (e.g., the first paragraph of Chapter I)
2. **[LEXICON]** **Archaic Vocabulary and Phrasing**: Use of outdated language (e.g., "whilst", "thou", in quoted material not set apart clearly from the author's voice) may confuse modern readers.
3. **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]** **Inconsistent Quotation Formatting**: Quoted texts are not consistently set apart (e.g., sometimes integrated into the text without clear differentiation).
4. **[CLARITY]** **Redundancy**: Some points are repeated without significant addition of clarity or depth (e.g., the emphasis on the Church of England's stance against transubstantiation).
5. **[STRUCTURE]** **Lack of Transitional Phrases Between Chapters**: The transition from discussing one aspect (e.g., Real Presence) to the next (e.g., Adoration, Sacrifice) could be smoother.

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized, connected, and built upon, including logical flow, clarity of transitions, and avoidance of abrupt shifts.

#### **Issues Affecting Coherence:**

1. **[STRUCTURE]** **Non-Linear Argument Development**: At times, the argument jumps back to previously discussed points without clear necessity or transition (e.g., repeated references to the Church of England's documents without a clear build-up).
2. **[LOGIC]** **Assumed Knowledge**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the doctrines in question and the historical context of the Church of England's reforms.
3. **[TRANSITION]** **Abrupt Shifts in Focus**: Moving from doctrinal analysis to addressing the state of the Church of England and back could be more seamlessly integrated.
4. **[CLARITY]** **Overly Broad Conclusions from Specific Examples**: Generalizations about the Church of England's teachings are drawn from specific document analyses without always clarifying the representativeness of these examples.
5. **[STRUCTURE]** **Lengthy Chapters Without Clear Subsections**: Breaking down long chapters into themed subsections could enhance
