**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency (Clarity, Grammar, Syntax, Lexicon, Clarity)**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: Minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing or misplaced commas, inconsistent use of quotation marks) throughout the text, but not frequent enough to severely impact readability.
   
2. **[SYNTAX]**: Occasionally complex sentence structures may slow down the reader, but they are generally well-managed and contribute to the narrative's Victorian style.

3. **[LEXICON]**: Rich and appropriate vocabulary for a late 19th-century narrative. No significant redundancy noted.

4. **[CLARITY]**: The text is mostly clear, but some long, descriptive paragraphs could be broken up for modern readers' comfort.

### **Coherence (Logic, Structure, Transitions)**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The chapter structure is clear and effective. However, within chapters, some scenes feel slightly disconnected without clear transitional phrases.

2. **[LOGIC]**: The narrative's logic holds, even with its supernatural elements, due to consistent rules within the story's world.

3. **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between scenes or days could be smoother with more explicit connectors or summary transitions.

4. **[CLARITY]** (Overarching): The story's progression and character motivations are generally clear, though the ghost's immediate emotional shifts could be more subtly transitioned.

| [CLARITY] | Paragraph Length | Long descriptive paragraphs |
| [STRUCTURE] | Intra-Chapter Flow | Slightly disconnected scenes without clear transitions |

### **Final Scores**

- **Rationale:** The narrative is well-structured at a chapter level, with a logical storyline. However, transitions
