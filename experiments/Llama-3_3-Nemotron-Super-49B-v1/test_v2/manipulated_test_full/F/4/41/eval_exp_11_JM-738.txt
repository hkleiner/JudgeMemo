**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

| **Issue** | **Tag** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Overly Complex Sentences** | [SYNTAX] | Numerous sentences are excessively long and convoluted, hindering easy understanding. |
| 2. **Archaisms and Formal Language** | [LEXICON] | Use of outdated terms (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "doth") and overly formal tone may alienate modern readers. |
| 3. **Repetitive Analysis** | [STRUCTURE] | Repeated analysis of the same plot points (e.g., Datchery's identity, Jasper's guilt) without significant new insights. |
| 4. **Lack of Clear Transitions** | [TRANSITION] | Abrupt shifts between discussing the story, analyzing characters, and presenting theories without smooth transitions. |
| 5. **Minor Grammar/Punctuation Errors** | [GRAMMAR] | Occasional errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect comma usage) though not prevalent. |

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized, connected, and build upon each other, including logical flow, clarity of transitions, and avoidance of abrupt shifts.

| **Issue** | **Tag** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Non-Linear Presentation of Theories** | [STRUCTURE] | Theories and analyses are presented in a non-chronological and sometimes confusing manner. |
| 2. **Unclear Stance on Key Mysteries** | [CLARITY] | The text often fails to clearly state its stance on central mysteries (e.g., Edwin's fate, Datchery's identity) amidst multiple theories. |
| 3. **Overemphasis on Disproving Other Theories** | [LOGIC] | More space is dedicated to refuting other scholars' theories than to cohesively presenting the text's own argument. |
| 4. **Assumed Prior Knowledge** | [CLARITY] | Assumes readers are deeply familiar with Dickens' works and the context of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without sufficient background provision. |
| 5. **Conclusion Feels Rushed** | [STRUCT
