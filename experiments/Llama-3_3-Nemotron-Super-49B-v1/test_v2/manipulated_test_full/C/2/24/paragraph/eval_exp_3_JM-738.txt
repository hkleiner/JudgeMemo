**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Tag** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Complex Sentence Structures** | Frequently, sentences are overly complex, making them hard to follow. | [SYNTAX] |
| 2. **Lengthy Paragraphs** | Paragraphs are excessively long, hindering easy reading. | [STRUCTURE] |
| 3. **Archaic Language and References** | Uses outdated language (e.g., "thou", "thee") and assumes knowledge of old references (e.g., specific literary works, historical events) without explanation. | [LEXICON] |
| 4. **Repetitive Explanations** | Some points (e.g., theories about Datchery's identity) are repeated without significant new insight. | [LEXICON] |
| 5. **Abrupt Transitions** | Transitions between different theories or sections can be abrupt. | [TRANSITION] |
| 6. **Minor Grammar/Punctuation Errors** | Occasional errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect comma usage). | [GRAMMAR] |

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized, connected, and build upon each other.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Tag** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Non-Linear Presentation of Theories** | Theories about the mystery are presented in a non-linear fashion, confusing the narrative flow. | [STRUCTURE] |
| 2. **Lack of Clear Thesis Statement** | The text lacks an upfront, clear thesis on the author's stance regarding the mystery. | [CLARITY] |
| 3. **Overemphasis on Disproving Other Theories** | More space is dedicated to critiquing other theories than to cohesively presenting the author's own. | [LOGIC] |
| 4. **Assumed Knowledge of the Original Story** | Readers without prior knowledge of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" may struggle due to unexplained references. | [CLARITY] |
| 5. **Unresolved Speculations** | Some speculations (e.g., about characters' backstories) are left without a clear connection to the main mystery
