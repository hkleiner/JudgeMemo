**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

#### **Issues Affecting Fluency:**

1. **[SYNTAX]** Overly complex and lengthy sentences, making comprehension challenging. (e.g., the first paragraph of the Introduction)
2. **[LEXICON]** Repetitive use of similar phrases for emphasis (e.g., "it is... that"), which, while effective in sermons, can feel redundant in written text.
3. **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]** Occasional lack of clarity in comma usage, potentially leading to slight pauses in reading flow.
4. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences assume prior knowledge of specific theological debates or documents (e.g., "the Articles"), which might confuse unfamiliar readers.
5. **[TRANSITION]** Transitions between chapters could be smoother; the shift from discussing the Real Presence to Adoration feels somewhat abrupt.

#### **Fluency Score:** 4

*Rationale:* Despite the identified issues, the text is generally well-written, with clear language and effective use of rhetorical questions. The complexity and length of sentences, while challenging, contribute to a formal, scholarly tone appropriate for the subject matter.

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized, connected, and built upon, including logical flow, clarity of transitions, and avoidance of abrupt shifts.

#### **Issues Affecting Coherence:**

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text could benefit from a brief overview or roadmap at the beginning to guide the reader through the three main chapters (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice).
2. **[LOGIC]** Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with the controversy's history and key documents (e.g., the Articles of the Church of England).
3. **[TRANSITION]** As mentioned, transitions between main topics (chapters) are not fully developed.
4. **[CLARITY]** The conclusion, while heartfelt, somewhat repeats the introduction without fully synthesizing the findings in a concise manner.
5. **[STRUCTURE]** Embedded anecdotes (e.g., the experience in church) and the deepfake filter example at the end feel somewhat out of place or underexplained in the otherwise formal analysis.

#### **Coherence Score:** 4

*Rationale:* The text is well-organized within each chapter, with a clear argumentative
