**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Tag** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Archaisms and Formality** | The text's highly formal, somewhat archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee", less common vocabulary) may hinder readability for modern readers. | LEXICON |
| 2. **Long, Complex Sentences** | Several sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially causing confusion. | SYNTAX |
| 3. **Repetitive Descriptions** | Repeated descriptions of characters' reactions (e.g., the family's amusement at the ghost's antics) could be more varied. | LEXICON |
| 4. **Minor Grammar/Punctuation** | A few instances of missing or misplaced commas, and one noticeable error ("a thing" used inconsistently, apparently as a placeholder). | GRAMMAR |
| 5. **Word Choice Consistency** | Inconsistent use of "a thing" (seems to be a placeholder for various nouns, distracting the reader). | LEXICON |

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized and connected, including logical flow, transitions, and consistency.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Tag** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Chapter Transitions** | Transitions between chapters could be smoother; the narrative jumps abruptly at times. | TRANSITION |
| 2. **Subplot Introduction** | The introduction of the young Duke of Cheshire feels somewhat abrupt and not fully integrated into the main narrative until later. | STRUCTURE |
| 3. **Ghost's Character Development** | While engaging, the ghost's depth and motivations could be more consistently developed throughout. | LOGIC |
| 4. **Pacing** | The narrative pace varies significantly, with some chapters feeling rushed and others detailed. | STRUCTURE |
| 5. **Resolution Clarity** | The final resolution, while poetic, might leave some readers wondering about the exact nature of Virginia's experience with the ghost. | CLARITY |
