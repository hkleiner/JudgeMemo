**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency (Clarity, Readability, Grammar, Syntax, Lexicon)**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: Occasional archaic sentence structures (e.g., "I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him") might confuse modern readers, but are consistent with the narrative's Victorian style.
   
2. **[SYNTAX]**: Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., the entire first paragraph of Chapter I) can hinder readability but are characteristic of the period's literary writing.

3. **[LEXICON]**: Utilization of a rich, sometimes archaic vocabulary (e.g., "punctilious", "gibber", "thixotropy" implied but not directly used) enhances the narrative's Victorian ambiance but may require occasional dictionary checks for some readers.

4. **[CLARITY]**: The narrative's non-linear progression in some chapters (e.g., the ghost's backstory in Chapter II) is mostly clear due to contextual clues.

### **Coherence (Organization, Logical Flow, Transitions)**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The narrative jumps between the Otis family's experiences and the ghost's internal monologues/backstory. While mostly effective, transitions could be smoother in places (e.g., the shift from Chapter II to III).

2. **[TRANSITION]**: Chapter transitions are sometimes abrupt (e.g., from the intense ending of Chapter V to the funeral preparations in Chapter VI), disrupting the flow slightly.

3. **[LOGIC]**: The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., moving objects, being affected by water) while also being non-corporeal at times might confuse readers regarding the rules of the supernatural elements in the story.

4. **[COHERENCE]**: Despite the above, the overall narrative arc is clear, and the climax (Virginia's interaction with the ghost) effectively ties together the story's themes.

### **Final Scores**

**FINAL Coherence Score:** **4**
- **Rationale:** While there are minor issues with transitions between chapters and some logical inconsistencies regarding the ghost's abilities, the narrative's overall structure and the logical flow within chapters are well-maintained, leading to a coherent story arc.

**FINAL Fluency Score:** **4**
- **Rationale:** The text's fluency is high, considering its Victorian style, which might
