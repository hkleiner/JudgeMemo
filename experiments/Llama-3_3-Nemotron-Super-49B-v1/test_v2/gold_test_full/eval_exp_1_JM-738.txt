**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connections between sentences.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Tag** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Complex Sentence Structures** | Frequently, sentences are overly complex, making them hard to follow. | [SYNTAX] |
| 2. **Lengthy Paragraphs** | Paragraphs are excessively long, hindering easy reading. | [STRUCTURE] |
| 3. **Archaisms and Formal Tone** | Use of outdated language (e.g., "thou", "thee") and a very formal tone may alienate modern readers. | [LEXICON] |
| 4. **Repetitive Explanations** | Some points (e.g., theories on Datchery's identity) are repeated without significant new insight. | [LEXICON] |
| 5. **Assumed Knowledge** | The text assumes deep prior knowledge of Dickens' works and 19th-century literary context. | [CLARITY] |
| 6. **Minor Grammar/Punctuation** | Occasional minor errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect comma usage). | [GRAMMAR] |

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized, connected, and build upon each other.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Tag** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Non-Linear Presentation of Theories** | Theories on Edwin Drood's fate are presented in a non-sequential, confusing manner. | [STRUCTURE] |
| 2. **Lack of Clear Thesis Statement** | The text lacks an upfront, clear hypothesis to guide the reader. | [STRUCTURE] |
| 3. **Abrupt Transitions** | Transitions between discussing the story, analyzing characters, and presenting theories are abrupt. | [TRANSITION] |
| 4. **Unresolved Speculations** | Several speculations are left without a clear conclusion or indication of their importance. | [LOGIC] |
| 5. **Overreliance on Unsubstantiated Conjecture** | Some arguments heavily rely on unproven assumptions about Dickens' intentions. | [LOGIC] |
| 6. **Failure to Clearly Distinguish Between Theories** | Distinctions between the author
