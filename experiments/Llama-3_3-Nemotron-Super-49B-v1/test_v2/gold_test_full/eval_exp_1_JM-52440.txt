**Assessment of Text Quality**

### **Fluency**

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and logical connection between sentences.

#### **Issues Affecting Fluency:**

1. **[SYNTAX]** **Overly Complex Sentence Structures**: Many sentences are excessively long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading. (e.g., the first paragraph of Chapter I)
2. **[LEXICON]** **Redundant Phrasing**: Frequent use of redundant expressions (e.g., "it is my conviction that", "I venture to say") could be streamlined for better flow.
3. **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]** **Lack of Varied Punctuation**: The text heavily relies on periods, with limited use of commas, semicolons, or dashes to create natural pauses or separate clauses.
4. **[CLARITY]** **Assumed Knowledge**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about theological debates and specific church documents, which might confuse less informed readers.

#### **Fluency Score:** 3

### **Coherence**

Coherence evaluates how well ideas are organized and connected, including logical flow, clarity of transitions, and consistency.

#### **Issues Affecting Coherence:**

1. **[STRUCTURE]** **Non-Linear Argument Development**: While the overall structure (chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) is logical, the flow within chapters sometimes jumps between ideas without clear transitions.
2. **[TRANSITION]** **Lack of Transitional Phrases**: The absence of transitional phrases between paragraphs can make the text feel disjointed.
3. **[LOGIC]** **Assumptions in Argumentation**: Some conclusions are drawn without fully addressing potential counterarguments or providing a balanced view.
4. **[CLARITY]** **Repetitive Emphasis**: Key points are repeated multiple times, which, while emphasizing importance, disrupts the flow for readers already grasping the argument.

#### **Coherence Score:** 3.5

### **Final Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
