**Issues and Comments**

### **Fluency Issues**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," - This sentence is incomprehensible due to severe grammatical and structural errors.
   * **Impact on Fluency:** Severe disruption

2. **[SYNTAX]**: Frequent use of long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the entire paragraph starting with "This is not one solid smooth topped hill...") makes reading cumbersome.
   * **Impact on Fluency:** Significant

3. **[LEXICON]**: Overuse of superlatives ("most beautiful", "unequalled in America, and I think, in the world") without clear justification.
   * **Impact on Fluency:** Mild, contributes to a somewhat exaggerated tone

4. **[CLARITY]**: Phrases like "But possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed" are unclear.
   * **Impact on Fluency:** Severe

### **Coherence Issues**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text jumps abruptly from biblical analysis to a detailed geographical description without a smooth transition.
   * **Impact on Coherence:** Significant

2. **[TRANSITION]**: Lack of clear connectors between paragraphs, especially from the theoretical discussion to the specific location description.
   * **Impact on Coherence:** Significant

3. **[LOGIC]**: The assumption that the described location must be the Garden of Eden because it fits some biblical descriptions is presented without addressing counterarguments or alternatives.
   * **Impact on Coherence:** Mild, more related to argument strength than coherence

4. **[CLARITY]**: The purpose of the text (to convince, inform, speculate) is not clearly defined at the outset.
   * **Impact on Coherence:** Mild

### **Final Scores**

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 3  
*Rationale:* While the text has a clear overall structure (introduction, theory, location description, conclusion), the transitions between these sections are weak, and the logical flow from biblical interpretation to the specific location claim could be more cohesive. However, ideas within each section are generally well-connected.

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 2  
*Rationale:* The text is heavily impacted by at least one severely flawed sentence, numerous long and complex sentences,
