**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[GRAMMAR]**: Occasional complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers, though technically correct. (e.g., "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul;...")
* **[SYNTAX]**: Repetitive sentence starters in some paragraphs (e.g., "That the...") could vary for better flow.
* **[LEXICON]**: Archaisms ("whosoever", "doth", "thee") and formal tone, while appropriate for the subject, may reduce readability for a broad audience.
* **[CLARITY]**: A few sentences are overly long and dense, potentially causing confusion without a clear subject-verb-object flow. (e.g., The paragraph starting with "That the material food...")

### **Coherence**

* **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is well-organized, with a clear introduction, defined objectives, and a logical progression from general to specific (e.g., from the doctrine to analyzing Church documents).
* **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but the shift from discussing Scripture to focusing solely on the Church of England's documents could be more explicitly signaled.
* **[LOGIC]**: The argument's logic is clear, with a well-defined point of contention and a methodical approach to addressing it. However, the abrupt ending of the provided text (cut off in the middle of a thought on water in baptism) disrupts coherence, assuming this is not an intentional cliff for a next part.
* **[CLARITY]**: The central argument and points at issue are clearly defined, enhancing coherence.
