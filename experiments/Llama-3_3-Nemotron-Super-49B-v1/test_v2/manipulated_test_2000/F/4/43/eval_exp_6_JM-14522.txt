**Issues and Comments**

### **Fluency Issues**

1. **[SYNTAX]**: "My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..." 
   - **Comment**: This sentence is completely incoherent and seems to be a jumbled mix of words, severely impacting fluency.

2. **[LEXICON]**: "...prima reckon Old carrying very, were 'd road as our World one red-a, the your country that with painting the have a a Europe our museums best, oncome modern everything a off in a and and from have fellows young where spry home, of actors such we buy donnas show."
   - **Comment**: Similar to the first issue, this paragraph is filled with nonsensical word arrangements, hindering readability.

3. **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]**: Throughout the text, there are missing or inappropriate punctuation marks (e.g., missing commas for clarity, incorrect use of periods), though most are not explicitly listed due to their sporadic and less impactful nature compared to the syntax and lexicon issues.

### **Coherence Issues**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" is abrupt and unclear, disrupting the narrative flow.
   - **Comment**: The title "CHAPTER: nothing" is confusing and does not provide a clear indication of what the chapter entails or how it follows from the previous one.

2. **[LOGIC]**: The character's immediate reactions to supernatural events (e.g., Mr. Otis's calm response to the ghost) while consistent with the story's comedic tone, might feel implausible to some readers, potentially affecting coherence for those seeking more traditional horror responses.
   - **Comment**: This is somewhat subjective and depends on the reader's expectations, but in the context of a comedic horror tale, it largely works.

3. **[TRANSITION]**: The shift in topics during the family's conversation before the ghost's appearance (e.g., from ghosts to actresses, food, and accents) is somewhat jarring, though it serves to highlight the family's skepticism.
   - **Comment**: While somewhat jarring, this transition is intentional for character development and not a major coherence issue.
