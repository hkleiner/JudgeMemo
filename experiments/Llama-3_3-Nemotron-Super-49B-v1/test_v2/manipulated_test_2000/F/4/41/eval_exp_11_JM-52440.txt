**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[GRAMMAR]**: Multiple instances of typos (e.g., "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "srrvice", "tue", "prssent", "vow", "teachingsct", "myn", "invisibly bestows the invisible gift on tye soul") which, while not severely impacting understanding, detract from overall polish.
* **[SYNTAX]**: Occasionally complex sentence structures may slow reading flow for some readers (e.g., the first paragraph of Chapter I).
* **[LEXICON]**: Word choice is generally clear and appropriate for the theological subject matter, with no significant redundancies noted.
* **[CLARITY]**: A few phrases could benefit from clearer phrasing for broader accessibility (e.g., "the great point to be determined" could be more specifically introduced).

### **Coherence**

* **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is well-organized, with a clear introduction, defined objectives, and a logical progression from general to specific (examining Church documents).
* **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between paragraphs and from the Introduction to Chapter I are generally smooth, though a brief summary or transitional phrase linking the end of the Introduction to the start of Chapter I might enhance flow.
* **[LOGIC]**: The argument is logically presented, contrasting views before focusing on the Church of England's teachings. However, the abrupt shift from discussing Scripture in Chapter I to immediately diving into the Church's documents without a sentence bridging this methodological shift could be improved.
* **[CLARITY]**: Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents might leave some readers needing additional context.
