**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency Issues**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: "deserfed" (should be "deserted") - affects readability.
2. **[SYNTAX]**: Complex sentence structures in the introduction (e.g., "But as, in the natural changes of life...") may hinder smooth reading.
3. **[LEXICON]**: Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "seuzures", "apopldxy" - likely typos for "seizures" and "apoplexy", "ojump den" - likely "opium den") can reduce clarity.
4. **[CLARITY]**: Vague phrase "the first sprightly runnings" requires inference.
5. **[TYPOS]**: Numerous apparent typos (e.g., "ojump", "apopldxy", "seuzures", "maicen", "tjhis", "svholar", "giod", "betothal", "weird sezure", "fathedral") significantly impact fluency.

### **Coherence Issues**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: Abrupt transition from discussing Dickens's health and writing style to analyzing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
2. **[TRANSITION]**: Lack of clear connection between the introduction and the start of "The Story" chapter.
3. **[LOGIC]**: Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with Dickens's works and contemporaries (e.g., Wilkie Collins, Gaboriau) without brief context.
4. **[CLARITY]**: Character relationships and backstory (especially in "The Story" chapter) are densely packed, potentially confusing without a diagram.
5. **[STRUCTURE]**: The narrative jumps between analysis, character introduction, and story exposition without clear sectioning for ease of follow.

### **Final Scores**

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 3  
*Rationale:* While the text is generally well-organized in its parts, transitions between sections and the assumption of prior knowledge deduct from coherence. The dense character introductions also slightly impact clarity.

**FINAL Fluency Score:** 2  
*Rationale:* Despite mostly clear sentence intentions, the plethora of typos, occasional complex syntax, and less common vocabulary significantly hinder the text's overall readability and flow.
