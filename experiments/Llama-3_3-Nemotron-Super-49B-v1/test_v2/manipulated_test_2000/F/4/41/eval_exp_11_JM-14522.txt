**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[GRAMMAR]**: Multiple typos (e.g., "seej" instead of "seen", "wdll" instead of "well", "ofteb" instead of "often", "xnd" instead of "and", "vety" instead of "very", "guarfians" instead of "guardians", "waw" instead of "was", "akl" instead of "all", "nonsensd" instead of "nonsense", "simce" instead of "since", "afger" instead of "after", "tuey" instead of "they", "reavhed" instead of "reached", "Yhe" instead of "The", "evwrything" instead of "everything", "librwry" instead of "library", "Myerw" instead of "Myers", "obpong" instead of "small", "anmold" instead of "an old") throughout the text hinder smooth reading.
* **[SYNTAX]**: Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., Lord Canterville's initial explanation to Mr. Otis).
* **[LEXICON]**: Word choice is generally rich and appropriate, enhancing the narrative's Victorian-era feel. **(No deduction)**
* **[CLARITY]**: A few phrases could be clearer for modern readers unfamiliar with the period's nuances (e.g., "spry young fellows painting the Old World red").

### **Coherence**

* **[STRUCTURE]**: The narrative jumps abruptly from the family's arrival and the stain incident to Chapter II without a clear transitional phrase or sentence, slightly disrupting the flow.
* **[LOGIC]**: The character development is somewhat rushed, particularly for the children, but does not significantly impact the coherence.
* **[TRANSITION]**: The shift in focus from ghost denial to acceptance could be more smoothly transitioned, especially in Chapter II's opening.
* **[CLARITY]**: (Shared with Fluency) Some period-specific references might confuse modern readers without additional context.
