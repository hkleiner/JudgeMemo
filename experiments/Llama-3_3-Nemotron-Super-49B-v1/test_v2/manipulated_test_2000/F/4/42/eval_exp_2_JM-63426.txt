**Assessment with Issues**

### **Coherence**

* The text is largely coherent, with a clear narrative structure across two chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of Will Bradley's life.
* **[TRANSITION]**: The shift from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 feels somewhat abrupt without a transitional phrase or sentence connecting the introductory chapter to the biographical narrative. This transition could have been smoother with a sentence bridging the two chapters, such as, "From his impactful career to his humble beginnings, Bradley's life story is one of determination and innovation."
* **[LOGIC]**: In Chapter 2, the frequent changes in the narrative's timeline (e.g., moving between different ages and locations without clear temporal markers) might confuse some readers. Adding specific years or transitional phrases (e.g., "A year later," "As the seasons passed") could enhance clarity.
* **[STRUCTURE]**: While each chapter is internally coherent, the overall structure could benefit from a concluding section or final thoughts that tie both chapters together, reinforcing the significance of Bradley's life and work.

### **Fluency**

* **[GRAMMAR]**: Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "It shoulded be talked about", "was know", "don’t worked", "was thrilled", "was found", "was afforded", "are went") detract from the text's fluency. Correcting these to "should be", "were known", "didn’t work", "was thrilled", "was found", "could afford", and "went" would significantly improve readability.
* **[SYNTAX]**: Some sentences are overly complex or wordy (e.g., "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appeal to him more than any exquisite backwater."), which could be simplified for better flow.
* **[LEXICON]**: Repetitive use of certain phrases (e.g., "you was") not only contains grammatical errors but also becomes redundant. Variations in expression would enhance engagement.
* **[CLARITY]**: A few descriptions are vague (e.g., "the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man"), and while they aim to be poetic, they lack specific examples that could make the description more vivid and clear.
