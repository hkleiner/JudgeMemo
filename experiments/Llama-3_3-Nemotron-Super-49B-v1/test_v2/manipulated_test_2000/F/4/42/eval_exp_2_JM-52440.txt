**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency Issues**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "those who was loyal", "the point was supposed to had been settle", "we was taught", "the soul was fed"). 
   *Impact on Fluency:* Significant, as it disrupts the smooth reading experience.

2. **[SYNTAX]**: Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "The practical conclusion is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine.") could be simplified for better flow.
   *Impact on Fluency:* Moderate, as it may slow down the reader in some instances.

3. **[LEXICON]**: Some word choices are slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "beared", "whomsoever", "endeavoured"), which might affect readability for some readers.
   *Impact on Fluency:* Mild, as the context usually clarifies the meaning.

4. **[CLARITY]**: A few sentences are overly long or dense with complex theological concepts, potentially confusing less knowledgeable readers.
   *Impact on Fluency:* Moderate, as it requires closer attention from the reader.

### **Coherence Issues**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: While the overall structure is clear (Introduction, Chapter I, etc.), the transition from discussing Scripture to analyzing Church of England documents could be more explicitly signaled.
   *Impact on Coherence:* Mild, as the shift is generally understandable.

2. **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between paragraphs within Chapter I could be stronger to guide the reader more smoothly through the argument.
   *Impact on Coherence:* Moderate, as it slightly disrupts the narrative flow.

3. **[LOGIC]**: The assumption that the Church of England's teachings on the Lord's Supper would strictly align with its definition of sacraments (as shown through baptism) is presented as somewhat self-evident, potentially benefiting from additional justification.
   *Impact on Coherence:* Moderate, as it underpins a central argument.

4. **[CLARITY]**: The distinction between the "real objective presence" and the Reformation principles could be more succinctly summarized for clarity, especially for readers less familiar with the theological debate.
   *Impact on Coherence:* Moderate, affecting the ease of following the central argument.
