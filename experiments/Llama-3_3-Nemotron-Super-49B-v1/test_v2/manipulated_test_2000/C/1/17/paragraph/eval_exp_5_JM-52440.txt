**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency Issues**

1. **[SYNTAX]**: Abrupt transition between the introductory dialogue and the start of "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION" without a clear narrative link, disrupting the flow.
   - *Example*: The shift from "replied, ‘No, in talent and vigour.’" to "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION. Next, Jasper..." is jarring.

2. **[CLARITY]**: Overly complex sentence structures in the theological discussion sections, potentially hindering readability.
   - *Example*: "That the most precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and that the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone." (While clear in meaning to some, the structure and vocabulary might challenge less familiar readers.)

3. **[TRANSITION]**: Sudden, unannounced shift in narrative style and content from theological discussion to "The storm raged fiercely..." without any connecting element.
   - *Example*: The transition from discussing the Church of England's doctrines to a story about a ghost and a stain is completely unprepared.

4. **[LEXICON]**: Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sifting time", "sacramental appointment") that might reduce fluency for modern readers not familiar with such terms.
   - *Example*: "sifting time" might not be immediately clear to all readers.

5. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text appears to be a collage of different stories/essays without a unified structure, severely impacting overall fluency.
   - *Example*: The juxtaposition of a theological treatise, a ghost story, and a character reflection piece without connection.

### **Coherence Issues**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: Lack of a clear, overarching narrative or thematic connection between the distinct sections, leading to incoherence.
   - *Example*: The text jumps between unrelated topics (theological debate, ghost story, personal reflection) without a linking theme or narrative.

2. **[LOGIC]**: The logical flow within the theological discussion is strong, but the section's connection to the rest of the text is nonexistent, breaking overall coherence.
   - *Example*: The detailed analysis of the Real Presence doctrine does not connect to the subsequent stories.

3. **[TRANSITION]**: As mentioned, the lack of transitions between vastly different sections disrupts coherence.
   - *Same Example as in Fluency*: The unprepared shift from theology to ghost
