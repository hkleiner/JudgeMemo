**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[LEXICON]**: The text occasionally uses overly formal or less common vocabulary (e.g., "punctilious", "sanguineous", "gyves") which might slightly impede readability for some readers, though it suits the narrative's Victorian setting.
* **[SYNTAX]**: Some sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially causing minor readability issues for casual readers (e.g., the long, descriptive sentence about Mrs. Otis).
* **[CLARITY]**: The abrupt appearance of anachronistic elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather", "A surveillance camera moved slightly") disrupts the otherwise consistent Victorian-era setting, causing confusion.
* **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]**: No major issues identified.

### **Coherence**

* **[STRUCTURE]**: The narrative jumps abruptly from Chapter I to II without a clear transitional phrase or sentence, though this is somewhat mitigated by the chapter division.
* **[TRANSITION]**: The introduction of the ghost's appearance in Chapter II feels somewhat abrupt; a smoother transition from the family's skepticism to the event could enhance coherence.
* **[LOGIC]**: The character of Mr. Otis's reaction to the ghost (offering lubricant) is humorous and consistent with his character but might feel illogical or too comedic to some readers, potentially disrupting immersion.
* **[CLARITY]**: The anachronistic elements (hologram, surveillance camera) mentioned under Fluency also affect Coherence by introducing unclear, unexplained elements.
