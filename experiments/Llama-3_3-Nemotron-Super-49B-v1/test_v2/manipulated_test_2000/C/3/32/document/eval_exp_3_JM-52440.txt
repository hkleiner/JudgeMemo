**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[GRAMMAR]**: Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists, inconsistent spacing around em dashes). **Impact: Slight**
* **[SYNTAX]**: Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers. **Impact: Moderate**
* **[LEXICON]**: Formal, somewhat archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thou", implied but not directly used here, yet the tone suggests antiquity) and repetitive phrasing ("it is... that") for emphasis or transition. **Impact: Moderate**
* **[CLARITY]**: A few sentences are overly long, potentially causing reader fatigue. **Impact: Moderate**

### **Coherence**

* **[STRUCTURE]**: Clear, logical progression from introduction to focused analysis (Chapters defined, though only Introduction and Chapter I provided). **Impact: Positive**
* **[TRANSITION]**: Smooth transitions between ideas within paragraphs, but chapter transition (not fully evaluated due to only two chapters provided) seems logical. **Impact: Positive (with caveat)**
* **[LOGIC]**: Well-argued points with a clear objective, though the depth of counterargument consideration is not fully assessed in the provided text. **Impact: Positive**
* **[CLARITY]**: Clear in presenting the point at issue, but assumes a baseline understanding of theological terminology and the Church of England's documents. **Impact: Moderate (for general readers), Slight (for targeted audience)**
