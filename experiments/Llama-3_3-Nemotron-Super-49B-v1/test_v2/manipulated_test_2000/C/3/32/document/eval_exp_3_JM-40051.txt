**Issues and Comments**

### **Fluency Issues**

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: "the thing" is repeatedly used without clear reference, causing confusion. (e.g., "in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT", "THE thing.")
   - **Impact on Fluency**: High (repeated occurrences disrupt flow)
2. **[SYNTAX]**: Overly complex and long sentences, hindering easy comprehension. (e.g., the entire second paragraph)
   - **Impact on Fluency**: High (impacts readability)
3. **[LEXICON]**: Archaic language and somewhat formal tone may not engage all readers. (e.g., "antldiluvians", "thoroughly satisfied")
   - **Impact on Fluency**: Medium (may cause slight pause for some readers)
4. **[CLARITY]**: Vague references (e.g., "the plat", initially without explanation).
   - **Impact on Fluency**: Medium (initial confusion, later clarified)
5. **[SYNTAX]**: Lack of paragraph breaks for distinct ideas, leading to dense blocks of text.
   - **Impact on Fluency**: High (significantly affects readability)

### **Coherence Issues**

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: Non-linear presentation of the discovery's progression and its biblical justification.
   - **Impact on Coherence**: High (disrupts logical flow)
2. **[TRANSITION]**: Abrupt shift from biblical analysis to the geographical description without a smooth link.
   - **Impact on Coherence**: High (jarring transition)
3. **[LOGIC]**: Assumption that the described location's beauty and characteristics inherently prove it to be the Garden of Eden, without robust evidence.
   - **Impact on Coherence**: High (weakens argument's logical flow)
4. **[CLARITY]**: The term "stuff" is used ambiguously and unclearly throughout.
   - **Impact on Coherence**: High (severely impacts understanding)
5. **[STRUCTURE]**: Conclusion feels abrupt, lacking a summary of key points or a final thought on the discovery's significance.
   - **Impact on Coherence**: Medium (affects overall satisfaction)
