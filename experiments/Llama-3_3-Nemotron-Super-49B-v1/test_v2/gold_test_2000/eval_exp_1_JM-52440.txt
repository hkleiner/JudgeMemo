**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[SYNTAX]**: Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering smooth reading (e.g., the first sentence of Chapter I). 
* **[LEXICON]**: Repetitive use of "as far as I can understand them" and similar phrases could be varied for better readability.
* **[CLARITY]**: A few phrases are somewhat vague (e.g., "sifting time" in the Introduction) but generally clear in context.
* **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]**: No major errors noted; text is well-punctuated.

### **Coherence**

* **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is well-organized, with a clear introduction, defined objectives, and a logical progression through topics.
* **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between paragraphs and chapters are generally smooth, though the shift from discussing Scripture in Chapter I to immediately diving into the Church of England's documents could be slightly more seamless.
* **[LOGIC]**: The argument is logically presented, with a clear thesis and supportive analysis from Church documents.
* **[CLARITY]**: The distinction between the author's beliefs and the Church's teachings is sometimes blurred in presentation, though the intent is clear.
