**Assessment with Issues**

### **Fluency**

* **[LEXICON]**: Some vocabulary, while fitting for the period style (e.g., "punctilious", "receptive expectations"), might be less common in modern reading, potentially affecting readability for some readers. (Impact: Minor)
* **[SYNTAX]**: A few sentences are lengthy and complex, which, while well-constructed, might slow down the reading flow for some readers. (Impact: Minor)
* **[CLARITY]**: The transition between the description of the family's discussion topics (e.g., actresses, food, accents) and the sudden shift to the ghost's appearance could be smoother for better anticipation. (Impact: Moderate)
* **[GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION]**: No significant issues observed.
* **[STRUCTURE]** (within the context of fluency): The narrative's pacing is generally well-managed, with effective alternation between dialogue, description, and action.

### **Coherence**

* **[LOGIC]**: The character of Mr. Otis's immediate, pragmatic response to the ghost (offering lubricant) is consistent with his previously established skepticism and American, practical persona, thus logically coherent within the character's development. (No Issue, rather a Strength)
* **[TRANSITION]**: As mentioned under Fluency's [CLARITY], the shift to the ghost's appearance after the family's mundane discussions could benefit from a clearer transitional phrase for enhanced coherence. (Impact: Moderate)
* **[STRUCTURE]** (within the context of coherence): The narrative is well-structured, with each chapter ending on a note that encourages the reader to continue. The introduction of the ghost and its interactions are well-integrated into the storyline.
* **[LOGIC/CONSISTENCY]**: The consistent portrayal of characters' beliefs and reactions to the supernatural enhances coherence. (Strength, No Issue)
