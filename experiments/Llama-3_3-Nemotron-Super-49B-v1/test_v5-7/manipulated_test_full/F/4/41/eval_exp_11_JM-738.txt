1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "teh", "unaccountable" repeated for emphasis without variation, "exspeditions")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thixotropy" not present but "holkow", "unlooked-for")
- [GRAMMAR] A few instances of missing or misplaced articles ("a new series of Readings" should be "a new set" or similar for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can confuse without prior knowledge of the mystery
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analytical sections and story summaries
- [CLARITY] Overly speculative sections may confuse readers unfamiliar with the original Dickens work
- [LOGIC] Assumptions in theories not always clearly grounded in provided text evidence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
