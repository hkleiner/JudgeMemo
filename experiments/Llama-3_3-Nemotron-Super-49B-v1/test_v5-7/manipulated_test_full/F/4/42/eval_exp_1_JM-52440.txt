1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., lengthy sentences with multiple clauses).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may reduce readability for modern readers.
- [REPEAT] Repetitive explanations of the same concept (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified) across different chapters.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text could benefit from clearer transitional phrases between chapters and subtopics for smoother flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of theological debates and Church of England documents might hinder understanding for some readers.
- [LOGIC] The argument relies heavily on the authority of Church documents without addressing potential counterarguments from the opposing viewpoint in depth.
