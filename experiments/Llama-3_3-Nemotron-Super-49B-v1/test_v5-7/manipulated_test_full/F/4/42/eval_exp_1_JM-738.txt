1. Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., the long, winding sentences in the "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY" chapter).
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder modern readers' flow.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistent verb tense shifts (noted in a few transitional paragraphs).

2. Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative and multiple unresolved plot threads may confuse readers.
- [CLARITY] Overly speculative sections (e.g., the extensive debate over Datchery's identity) might detract from the main mystery's clarity.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analytical commentary and storytelling (e.g., moving from character descriptions to theory discussions).

3. FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4. FINAL Fluency Score: 4
