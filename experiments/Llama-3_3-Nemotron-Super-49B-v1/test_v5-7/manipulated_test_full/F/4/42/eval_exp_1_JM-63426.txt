1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "enjoyed" instead of "enjoying" in some contexts, "wasnâ€™t" in place of "was not" for formal tone)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "make-up", "lay-out" without hyphen in some contexts, "telegraphed") might confuse modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies in narrative sections (switching between past and present)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can disorient readers unfamiliar with the subject's life events
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different life periods or topics without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical printing and design terms without explanation for non-specialist readers
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs lack a clear connection to the overarching narrative of Will Bradley's impact or personal growth

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
