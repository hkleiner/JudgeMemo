1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "colour" and "color" used interchangeably, though this could be a stylistic choice reflecting British vs. American English).
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may challenge modern readers (e.g., "gibber", "thou", "thee"), but this suits the narrative's Victorian setting.
- [SYNTAX] A few long, complex sentences may slightly impede immediate understanding, but they contribute to the period's literary style.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative seamlessly blends humor, horror, and romance, maintaining engagement.
- [LOGIC] The supernatural elements, while illogical in reality, are consistent within the story's fantastical framework.
- [CLARITY] Character motivations and the plot's progression are clear, despite the genre's inherent absurdities.
- [TRANSITION] Chapter transitions are smooth, with each building logically on the last.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
