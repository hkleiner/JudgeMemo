1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "verily", "thou", "thee") may challenge modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] A few apparent typographical errors or incomplete sentences (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is.").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy chapters and dense paragraphs might make navigation difficult for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between discussing different Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The extensive use of quoted material without immediate contextualization might momentarily confuse readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
