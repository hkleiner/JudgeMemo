1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter III's opening paragraph)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "gibber," "thou")
- [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors, but archaic spellings consistent with the narrative's style (e.g., "thou," "thee")
- [GRAMMAR] Mostly consistent, with minor deviations for character dialogue (e.g., Lord Canterville's responses)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) can slightly disrupt flow
- [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt without clear temporal or contextual bridges
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistencies in ghost's abilities and rules (e.g., vulnerability to certain actions)
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., the ghost's final transformation) could be more explicitly stated for some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.8**
