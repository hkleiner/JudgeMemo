- [GRAMMAR] Frequent use of archaic language and sentence structures (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "thee") which may confuse modern readers.

- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and lengthy sentences, hindering readability.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "a thing" used without clear reference).

- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague references ("a thing", "stuff") without clear explanation, confusing the reader.
