1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a thing", "stuff") and overly formal tone may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs and chapters without clear section breaks can overwhelm the reader.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] While overall logical, the text's lengthy introductions to each point may delay the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between discussing different Church documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.) could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of theological debates and specific Church documents might reduce clarity for non-experts.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
