1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "hyacinthine locks", "gipsy type") may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., long, nested sentences) disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors noted, but some archaic spellings and terms ("thou", "thee") may cause minor confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative assumes extensive prior knowledge of Dickens' works and the unfinished story's context, potentially confusing new readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear discussion of theories and lack of clear sectioning between analysis and theory presentation can disorient.
- [CLARITY] Overabundance of speculative theories and character analyses may overwhelm the central mystery's clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
