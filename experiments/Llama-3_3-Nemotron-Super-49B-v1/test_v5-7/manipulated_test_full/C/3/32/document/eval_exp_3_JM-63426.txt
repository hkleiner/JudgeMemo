- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but some archaic terms and names may confuse modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] A few instances of inconsistent verb tense, particularly in autobiographical sections

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can be disorienting at times
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different periods of the author's life
