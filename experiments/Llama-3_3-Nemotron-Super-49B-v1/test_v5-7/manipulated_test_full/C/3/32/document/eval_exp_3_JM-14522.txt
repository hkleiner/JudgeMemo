1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", less common in modern English) might require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.
- [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected, assuming the intentional archaic spellings (e.g., "thou") are acceptable.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between comedic relief and deep, philosophical themes, which might slightly disjoint the reading flow for some readers.
- [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden depth) and the resolution of Virginia's experience could be more explicitly developed for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.8**
