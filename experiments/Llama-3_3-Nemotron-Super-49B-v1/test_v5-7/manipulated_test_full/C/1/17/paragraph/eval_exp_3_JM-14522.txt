1. Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but implied need for modern readers to adjust) and overly elaborate descriptions might slow reading.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] **None Noted** (assuming the text's intentional archaic spellings and grammar are preserved for effect)

2. Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., sudden shifts from story to unrelated philosophical musings, e.g., "The adaptation of animals...") can disrupt flow.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters or scenes without clear connectors.
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations or actions (e.g., the ghost's final transformation, Virginia's decision process) could be more explicitly stated for clarity.

3. FINAL Coherence Score: **4.0**

4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
