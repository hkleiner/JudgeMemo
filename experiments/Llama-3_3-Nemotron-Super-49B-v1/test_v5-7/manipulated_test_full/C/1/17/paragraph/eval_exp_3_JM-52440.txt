1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", in quoted material) and theological jargon may require additional effort for non-specialist readers.
- [REPEAT] Repetitive phrasing in emphasizing the Church of England's stance for clarity, though effective, slightly impacts flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-relevant, abrupt text insertions (e.g., descriptions of artworks, unrelated narratives) disrupt the overall thematic coherence.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some chapters and the insertion of unrelated texts.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents may reduce clarity for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
