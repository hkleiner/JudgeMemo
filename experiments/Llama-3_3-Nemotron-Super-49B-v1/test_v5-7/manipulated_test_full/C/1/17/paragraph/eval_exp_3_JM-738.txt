1. Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", less common in modern English) might require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.
- [SYNTAX] Infrequent use of transitional phrases between some paragraphs could slightly disrupt the flow.

2. Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy, detailed analysis and multiple embedded theories might overwhelm readers not deeply invested in the mystery's solution.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and its characters could hinder understanding for those unfamiliar with the work.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analyzing the text and presenting theories (e.g., from Forster's evidence to Mr. Proctor's theory) without clear sectioning.

3. FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4. FINAL Fluency Score: 4
