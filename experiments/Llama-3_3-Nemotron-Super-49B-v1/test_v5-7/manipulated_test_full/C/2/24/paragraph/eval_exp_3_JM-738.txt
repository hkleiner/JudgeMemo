1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "hyacinthine locks", "Grecian nose") may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., long, nested sentences) disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors noted, but some archaic spellings and terms ("thou", "thee") may cause minor confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative assumes extensive prior knowledge of Dickens' works and characters, potentially alienating unfamiliar readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling and multiple unresolved plot threads (e.g., Datchery's true identity, the fate of Edwin Drood) may confuse readers.
- [CLARITY] Overreliance on theoretical discussions about the mystery's solution sometimes obscures the primary narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
