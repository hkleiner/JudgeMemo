1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] None notable (assuming "emerald-green" and similar compound adjectives are intentional for effect)
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity but are grammatically correct
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" in quoted prophecies, "gibber") might require reader effort but suits the narrative's period feel
- [SYNTAX] Mostly consistent; minor deviations enhance the period or comedic effect (e.g., Mr. Otis's dialogue)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency: The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., holding a dagger, being wet) despite being a spirit, but this is a narrative choice rather than a flaw
- [STRUCTURE] Chapters are well-defined, but the transition between the ghost's antics and the deeper, more emotional conclusion with Virginia could be smoother for some readers
- [CLARITY] Generally clear, though the ghost's backstory and motivations are gradually revealed, which might slightly delay full understanding
- [TRANSITION] The shift in tone from comedic to poignant (especially in Chapter V) is well-handled but might feel abrupt to some

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.8**
