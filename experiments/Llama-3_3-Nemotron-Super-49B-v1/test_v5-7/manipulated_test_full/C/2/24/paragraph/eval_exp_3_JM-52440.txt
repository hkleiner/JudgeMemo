1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") and theological jargon may require additional interpretation for non-specialists.
- [LENGTH] Extremely lengthy paragraphs and sentences can reduce readability.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy nature and detailed, argumentative style, while coherent, may challenge sustained reader engagement.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters and sometimes within lengthy paragraphs could be more explicitly marked for smoother flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents might obscure understanding for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
