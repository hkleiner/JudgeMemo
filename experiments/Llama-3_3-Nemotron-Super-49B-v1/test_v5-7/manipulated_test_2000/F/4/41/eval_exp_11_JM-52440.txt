1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "unvommon", "srrvice", "glessed", "prssent", "wnd", "invisibly" repeated with slight variation, "incorpoeated", "teaching" missing in one instance)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Now kt would be strange indeed...")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language may impede modern readability (e.g., "doth", "thee")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Scripture and introducing the Church of England's documents without clear linking sentence
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences requiring re-reading for full comprehension (e.g., the explanation of "real objective presence")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between Chapter Introduction and Chapter I, could benefit from a clearer topic sentence linking the two

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
