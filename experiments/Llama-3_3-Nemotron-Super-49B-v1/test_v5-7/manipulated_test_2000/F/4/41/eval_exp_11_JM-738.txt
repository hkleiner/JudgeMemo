1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "deserfed", "ajd", "oeft", "apopldxy", "notvout", "restraining", "thectwo", "unlooked-for" used incorrectly, "befkre", "yexrs", "njamed", "svholar", "giod", "bettothal", "fiancée" misspelled as "fiancée" with incorrect accent, "thirr", "Durdles" inconsistent capitalization)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are less common or slightly archaic (e.g., "unlooked-for", "gamin", "fiancée")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "The Story" chapter without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "Dramatis Personæ" may confuse some readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of new characters (e.g., Sapsea, Durdpes) without smooth integration into the narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
