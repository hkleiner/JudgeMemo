1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "fsw", "tuey", "reavhed", "Myerw", "librwry", "evwrything", "anmold", "obpong", "Yhe", "xven", "delicate withvthe", "n" instead of "and", etc.)
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "which he never ceased to regret" could be more smoothly integrated)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "punctilious", "guarfiants", "receptive expectations"), which might affect readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and Chapter II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] A few instances where the narrative jumps (e.g., the sudden appearance of the ghost without preceding suspense in Chapter II) could be smoother.
- [TRANSITION] Minor lack of transitional phrases between some paragraphs, slightly disrupting the flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
