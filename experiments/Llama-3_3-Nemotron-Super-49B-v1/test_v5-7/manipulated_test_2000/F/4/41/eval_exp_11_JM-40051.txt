1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "have been" and "was" in close proximity)
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "princopak", "cohsequently", "admirirg", "dimentions", "prlper", "inhabitant", "investigatikn", "beautifull", "scwttered", "jageed", "endkess")
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., the first paragraph of the second section)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "veritable", "thou", implied by "thee" in context, though "thee" not directly used)
- [REPEAT] Repetitive descriptions of the garden's beauty without adding new insights

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location without clear, logical connections to biblical text beyond superficial comparisons
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from describing the garden to discussing snakes without a smooth transition)
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages obscuring the main argument
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between ideas (e.g., moving from the garden's description to its historical settlement)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
