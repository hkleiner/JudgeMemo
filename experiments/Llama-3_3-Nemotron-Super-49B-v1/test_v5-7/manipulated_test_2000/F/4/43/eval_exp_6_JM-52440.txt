1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but overall formal tone) and theological jargon may challenge non-specialist readers.
- [REPEAT] Mild repetition in emphasizing the distinction between spiritual and material food without adding new insight each time.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing Scripture to focusing solely on the Church of England's documents could be more explicitly signaled.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph starting with "That the material food..." is densely packed with contrasting ideas, potentially confusing without careful reading.
- [TRANSITION] The shift in focus from doctrinal explanation to the Church's current state and the author's methodology, while relevant, feels somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.2
