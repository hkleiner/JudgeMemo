1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "picaresque", "gamin") might require additional effort for some readers.
- [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors observed.
- [GRAMMAR] Generally strong, with minor, non-distracting deviations in punctuation (e.g., missing articles in a few places for stylistic effect).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analysis, biography, and plot summary without clear transitional markers at times.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of Dickens' works and 19th-century context might leave some readers unclear on certain references.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from introducing characters to discussing the author's intentions without a smooth link.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
