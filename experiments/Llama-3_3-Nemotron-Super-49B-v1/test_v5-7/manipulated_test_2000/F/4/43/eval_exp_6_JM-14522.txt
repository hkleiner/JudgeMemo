1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure in Mr. Otis's response to Lord Canterville (e.g., "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can...").
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may challenge modern readers (e.g., "dressing for dinner", "receptive expectations", "gyves").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, incorrect comma usage in lists).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" without clear sectioning or title for the second part.

- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from daily activities to the ghost's appearance at night without transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.2
