1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "those who was loyal", "the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt")
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "it would be found to consisted", "we was taught")
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "bless" instead of "blessed" in some contexts, "was" instead of "were" in "was endeavoured")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion")
- [LEXICON] Archaic language use (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but overall tone is somewhat antiquated)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between biblical interpretation and Church of England doctrine without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences that obscure the main point (e.g., the long sentence explaining the difference between Rome and the Church of England's stance)
- [LOGIC] Assumes shared knowledge of specific Church documents and their hierarchy of importance without introduction
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between paragraphs, especially when moving from Scripture to Church teachings

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.8
