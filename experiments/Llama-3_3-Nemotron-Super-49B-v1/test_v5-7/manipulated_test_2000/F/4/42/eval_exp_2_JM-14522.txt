1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "they am", "it has am", "Mr. Otis have")
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies (e.g., "was removed" after "must was")
- [SPELLING] "woedn't" (should be "wouldn't"), "receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena" (complex sentence, but not an error per se, yet contributes to slight readability issues)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "receptive expectations", "sanguineous") might slightly impede readability for general audiences
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the old country was so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or complex, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the long sentence discussing topics of conversation)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the family's daily activities and the ghost's appearance

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
