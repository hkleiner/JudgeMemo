1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaping", "ravaged mask", "guilty spirit") might require additional processing time for less advanced readers.
- [GRAMMAR] No major grammatical errors detected; minor punctuation variations consistent with stylistic choice.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative of "The Canterville Ghost" and the unrelated philosophical reflection on Christmas (later resolved as potentially a misplaced excerpt).
- [CLARITY] The sudden, unannounced shift in narrative voice and subject matter (e.g., from Canterville to Christmas to Stransom) can confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional elements between distinctly different narrative segments.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
