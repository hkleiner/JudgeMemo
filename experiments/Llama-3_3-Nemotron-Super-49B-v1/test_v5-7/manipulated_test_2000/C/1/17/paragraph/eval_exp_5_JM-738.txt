1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "munger") might require additional effort for comprehension.
- [GRAMMAR] No major grammatical errors detected; minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., quotation mark handling) in a few places.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the introductory analysis to the "Dramatis Personae" and then to "The Story" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Dickens's works and characters (e.g., _Edwin Drood_) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in narrative voice and style between the analytical introduction and the descriptive storytelling sections.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
