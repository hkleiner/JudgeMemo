1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between sentences in different chapters (e.g., from discussing Bradley's impact to analyzing Dickensâ€™s last plot without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "non-archaic")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or extra commas in long sentences)
- [STRUCTURE] Unmarked shift from third-person narrative to first-person reminiscence in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in topic from Will Bradley's work to a detailed, unrelated narrative about a boy printer
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases or sentences between vastly different topics (Bradley's career vs. the boy printer's story)
- [CLARITY] The purpose or relevance of "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" to Will Bradley's chap book is not explicitly stated
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to conflate two distinct topics without a unified thematic or contextual link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
