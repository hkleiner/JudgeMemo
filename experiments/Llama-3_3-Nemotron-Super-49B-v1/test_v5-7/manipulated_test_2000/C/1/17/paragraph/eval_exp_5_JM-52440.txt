1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Utilization of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sifting time", "sacramental appointment") could hinder comprehension for non-specialist readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in some paragraphs (though rare).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the theological discussion and the narrative excerpts (e.g., from Church of England doctrine to "The storm raged fiercely...").
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge in theological debates may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between distinct narrative segments and the main theological argument.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
