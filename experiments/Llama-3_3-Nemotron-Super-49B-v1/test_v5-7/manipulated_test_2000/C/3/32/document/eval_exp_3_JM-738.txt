1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "a stuff", "gamin", "fain") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" appears to be a placeholder or error, disrupting fluency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analysis, backstory, and the story itself without clear transitional markers at times.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Dickens' works and historical context might leave some readers unclear on certain references.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from introducing characters to detailing the opening of the tale could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.2
