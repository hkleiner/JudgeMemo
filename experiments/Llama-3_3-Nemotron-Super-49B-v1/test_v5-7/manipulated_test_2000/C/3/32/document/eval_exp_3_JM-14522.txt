1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "whilst", implied by context though not directly present, and "gyves") might require additional cognitive effort for less experienced readers.
- [SPELLING] No issues detected.
- [GRAMMAR] Generally strong, with no critical errors noted.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness between the end of Chapter I and the beginning of Chapter II without a clear temporal or thematic bridge.
- [CLARITY] Minor reduction in clarity when transitioning between descriptive scenes and dialogue due to rapid shifts in narrative focus.
- [LOGIC] The character's reactions (e.g., Mr. Otis's response to the ghost) occasionally border on implausibility, potentially straining believability for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.8
