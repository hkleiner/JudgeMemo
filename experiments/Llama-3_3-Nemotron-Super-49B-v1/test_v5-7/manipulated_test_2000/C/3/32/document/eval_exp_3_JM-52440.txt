1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language (e.g., "stuff" likely meaning "Church" or similar, "thou/thee" not present but "whomsoever" is) and formal tone may challenge less familiar readers.
- [REPEAT] Mild repetition in emphasizing the distinction between material and spiritual food without adding new insight each time.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Doctrine of the Real Presence and the Church of England's documents, which might disorient uninformed readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between discussing Scripture, the Church of England's teachings, and the author's objectives could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The core question ("whether the precious body and blood... are in the bread and in the wine...") takes time to emerge clearly, buried under initial assertions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
