1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic language usage (e.g., "antldiluvians", "thoroughly satisfied") 
- [SPELLING] Typos and inconsistencies (e.g., "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "Bridtish" instead of "British") 
- [REPEAT] Repetitive use of "stuff" (unclear context, possibly a placeholder) 
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the thing" without clear explanation)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions without clear evidence (e.g., linking the described location directly to the Garden of Eden) 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumps between biblical interpretation, personal discovery, and geographical description) 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., from serpent discussion to Christian settlement impact) 
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages hindering main argument flow 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
