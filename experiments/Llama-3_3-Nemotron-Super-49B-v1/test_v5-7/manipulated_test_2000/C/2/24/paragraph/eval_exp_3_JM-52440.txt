1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whomsoever") and formal tone may reduce accessibility for modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] No major grammatical errors detected; text is largely error-free.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between philosophical/theological discussions and the introduction of unrelated technological phrases ("The voice recognition module powered up", "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb", "The biosensor updated its readout") disrupt coherence.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents may confuse uninformed readers.
- [LOGIC] The text's logical flow is generally strong within its theological arguments but is interrupted by the aforementioned unrelated phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
