1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic terms (e.g., "hologram", "bluetooth signal", "surveillance camera") disrupt the historical setting's consistency.
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter I to II could be smoother with a clearer temporal or thematic bridge.
- [LOGIC] The sudden, unexplained appearance of modern technology (hologram, bluetooth, surveillance camera) in a historical context jars the narrative's coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
