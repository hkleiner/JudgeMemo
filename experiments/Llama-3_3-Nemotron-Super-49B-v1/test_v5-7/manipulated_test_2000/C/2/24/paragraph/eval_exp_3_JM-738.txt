1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context or lookup for less experienced readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analytical discussion to "A cloud upload completed." and "The digital assistant logged the entry." without clear integration or explanation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from introducing the topic to specific character analyses without a smooth transition, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Dickens' works and historical context might leave some readers unclear on certain references.
- [TRANSITION] The inclusion of "An livestream began recording." at the end seems completely out of context and disrupts the coherence of the academic/textual analysis.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
