1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences may impede immediate clarity (e.g., the first paragraph of "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "pi", "picklelime", "Gordon press") might require explanation for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] No noticeable spelling errors.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clear connecting device.
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge (e.g., historical context of graphic arts, specific historical figures' impacts) might confuse uninformed readers.
- [TRANSITION] Within "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", some scene shifts (e.g., from school to moving, to working) feel slightly disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
