1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context or lookup for less experienced readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between historical context, literary analysis, and plot summary could be smoother in a few instances.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between introducing the topic, analyzing Dickens's style, and delving into the plot of "Edwin Drood" without a clear sectioning or transition that might help readers follow the author's intent more seamlessly.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Dickens's works and 19th-century literary context might leave some readers unclear on certain references.
- [LOGIC] The logical flow from discussing Dickens's health and writing style to diving into the plot analysis is somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
