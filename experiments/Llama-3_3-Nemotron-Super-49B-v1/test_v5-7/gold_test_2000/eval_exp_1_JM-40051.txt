1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs, hindering smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language usage (e.g., "antldiluvians", "veritable") may confuse modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Minor typo detected ("admirirg" instead of "admiring").
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional misuse of commas for sentence separation instead of periods.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between biblical interpretation, personal discovery, and geographical description.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts from describing the garden's beauty to discussing snakes and then to Christian influence without clear connectors.
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., landscape details) may overwhelm the central argument about Eden's location.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
