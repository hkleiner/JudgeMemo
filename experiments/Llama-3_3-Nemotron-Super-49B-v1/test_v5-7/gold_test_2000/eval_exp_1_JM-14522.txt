1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sanguineous", "gyves") might require additional effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter I to II could be smoother with a more explicit connection or transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt introduction of the ghost's appearance at 1 o'clock could benefit from slightly more contextual setup for maximum impact.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
