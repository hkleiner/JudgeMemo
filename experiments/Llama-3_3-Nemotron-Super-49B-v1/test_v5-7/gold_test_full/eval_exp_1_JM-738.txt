1. Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs, hindering smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may confuse modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional lack of consistency in verb tense, particularly in speculative sections about the plot's resolution.

2. Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Speculative theories about the plot's conclusion sometimes feel disconnected from the presented text.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analyzing the given story, presenting theories, and critiquing other interpretations, which can be disorienting.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume prior knowledge of Dickens' works or the context of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", potentially confusing unfamiliar readers.

3. FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
