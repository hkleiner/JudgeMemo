1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") and theological jargon may hinder comprehension for non-specialists.
- [LENGTH] Extremely lengthy paragraphs and sentences can make sustained reading challenging.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's coherence is high overall, but the transition between chapters and the integration of scriptural references could be more explicitly signposted for easier follow-along.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents might reduce clarity for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between discussing different Church documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.) are generally clear but could be slightly more seamless.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
