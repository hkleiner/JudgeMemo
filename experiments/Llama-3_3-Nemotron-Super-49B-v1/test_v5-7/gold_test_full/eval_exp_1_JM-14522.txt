1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., nested clauses).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") and overly formal language might challenge modern readers.
- [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) require close reader attention.
- [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt without clear temporal or thematic bridges.
- [CLARITY] A few instances of unclear character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden emotional depth).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.2**
