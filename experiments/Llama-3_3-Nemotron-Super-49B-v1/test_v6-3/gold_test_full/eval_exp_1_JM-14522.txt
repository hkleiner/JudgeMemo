- [GRAMMAR] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but other antiquated terms) might challenge modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in some chapters (e.g., ghost's backstory) might confuse without close attention
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden emotional depth) feel slightly abrupt
