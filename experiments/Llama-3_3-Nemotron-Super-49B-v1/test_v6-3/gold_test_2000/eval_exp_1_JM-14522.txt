Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", implied by overall tone, though not directly present in the given text, and "gyves") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the family's daily activities to the ghost's appearance without a clear transitional phrase, though this is somewhat intentional for dramatic effect.
- [CLARITY] The shift in tone from humorous skepticism to supernatural encounter, while effective, might slightly disorient some readers due to its swiftness.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
