Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "heaven's-hard", "gamin", "femme fatale" connotations without clear context)
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., long, winding narratives without clear paragraph breaks)
   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but some archaic spellings/terminology may confuse modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [LOGIC] Unresolved plot threads (e.g., the ultimate fate of Edwin Drood, the significance of the Princess Puffer's past)
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can be disorienting; abrupt transitions between theoretical discussions and story retelling
   - [CLARITY] Overreliance on reader familiarity with Dickens' original work and its context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
