Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some sections.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") and overly formal tone may reduce readability for modern readers.
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs and chapters without clear section breaks can overwhelm the reader.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theological discussion and unrelated narrative excerpts (e.g., descriptions of artworks, personal anecdotes) disrupt the logical flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly dense theological jargon and concepts without sufficient explanation for non-expert readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between chapters (e.g., from "The Real Presence" to "Adoration" without a bridging summary).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
