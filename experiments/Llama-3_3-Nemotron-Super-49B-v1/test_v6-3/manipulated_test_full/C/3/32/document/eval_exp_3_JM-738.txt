1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "hyacinthine locks", "gipsy type")
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures
   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but archaic spellings (e.g., "thou", "thee") may affect modern readability

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Some plot conjectures feel overly speculative without clear textual evidence
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear discussion of theories can confuse the narrative flow
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Datchery's identity, Princess Puffer's purpose) are not fully resolved or clearly explained
