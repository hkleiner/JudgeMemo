Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] None notable (modern text with intentional archaic spellings for style)
   - [GRAMMAR] None notable (consistent with Victorian-era narrative style)
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, long sentences (e.g., Chapter I, Mr. Otis's dialogue) but fitting for the style
   - [LEXICON] Rich, varied, and appropriate for the narrative voice (no issues)

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency: The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., moving objects, being wet) despite being a spirit
   - [STRUCTURE] Chapters somewhat loosely connected by ongoing narrative, but effective for serial storytelling
   - [CLARITY] Occasionally, character motivations or backstory could be clearer (e.g., the ghost's sudden emotional depth)
   - [TRANSITION] Smooth between chapters, maintaining narrative flow

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4.5**
