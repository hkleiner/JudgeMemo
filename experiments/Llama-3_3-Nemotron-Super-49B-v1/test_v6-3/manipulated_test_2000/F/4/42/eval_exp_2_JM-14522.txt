Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "they am", "it was removed at once")
- [SPELLING] Misspellings (e.g., "recovered" as "recover", "would" as "woedn't")
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "had seen" with "would make")
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic language use (e.g., "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover" in a historical context, though this could be intentional for comedic effect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions sometimes obscure the plot progression
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in scene (e.g., from dinner to the next morning without transitional phrases)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
