Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "It shoulded be talked about" (should be "should be")
- [GRAMMAR] "what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." (missing article for clarity)
- [GRAMMAR] "the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that wasn’t over yet." (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "realized" (should be "realize" for consistency in tense)
- [SYNTAX] "In its way it was as American as the Declaration of Independence." (sudden shift in topic flow)
- [GRAMMAR] "He may had had some idea in mind" (incorrect verb form, should be "may have had")
- [GRAMMAR] "it don’t worked" (should be "it didn't work")
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in several places)
- [LEXICON] "lusty, democratic ambition" (while not incorrect, feels somewhat archaic and less fluent in modern reading)
- [GRAMMAR] "You was" (repeated incorrect subject-verb agreement)
- [GRAMMAR] "when you was hungry" (incorrect verb form)
- [GRAMMAR] "You are now a worked man" (should be "a working man")
- [GRAMMAR] "You are sorry" (lacks a clear subject-verb connection in the sentence flow)
- [GRAMMAR] "You went out on the street and employ" (should be "employing" for verb consistency)
- [GRAMMAR] "You and your devil forage" (should be "foraged" for tense consistency)
- [GRAMMAR] "to got kindling" (should be "to get kindling")
- [GRAMMAR] "The owner and editor is John D. West" (subject-verb agreement error, should be "are")
- [GRAMMAR] "You are not that important to Mr. Newett" (feels abrupt, lacking transitional flow)
- [GRAMMAR] "at fifteen you are spoken of as foreman" (passive voice feels less engaging)
- [GRAMMAR] "in ’85 a man’s wages" (lacks clarity on what "’85" refers to without context)
- [GRAMMAR] "All editors warn them to keep away" (ambiguous pronoun reference)
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Newett has written his last sheets of copy" (unclear what "last" implies in this context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Bradley's impact to his personal biography without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The shift from third-person narrative to a first-person, child's perspective in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" is jarring without introduction.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of detailed, specific events from Bradley's childhood feels disconnected from the initial thematic discussion of his artistic impact.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between paragraphs, especially when moving from one time period or topic to another.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between describing Bradley's professional achievements and his personal life without a clear narrative thread connecting these aspects cohesively.
- [CLARITY] Assuming prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams") without providing brief explanations for potentially unfamiliar readers.
- [LOGIC] The narrative's focus shifts significantly, making it hard to discern the primary subject of the text at times (Bradley's art, his biography, or his impact).
- [STRUCTURE] The ending feels abrupt, with no concluding statement tying together the significance of Bradley's life and work.
