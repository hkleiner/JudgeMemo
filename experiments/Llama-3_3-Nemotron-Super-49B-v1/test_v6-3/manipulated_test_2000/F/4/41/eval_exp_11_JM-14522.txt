Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "vety", "guarfians", "waw", "xeven", "whxt", "Myerw", "librwry", "evwrything")
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or overly formal language may hinder smooth reading for some modern readers (e.g., "simce", "vety mysterious circumstances", "guilty spirit")
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Some character introductions (e.g., the twins) feel slightly rushed or tangential to the immediate plot
- [LOGIC] The sudden, unexplained appearance of the ghost in Chapter II could be more seamlessly integrated

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
