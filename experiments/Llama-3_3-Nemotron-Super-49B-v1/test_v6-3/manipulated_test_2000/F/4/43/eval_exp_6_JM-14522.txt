- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing and word choice in some dialogue (e.g., "I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody.")
- [SPELLING] None detected in the provided excerpt, but formatting issues (e.g., "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-", "CHAPTER: nothing") may indicate text processing errors.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing the family's discussion to the ghost's appearance without clear setup.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" without clear division or title for the next section.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, slightly hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of family members' traits and actions).
