Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture") might require additional effort for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "Nickleby _as_ Nickleby" (missing article or incorrect formatting).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "THE STORY" chapter without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed character introductions might overwhelm the reader before the story unfolds.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from analyzing Dickens's work to introducing the dramatis personae feels somewhat disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
