Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple places (e.g., "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul;...")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases for emphasis without variation (e.g., repeated "that the" constructions)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few instances (not critically impacting understanding)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Scripture to introducing the Church of England's documents without a clear linking sentence
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs requiring multiple readings for full comprehension
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are already familiar with the specific doctrines in question without brief contextualization

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
