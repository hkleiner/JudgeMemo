Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the long, descriptive passage about Christmas)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture", "saucy school-girl")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "We knew that we should be wakened" could be "will be wakened" for consistency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the introductory chapter to "The Story" without clear thematic linkage
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed character introductions might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context of "Edwin Drood"
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in narrative voice and style between the introductory analysis and the dramatis personae(section breaks could be more distinct)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
