Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", implied by "thee" in quoted Scripture context, though not directly present) and formal tone might challenge modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theological explanation and the author's investigative objective (e.g., the shift after "The autonomous vehicle...").
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents might confuse uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
