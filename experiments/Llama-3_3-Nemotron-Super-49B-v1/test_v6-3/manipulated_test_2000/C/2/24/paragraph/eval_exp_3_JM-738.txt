Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture") might require additional context for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and narrative summary (e.g., the shift from discussing Dickens's health to analyzing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about character intentions (e.g., Jasper's motivations) are sometimes presented without clear textual evidence from "Edwin Drood" itself.
- [TRANSITION] The narrative jumps abruptly from the introduction to the dramatis personae without a clear connecting statement.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed character backstories (e.g., the history of "The Princess Puffer") might overwhelm the central mystery for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
