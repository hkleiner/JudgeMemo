Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "a thing" (repeated placeholder for a noun, disrupting natural flow)
- [SYNTAX] "since my grandaunt... (long, complex sentence without clear punctuation for modern readers)
- [SPELLING] None noted, assuming "a thing" is intentional for critique
- [GRAMMAR] "which he never ceased to regret" (could be more fluidly integrated)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about characters' backstories (e.g., Washington's name origin)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from daily conversations to the ghost's appearance without build-up

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
