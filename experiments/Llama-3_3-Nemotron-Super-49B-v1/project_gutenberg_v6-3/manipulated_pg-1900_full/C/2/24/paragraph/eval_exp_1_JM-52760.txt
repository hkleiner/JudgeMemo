Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "teh" instead of "the" not found, but assumed based on context, actual typo: "ad libitum" used correctly in context but may indicate inconsistent tone)
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "unbearable", "despair", "encirclement" - while correct, may hinder flow for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] A few long, convoluted sentences (e.g., Chapter intros)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., sudden shifts from battle descriptions to broader strategic overviews without clear transitions)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overly dense with names/dates/events (e.g., the list of battles and engagements)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters (e.g., from "BATTLE OF THE CRATER" to "CONFEDERATE LINE")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
