Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter I's opening)
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dernier cri", "bonhomie") may hinder immediate understanding for all readers
   - [SPELLING] No notable issues detected

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between chapters without clear transitions)
   - [CLARITY] Some scenes or character motivations could be more explicitly stated for clarity (e.g., the curate's immediate deep feelings for Eileen)
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous, light-hearted moments and more serious, dramatic scenes
