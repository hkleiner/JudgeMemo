Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "You make joketh. Well, nevertheleth, you have no ship.")
   - [SPELLING] Intentional misspellings for character effect (e.g., "lisp" portrayals) but no actual errors
   - [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common terms (e.g., "tri-di star", "abrevitog") might confuse modern readers

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Vardin's character and backstory
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt ending with some unresolved plot threads (e.g., the fate of Earth and the galaxy)
   - [CLARITY] Complex sci-fi concepts (e.g., hyper-space mechanics, proto-man) could benefit from clearer explanation for casual readers

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
