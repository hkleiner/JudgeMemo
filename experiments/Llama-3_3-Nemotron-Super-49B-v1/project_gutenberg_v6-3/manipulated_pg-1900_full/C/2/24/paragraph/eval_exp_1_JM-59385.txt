Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It was then that she began to smoke a long-stemmed pipe. Just a few whiffs of opium quieted his nerves...") 
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutung", "Lanterns... shaped like bright colored autumn leaves") 
   - [SPELLING] No notable issues detected

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt time jumps (e.g., from wedding to years later without clear transition) 
   - [TRANSITION] Some sections feel disconnected from the main narrative flow (e.g., the sudden appearance of modern elements like "hologram", "hoverboard", "camera drone", "motion sensor", "auto-cleaning system", "robotic arm", "laser display", "holographic map", "speech recognition unit") 
   - [CLARITY] A few character motivations and plot points could be more explicitly stated for clarity

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: 3.5
