Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "lumubrations", "luminary") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures can impede smooth reading flow.
   - [GRAMMAR] A few instances of outdated grammatical constructions (e.g., "I had done a few things and earned a few penceâ€”I had perhaps even had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the patronising;").

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression and lack of clear chapter thematic separation might confuse some readers.
   - [CLARITY] The central mystery (Vereker's secret) remains unclear, potentially frustrating readers seeking resolution.
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be smoother, with more explicit connections between plot developments.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
