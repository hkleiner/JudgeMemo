Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "doth", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences in some chapters (e.g., Chapter II) might impede smooth reading.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Anthony's backstory and present) without clear transitional markers.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Aunt Hitty's funeral planning enthusiasm) feel overly elaborated, slightly distracting from the main narrative.
   - [LOGIC] The rapid depth of emotional connection between Lyddy and Anthony, while poignant, feels somewhat accelerated.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4.0**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
