  - [SYNTAX] Complex, sometimes convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter VI)
  - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "telegraphed", "carabao" without immediate context for modern readers)

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between descriptive, reflective, and event-driven sections
  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters without clear thematic or chronological flow indicators
  - [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages sometimes obscure the main narrative or point (e.g., detailed food descriptions in Chapter V)
