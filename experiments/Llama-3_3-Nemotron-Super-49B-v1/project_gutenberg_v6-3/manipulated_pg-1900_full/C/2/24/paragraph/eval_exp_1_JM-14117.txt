Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") and formal tone may reduce accessibility for all readers.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.
   - [SYNTAX] Generally well-structured, with effective use of transitions between paragraphs.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] The text is highly structured, but the lengthy chapters and lack of clear section summaries might make navigation challenging for some readers.
   - [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with early 20th-century societal norms and "the Servant Problem" could affect clarity for modern readers.
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters are logical, but the shift from problem description to solution (Part II) could be more explicitly signaled.
   - [LOGIC] The argument's logic is sound, but some supporting examples feel anecdotal rather than broadly representative.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
