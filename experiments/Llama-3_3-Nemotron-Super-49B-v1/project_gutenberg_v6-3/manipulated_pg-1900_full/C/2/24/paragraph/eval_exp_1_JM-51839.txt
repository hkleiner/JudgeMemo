Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "tejas" (should be "Tejas" for consistency, though contextually understandable)
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter: The Battle of Nacogdoches, first paragraph)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "booted heel" in poetic intro, though stylistically intentional)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative jumps (e.g., from 1819 to 1832 without clear transitional phrases)
- [CLARITY] Assumed historical knowledge (e.g., references to "the Revolution" without initial clear context)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt chapter endings/transitions (e.g., from "The Battle of Nacogdoches" to "Growth of American Influence")
