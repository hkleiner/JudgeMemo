Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "double-florins" (repeated, non-standard unit, could be clarified or standardized)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder readability for modern readers
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., first sentence of Chapter: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS) impair flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shifts from Boucher's life to broader historical events) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overwhelm with detailed, unreferenced historical context (e.g., descriptions of royal intrigues) potentially confusing the focus on Boucher
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters (e.g., from "THE STUDENT" to "VENUS AND MARRIAGE")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
