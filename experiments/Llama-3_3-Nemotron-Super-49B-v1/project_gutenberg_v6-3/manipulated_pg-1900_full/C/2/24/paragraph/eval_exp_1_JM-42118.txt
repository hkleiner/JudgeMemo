Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Occasional archaic spellings (e.g., "whilst", "thou") may cause minor reading adjustments for modern readers.
- [LEXICON] Some overly elaborate or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "luminary") might slightly impede flow for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Infrequent use of complex, lengthy sentences may momentarily disrupt smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure and abrupt historical context shifts (e.g., from Fragonard's life to broader French history) can confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt, lacking clear connections to the preceding narrative.
- [CLARITY] Occasional ambiguity in distinguishing between direct narrative and the author's reflective commentary.
