Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") might require additional processing for modern readers.
   - [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent use of modern punctuation conventions in quoted biblical texts.

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters and sometimes within lengthy paragraphs could be smoother.
   - [STRUCTURE] The text's broad thematic coherence is strong, but the depth of exploration in some tangential points slightly detracts from the central argument's flow.

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4.5**

4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.0**
