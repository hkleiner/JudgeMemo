Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whizzing", "thou", "thee") may hinder modern readers' understanding.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., multiple clauses) can disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (consistent with the text's style).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., from racing a comet to arriving in heaven).
- [CLARITY] Some sections rely heavily on assumed knowledge of the original literary context ("Captain Stormfieldâ€™s Visit to Heaven").
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., from heavenly bureaucracy to discussing wing functionality) without clear connections.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
