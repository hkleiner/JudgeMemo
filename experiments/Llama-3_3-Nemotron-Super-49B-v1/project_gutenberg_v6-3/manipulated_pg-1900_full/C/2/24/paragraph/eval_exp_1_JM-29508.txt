Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "co√∂peration", "thou") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between chapters could be more explicitly guided for smoother flow.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially overwhelming the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
