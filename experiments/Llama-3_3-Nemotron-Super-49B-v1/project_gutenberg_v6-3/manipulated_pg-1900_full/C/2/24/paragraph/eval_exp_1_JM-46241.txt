Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "medi√¶val", "thou") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of books and broader thematic discussions without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical printing and art terms (e.g., "Gothic spirit", "Renaissance rhetoric") could confuse some readers.
