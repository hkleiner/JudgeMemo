Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "thou", "thee", less common historical terms).
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [SPELLING] No errors noted, but names and historical terms vary in spelling (e.g., "Romsey"/"Rumsey").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative might confuse readers without a timeline or clear section transitions.
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge of historical context (e.g., monarchs, events) could reduce clarity for uninformed readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural descriptions, historical events, and biographical sketches.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
