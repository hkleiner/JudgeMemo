Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., long, nested sentences).
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] No major errors detected, but some archaic language usage (e.g., "whilst", "thou").

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [LOGIC] Transitions between philosophical concepts could be smoother.
   - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between critique, explanation, and personal reflection without clear sectioning.
   - [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge in philosophy (e.g., Spencer's works, Bergson) may confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
