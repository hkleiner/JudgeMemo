Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] "Pyreneean" (should be "Pyrenean" for consistency, though both are acceptable)
   - [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "peregrinations", "sous-lieutenant")
   - [SYNTAX] A few long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow in some sections (e.g., abrupt shifts between past and present)
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (especially Adolphe's) could be more explicitly developed for clearer understanding
   - [TRANSITION] Some scene transitions feel abrupt (e.g., from the grotto to the salon without clear temporal cues)

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
