Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the opening of the "Inductive Past" section) may impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion to specific examples (e.g., from moral dilemmas to the South African war) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Overly broad topics (e.g., the entirety of human destiny) sometimes lack focused, concrete support.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
