Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder modern readers' flow.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences in some chapters (e.g., Chapter V) can disrupt readability.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] No major errors detected, but some minor punctuation inconsistencies.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative (e.g., Chapter V's letter format) can momentarily confuse without clear transitional cues.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from realistic to supernatural elements (Chapter VI) may jar some readers.
   - [CLARITY] Diotti's internal conflict and motivations, while mostly clear, have moments of ambiguity (e.g., his decision to play the fifth string).

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4.0**
