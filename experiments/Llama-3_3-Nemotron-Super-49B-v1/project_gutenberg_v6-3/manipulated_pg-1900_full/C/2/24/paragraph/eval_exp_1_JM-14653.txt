Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") and overly formal tone might alienate modern readers.
   - [LENGTH] Excessively long chapters and paragraphs, potentially leading to reader fatigue.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression of ideas within and across chapters can confuse the narrative flow.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between philosophical reflection, personal anecdote, and societal commentary without clear connectors.
   - [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts and lack of concise summaries may obscure the central argument for some readers.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
