   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional archaic language usage (e.g., "thou", "thee") may cause minor readability issues for modern readers.
   - [SPELLING] No significant spelling errors detected.
   - [SYNTAX] Some long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
   - [LEXICON] Vocabulary is mostly clear, but some outdated terms (e.g., "fustian") might require clarification for all readers.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between past and present) without clear transitions in some chapters.
   - [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., Morley's actions) could be more explicitly explained.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt scene changes between chapters (e.g., from Chapter IV to V) without smooth bridging.
