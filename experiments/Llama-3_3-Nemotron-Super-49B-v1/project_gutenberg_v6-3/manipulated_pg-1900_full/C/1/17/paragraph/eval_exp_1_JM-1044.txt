Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., multiple clauses) can disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (consistent with the text's style).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., heavenly bureaucracy to racing comets).
- [CLARITY] Some sections rely heavily on assumed knowledge of heavenly/historical contexts without clear explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., from personal narrative to discussing historical figures' rankings in heaven) without smooth connections.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
