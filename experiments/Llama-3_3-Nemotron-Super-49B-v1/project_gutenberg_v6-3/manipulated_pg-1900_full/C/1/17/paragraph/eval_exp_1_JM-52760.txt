Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in some chapters (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative reason)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similar military terminology without sufficient contextual explanation for non-specialist readers
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, convoluted sentences impairing immediate clarity (e.g., in descriptions of battle strategies)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context and specific battle descriptions (e.g., the sudden shift from Petersburg's importance to the description of the "Dimmock Line")
- [CLARITY] Insufficient contextualization for events outside the immediate Petersburg campaign (e.g., references to Sherman's actions without brief summaries for coherence)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear chronological markers between chapters, potentially disorienting readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
