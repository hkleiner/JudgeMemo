2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE and the preceding text about Reynolds.
  - [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences, making the flow slightly disjointed.
  - [TRANSITION] The inclusion of unrelated historical/text snippets (e.g., Qur'Ã¡n, Mescalero Apache Reservation, Federal forces) disrupts coherence.
