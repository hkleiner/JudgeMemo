1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") and less common French terms might require additional effort for modern readers.
   - [PACING] Long, uninterrupted narrative passages can make the text feel dense.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., historical and philosophical inserts) disrupt the main storyline's flow.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive scenes and dialogue lack smooth transitions.
   - [LOGIC] The sudden, unforeshadowed historical and philosophical tangents confuse the narrative's focus.
