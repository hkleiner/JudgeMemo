Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "tejas" vs. "Texas" in different contexts, though this might be intentional for historical accuracy)
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures that slightly impede flow
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "gallant service") that may require reader effort

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative can be disorienting without a clear timeline
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different historical events or figures without smooth connectors
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overload on names and events, potentially confusing readers
