Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was born" and "is said" in the same paragraph)

- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for some audiences (e.g., "luminaries," "notwithstanding")
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., in the "Later Days of Famous Pioneers" chapter) impair flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from "How the Pioneers Lived and Fought" to "George Rogers Clark and the Revolution")
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences or conclusions (e.g., the paragraph starting with "But while men slept...")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between ideas within chapters
- [LOGIC] Unrelated quotes/inclusions (e.g., the Bahá’u’lláh quote at the end) disrupt narrative coherence
