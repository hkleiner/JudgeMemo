Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "threepence", "fustian") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between vastly different topics (e.g., from bookmen to sci-fi elements).
- [CLARITY] Certain paragraphs lack clear connections to the overarching theme, potentially confusing the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
