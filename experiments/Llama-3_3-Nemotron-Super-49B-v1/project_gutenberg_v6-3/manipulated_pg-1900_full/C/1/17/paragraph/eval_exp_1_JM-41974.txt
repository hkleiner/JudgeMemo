Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") may hinder modern readability.
- [SYNTAX] Infrequent, yet noticeable, long sentence structures (e.g., Chapter: THE WEDDING AT CANA's opening) that slightly impede flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter: THE DECORATION OF THE DUCAL PALACE and the unrelated paragraph about Carlsbad Caverns.
- [CLARITY] Some biographical jumps (e.g., Veronese's family life details) feel somewhat disconnected from the artistic narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
