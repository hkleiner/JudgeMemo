Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter III's opening paragraph)
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "palsied", "unziemlich")
   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but some names and terms (e.g., "Nannie", "Marjie") might benefit from consistency checks

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between deeply personal moments and broader, more philosophical reflections (e.g., the shift to discussing Bahá’u’lláh)
   - [CLARITY] A few sections are overly verbose or meandering, slightly obscuring the narrative's flow (e.g., Marjorie's flashback in Chapter IV)
   - [TRANSITION] The inclusion of unrelated historical/textual excerpts (e.g., about Reynolds, the Industrial Revolution) disrupts narrative coherence

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: 3.5

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: 4
