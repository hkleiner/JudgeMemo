Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "unintelligible", "frightful sort of dream")
  - [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences impair readability (e.g., the paragraph starting with "He watches Durdles...")
  - [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings may confuse modern readers (e.g., "thou", "thee")

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative and abrupt transitions between historical/critical commentary and the story (e.g., the sudden shift to discussing Ruskin and the Industrial Revolution)
  - [CLARITY] Overly speculative sections (e.g., theories on Datchery's identity) may confuse the main plotline
  - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some chapters/sections (e.g., "A QUESTION OF TASTE" seems disconnected)
