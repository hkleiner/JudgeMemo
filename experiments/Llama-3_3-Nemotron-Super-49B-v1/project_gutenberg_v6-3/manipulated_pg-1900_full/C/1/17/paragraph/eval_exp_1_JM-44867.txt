Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph starting with "But for all that...") may impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between philosophical discussion, historical examples, and futuristic speculation without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs (e.g., the one starting with "It is interesting...") assume prior knowledge of specific historical figures/events without brief context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
