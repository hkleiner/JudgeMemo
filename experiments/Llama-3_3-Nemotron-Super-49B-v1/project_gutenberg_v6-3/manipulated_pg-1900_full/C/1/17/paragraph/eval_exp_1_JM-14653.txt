Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "insoluble and fearful mysteries", "exhaustless source") may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., Chapter 7's opening paragraph) disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] No major errors detected, but some archaic language ("whilst", "thou") may cause minor pauses.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., sudden shift from philosophical discussion to descriptive scenes like the dungeon or the temple) can confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between some chapters (e.g., from Chapter 5 to 6) may leave the reader disconnected.
- [CLARITY] Some philosophical concepts (e.g., the nature of Evil in Chapter 10) are deeply explored but might not fully align with the central theme for all readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
