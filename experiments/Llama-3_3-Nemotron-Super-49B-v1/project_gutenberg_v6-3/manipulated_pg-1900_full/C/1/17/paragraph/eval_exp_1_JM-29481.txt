Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some passages (e.g., Chapter V's letter) can disrupt flow.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] No major errors noted, but some minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., quotation mark usage).

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative (e.g., Chapter V's letter interrupting the main storyline) might confuse some readers.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between philosophical discussions (e.g., Chapter III to IV) and the main plot can feel disjointed.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Mr. Wallace's intense disapproval) feel underdeveloped or suddenly introduced.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
