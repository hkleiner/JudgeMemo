Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" in quoted text, though contextually appropriate) might reduce readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter II and the unrelated, seemingly copied text snippet about a ghost (e.g., "I've been grounded...").
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of shared historical context (e.g., specifics of the war, historical figures without introduction) might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
