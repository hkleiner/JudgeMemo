   - [SPELLING] None noted
   - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., Chapter VIII's shift from past to present)

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can disorient readers (e.g., abrupt shifts between chapters)
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations and relationships are unclear (e.g., Gwendolen's true feelings towards Corvick)
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters and storylines can be abrupt (e.g., Chapter III to IV)
   - [LOGIC] The central mystery's significance and Corvick's obsession are not fully justified to all readers
