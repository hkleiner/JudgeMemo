Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences in several parts, disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between descriptive ethnographic sections and unrelated literary/artistic references (e.g., discussions of Reynolds, Boucher)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chapter or section themes beyond geographical locations, leading to disjointed narrative
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, detailed descriptions in some areas without clear relevance to the broader narrative or ethnographic purpose
- [TRANSITION] Poor linking between the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs chapters, and unrelated historical/literary inserts
