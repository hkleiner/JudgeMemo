Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder modern readability.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses) disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (consistent with the period) may cause minor confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., sudden shift from Anna Seward's life to Carlsbad Caverns) without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear, focused topic, making the overall narrative somewhat disjointed.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt changes in subject matter (e.g., from literary critique to historical events) without smoothing transitions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
