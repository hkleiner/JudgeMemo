- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures common in 18th-century writing can disrupt flow.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "Vigilant Man of War", "Pontoons") requires additional cognitive effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between historical, biographical, and reflective sections.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., shift from Hannah Snell's story to Mescalero Apache Reservation).
