Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., Chapter III, "had never fallen to the lot of the writer to cook" followed by "he refused to learn at that late day")
  - [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (e.g., "whip-cords") may affect readability for modern readers
  - [LEXICON] Overly formal and sometimes archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "verily" not present but "stir around", "vehiclo") may hinder smooth reading for some
  - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter I, describing the event of July 23, 1901) can disrupt flow

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from Chapter II to III, with no clear connection)
  - [LOGIC] Unrelated historical references (e.g., Napoleon in Chapter II) that donâ€™t clearly support the narrative
  - [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence or conclusion (e.g., Chapter VI, discussing life in the Philippines)
  - [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between ideas within and across chapters
