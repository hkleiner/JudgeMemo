1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thereby", "thou")
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of non-standard spellings (e.g., "colour" is not an issue, but "Cataract" for "cataract" in some contexts might be, though here it's capitalized as a proper noun)
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional misuse of commas for sentence separation

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt topic shifts (e.g., sudden switches from Niagara history to unrelated historical events)
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, verbose paragraphs hindering easy understanding
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters and ideas
- [LOGIC] Unnecessary inclusions (e.g., the section on foreign politics, Boucher's art) disrupting focus
