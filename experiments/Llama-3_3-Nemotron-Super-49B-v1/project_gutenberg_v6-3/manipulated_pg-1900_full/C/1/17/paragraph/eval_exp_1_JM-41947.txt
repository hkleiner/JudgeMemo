Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "colour" and "color" not consistently used, though this might be intentional for period style)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences with complex structures could benefit from simplification for smoother flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shifts from Boucher's biography to broader historical or philosophical contexts)
- [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt without clear thematic or chronological bridging
- [CLARITY] Infrequent but noticeable ambiguities in sentence meaning due to lengthy, packed sentences

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
