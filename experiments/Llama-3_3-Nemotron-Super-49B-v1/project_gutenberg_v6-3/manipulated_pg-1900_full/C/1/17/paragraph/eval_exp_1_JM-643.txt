Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "unregenerate", "profligate ease", "altruism")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter I's opening paragraphs)
- [SPELLING] None noted
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., Chapter IX's letter format)

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from Chapter III to IV, and VI to VII) with unrelated topics (historical, philosophical, and narrative sections)
- [LOGIC] Some character actions and motivations feel unexplained or abrupt (e.g., Mr. Morrow's sudden interest, Mrs. Wimbush's character shifts)
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions occasionally obscure the narrative's progression
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some chapters (e.g., the shift from Neil Paraday's story to historical and descriptive passages)
