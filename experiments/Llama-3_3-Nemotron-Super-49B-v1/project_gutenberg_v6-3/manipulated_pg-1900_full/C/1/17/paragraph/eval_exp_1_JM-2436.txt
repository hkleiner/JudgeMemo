  - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors
  - [GRAMMAR] Mostly correct, with minor instances of awkward phrasing

  - [CLARITY] Character motivations and backstories not always clearly established (e.g., Godfrey's situation, Mrs. Churchley's true feelings)
  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt changes in scene without clear connections (e.g., Chapter III's opening)
