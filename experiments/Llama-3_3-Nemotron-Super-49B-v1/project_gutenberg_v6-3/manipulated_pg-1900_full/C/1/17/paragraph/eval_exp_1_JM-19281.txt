Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some sections.
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") might reduce accessibility for some readers.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical, philosophical, and religious discussions without clear transitional phrases.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [LOGIC] Assumptions about the universal appeal and inevitability of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings are not fully supported by evidence within the text.
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and thematic jumps (e.g., sudden historical references without introduction) disrupt the narrative flow.
   - [CLARITY] Overly broad and vague statements (e.g., "the world's peoples... can learn to live and work... as a single race") lack specific examples or explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
