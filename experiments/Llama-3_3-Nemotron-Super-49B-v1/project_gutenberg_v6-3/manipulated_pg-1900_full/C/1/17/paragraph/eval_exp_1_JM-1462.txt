Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures in multiple chapters (e.g., "CHAPTER: ON SOME CARP AT SANS SOUCI")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readers' understanding (e.g., "penniless pensionnaire", "coxcomb")
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "CHAPTER" titles)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between topics (e.g., from Goody Twoshoes to Sans Souci carps to Christmas reflections)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical references, personal anecdotes, and descriptive passages
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overly dense with unrelated historical and cultural allusions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
