Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative need)
   - [LEXICON] Overuse of repetitive phrases for transitional purposes (e.g., "said Don," "said Sandy" without variation)
   - [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (e.g., "tewky") might confuse modern readers without context
   - [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences in descriptive passages (e.g., Chapter: A WALK IN EDINBURGH) that hinder immediate clarity

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters with little narrative flow connection (e.g., from "SCHOOL-DAYS AND HOLIDAYS" to "A WALK IN EDINBURGH")
   - [LOGIC] Unresolved subplot introductions (e.g., the significance of Sandy's parcel is resolved but feels like a minor, isolated event)
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions of settings and customs sometimes overshadow character development and plot progression
   - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal markers between some chapters, making the timeline somewhat ambiguous

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
