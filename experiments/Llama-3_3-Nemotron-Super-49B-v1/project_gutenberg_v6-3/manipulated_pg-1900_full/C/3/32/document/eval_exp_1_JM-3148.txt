Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a thing", "vest") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Some lengthy, complex sentences require re-reading for full comprehension.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Anthony's past and present) without clear transitional cues.
   - [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., Aunt Hitty's deep funeral planning enthusiasm) feel somewhat exaggerated or unclear in their depth.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between poetic descriptions and mundane dialogue.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
