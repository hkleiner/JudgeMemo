Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SPELLING] Multiple instances of "a thing", "the thing" (e.g., "the thing river", "a thing campaign") suggesting missing or redacted proper nouns.
  - [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing", "the thing") disrupting specificity.
  - [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have often wished I knew what became of that coon, for he was a dandy.").

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., insertion of "A thing report on the march..." without clear integration).
  - [CLARITY] Overly detailed accounts in some areas, underdeveloped in others (e.g., abrupt end of the war section).
  - [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between distinct battle/events narratives.
