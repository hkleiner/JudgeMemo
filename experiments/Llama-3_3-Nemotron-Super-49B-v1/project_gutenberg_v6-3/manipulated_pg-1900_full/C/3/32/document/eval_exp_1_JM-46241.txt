Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple places (e.g., "This opportunity they took with vigour and success, and by means of it put forth works which showed the best and most essential qualities of their race.")
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "mediæval", "thou", "thee")
   - [SPELLING] Consistent use of non-standard spellings (e.g., "mediæval" instead of "medieval") for emphasis on historical accuracy, but potentially distracting.

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression in some sections, jumping between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing German printers to French and Italian schools without clear transition)
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions may obscure main points for casual readers (e.g., extensive analysis of specific book illustrations)
   - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between chapters and some paragraphs.

3. FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
