Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "co√∂peration", "thou") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's broad scope and multiple chapters might make the overall argument's progression less immediately clear to some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between discussing historical context, philosophical underpinnings, and modern applications could be more explicitly stated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
