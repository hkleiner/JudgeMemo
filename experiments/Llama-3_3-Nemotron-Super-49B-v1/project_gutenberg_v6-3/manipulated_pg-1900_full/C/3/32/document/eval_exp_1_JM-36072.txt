1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "stuff", "a thing") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the 3rd paragraph) can disrupt flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Victorian Age description to Tennyson's biography) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., "the thing" referring to unspecified entities) without introduction.
