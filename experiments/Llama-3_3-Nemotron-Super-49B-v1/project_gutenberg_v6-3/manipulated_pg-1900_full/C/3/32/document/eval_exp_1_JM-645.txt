Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a few pence", "lucubrations", "a laugher") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures (e.g., Chapter I's opening paragraph) can disrupt flow.
   - [GRAMMAR] No major grammatical errors detected, but some sentences border on being overly convoluted.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative and lack of clear chapter thematic focus might confuse some readers.
   - [CLARITY] The central mystery (Vereker's secret) is intriguing but sometimes feels overly prolonged or obscure.
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be smoother, with more explicit connections to the overarching narrative question.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
