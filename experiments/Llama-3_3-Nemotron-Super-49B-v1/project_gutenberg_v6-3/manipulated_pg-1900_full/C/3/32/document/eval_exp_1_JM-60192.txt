   - [SYNTAX] Complex, sometimes convoluted sentence structures
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles and inconsistent verb tenses

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chapter introductions/transitions beyond topic titles
   - [CLARITY] Overly dense, technical information without summaries or simplifications
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical, descriptive, and practical information within chapters
   - [LOGIC] Some sections feel like disconnected lists (e.g., varieties of spices) without clear prioritization
