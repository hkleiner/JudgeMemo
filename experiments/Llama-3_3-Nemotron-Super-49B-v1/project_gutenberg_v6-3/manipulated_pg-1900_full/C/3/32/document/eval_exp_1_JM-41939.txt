Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, unclear what it refers to, possibly a placeholder or error)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal and less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "veritable", "thou", "whilst") may slightly impede readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, complex sentences may hinder immediate understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., the abrupt transition to discussing the art school in 1849 within the later career context) can disrupt flow.
- [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt without clear thematic or chronological bridging.
- [CLARITY] Infrequent but present ambiguities (e.g., "the thing" without clear reference) confuse the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
