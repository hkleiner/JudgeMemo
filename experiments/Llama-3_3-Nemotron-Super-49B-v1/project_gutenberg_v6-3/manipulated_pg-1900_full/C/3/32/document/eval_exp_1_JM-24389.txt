Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary (e.g., "dusker and vaguer", "stooling") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter IV's opening paragraph) can disrupt flow.
   - [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some archaic or less common spellings (e.g., "aÃ«rial") might cause brief pauses.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from description to dialogue without clear transition) in some chapters.
   - [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., Herold's initial feigned illness) could be more clearly introduced.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from romantic development to the revelation of Herold's past without smoother lead-in.
