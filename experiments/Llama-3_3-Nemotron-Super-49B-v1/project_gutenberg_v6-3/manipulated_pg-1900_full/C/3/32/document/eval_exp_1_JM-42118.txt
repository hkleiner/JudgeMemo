Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple instances of "a thing" (e.g., "a thing d'Este", "a thing of the stuff") suggest missing or incorrectly placed nouns, disrupting smooth reading.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It was safer so.") may cause minor pauses.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading tastes (e.g., "whilst", "thou"), though this is somewhat intentional for the subject matter.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Fragonard's life, broader historical events, and artistic analyses without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing readers.
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions and lack of clear paragraph focus in some sections (e.g., the detailed account of the Pompadour's influence) might obscure the main narrative thread.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts from biography to historical context (e.g., the Revolution's impact) without smooth linking.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
