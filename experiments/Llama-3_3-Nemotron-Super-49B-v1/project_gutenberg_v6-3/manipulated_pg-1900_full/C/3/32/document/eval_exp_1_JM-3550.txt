1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder readability for modern readers.
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses) can disrupt flow.
  - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., backstory insertions) without clear transitions.
  - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Adolphe's sudden change of heart) feel underdeveloped or abrupt.
  - [LOGIC] The rapid progression from engagement to marriage, and the subsequent event, feels somewhat rushed and convenient.
