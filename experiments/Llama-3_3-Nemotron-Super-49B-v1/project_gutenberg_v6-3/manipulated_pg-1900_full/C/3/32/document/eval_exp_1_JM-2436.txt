Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
   - [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a thing", "repaire", "fice to fice") might require adjustment for modern readers.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] The narrative's reliance on the protagonist's unexplained intuition about her father's engagement might feel abrupt to some readers.
   - [STRUCTURE] The transition between chapters and the introduction of new plot elements (e.g., Mrs. Godfrey) could be smoother for enhanced flow.
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (particularly Godfrey's actions and Mrs. Churchley's final decision) are sometimes unclear or under-explained.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
