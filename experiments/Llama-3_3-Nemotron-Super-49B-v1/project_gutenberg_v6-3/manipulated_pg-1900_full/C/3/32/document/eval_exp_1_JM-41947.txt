Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing", "stuff") for specific nouns, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., first paragraph of "THE SMALL BEGINNINGS").
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but archaic spellings may affect readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shifts from Boucher's life to broader historical context without clear transitions).
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions sometimes obscure the main subject (Boucher's life and art).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, making the narrative feel disjointed at times.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
