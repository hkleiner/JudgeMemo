Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague placeholder terms ("a thing", "stuff") instead of specific names or terms, causing confusion and disrupting flow.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Not caring for the growing crops and with no relish for the monotonous labor, the stuff easily persuaded a company of men...") that hinder smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between historical events without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing readers.
- [CLARITY] Overly broad statements (e.g., "the fertility of the soil and the wealth of timber and mineral led men to look to the commercial value of real estate") lacking specific examples or details to enhance understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
