Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple instances of "[a thing]" suggest missing or redacted text, disrupting fluency.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter V's long, descriptive passages).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden emotional depth) feel underdeveloped or abrupt.
- [LOGIC] Supernatural elements' rules are not consistently explained (e.g., the ghost's abilities and limitations).
