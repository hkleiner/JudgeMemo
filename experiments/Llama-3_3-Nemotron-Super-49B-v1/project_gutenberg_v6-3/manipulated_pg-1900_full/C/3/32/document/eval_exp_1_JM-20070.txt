Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
   - [SPELLING] None notable
   - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., Chapter V, "had gone" with "will penetrate")
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
   - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in emotional peaks (e.g., Chapter IV, Marjorie's realization) may cause brief pauses

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in Chapter III slightly disrupts chronological flow
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Nannie's depth of feeling) could be more explicitly stated
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Chapter IV to V without clear time transition marker
   - [LOGIC] The hunchback's final dialogue feels somewhat ungrounded without prior context

3. **FINAL Coherence Score:** 4.5

4. **FINAL Fluency Score:** 4.5
