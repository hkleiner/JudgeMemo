Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or overly formal vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "thou", "verily", "whosoever").
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some passages (especially in quoted writings) can impede smooth reading.
   - [SPELLING] No issues detected (assuming "stuff" and similar repetitions are intentional placeholders).

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] The text's highly segmented structure (many short chapters) might disrupt the flow for readers expecting a more linear narrative.
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be more explicitly guided for the reader to fully appreciate the chronological and thematic connections.
   - [CLARITY] Some sections assume prior knowledge of Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb, and their historical context, which might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
