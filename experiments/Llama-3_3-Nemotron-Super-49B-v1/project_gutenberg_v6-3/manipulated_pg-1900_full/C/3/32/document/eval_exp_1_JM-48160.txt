1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I had been told at Châlons that it was the “least bad”")
   - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "euphenism" instead of "euphemism", corrected in Transcriber’s note)
   - [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sauf conduit", "carnet rouge") may hinder readability for non-experts
   - [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences can impede flow (e.g., the first paragraph of "CHAPTER: INVADING THE WAR ZONE")

   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between locations and topics without clear transitions
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions sometimes obscure the main point of a section
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between personal anecdotes, descriptive passages, and informational sections
