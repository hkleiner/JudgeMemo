Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whizzing", "laid over the lot of them") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., multiple clauses) can disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] No issues detected.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between racing a comet and arriving in heaven) without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sections overly reliant on assumed cultural/historical knowledge (e.g., references to specific historical figures without context).
