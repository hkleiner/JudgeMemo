Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst", "coram populo") might require additional context for all readers.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected, but some character names and places (e.g., "the thing") are ambiguously presented, possibly intentional.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between chapters without clear temporal markers) can disorient readers.
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations and relationships (especially with "the thing" and its significance) could be more explicitly developed for immediate understanding.
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters or scenes feel abrupt, lacking smooth connectivity.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
