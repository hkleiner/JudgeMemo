Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the opening of the "Inductive Past" section) may impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing morality to introducing the concept of an "inductive future" without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., the distinction between inductive past and future) could benefit from additional concrete examples for enhanced clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
