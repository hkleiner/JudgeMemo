Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative reason)
   - [SPELLING] Occasional archaic or non-standard spellings (e.g., "stuff" used ambiguously, possibly as a placeholder or error)
   - [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms (e.g., "a stuff") which disrupts clarity
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, sometimes confusing sentence structures (e.g., long, convoluted sentences in Chapter VIII)

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from Chapter IV to V without clear temporal or spatial connection)
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can be disorienting for the reader
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations and relationships (especially between Debby and Morley) could be more clearly defined
   - [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between scenes, particularly in the later chapters

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
