Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing", "the stuff") without clear reference, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences impairing readability (e.g., multiple clauses without clear punctuation).
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but potential for typographical errors in names/places (e.g., "Solomonov" vs. common "Solomon").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning in emphasizing Russia's role without balanced analysis of other Allies' contributions.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological jumps and lack of clear section transitions (e.g., abrupt shift from historical events to future geopolitical speculation).
- [CLARITY] Overreliance on unsubstantiated claims (e.g., "Russia's role... was so important... without a thing, Germany would now dominate...").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
