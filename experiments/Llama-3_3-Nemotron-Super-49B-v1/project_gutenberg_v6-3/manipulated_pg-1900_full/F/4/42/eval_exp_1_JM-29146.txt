Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in several places (e.g., "have" instead of "had" in past tense contexts).
   - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "thith" instead of "this", "thertainly" instead of "certainly") likely due to character accents.
   - [LEXICON] Overuse of simplistic descriptors (e.g., "very", "really") in some areas.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained appearance of Vardin's true nature and powers.
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from space adventure to mystical elements without clear buildup.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Margot's sudden love declaration) feel rushed or unearned.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
