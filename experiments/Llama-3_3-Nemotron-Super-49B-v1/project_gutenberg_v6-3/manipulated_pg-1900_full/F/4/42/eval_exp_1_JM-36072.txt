   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected, but some proper nouns and historical references assume prior knowledge.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Transitions between historical, literary, and philosophical discussions can feel abrupt.
   - [CLARITY] Assumptions of reader familiarity with Victorian-era figures and events may reduce clarity for some.
