Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whizzing", "laid over", "caedn't") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures in some passages (e.g., the barkeeper's reception description) can disrupt flow.
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of archaic spellings (e.g., "caedn't" for "couldn't") for stylistic effect, not errors.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from racing a comet to arriving in heaven) without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some humorous, satirical points (e.g., heaven's bureaucracy) might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the original work's context.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from descriptive passages to dialogue-heavy sections (e.g., Sandy McWilliams' explanations).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
