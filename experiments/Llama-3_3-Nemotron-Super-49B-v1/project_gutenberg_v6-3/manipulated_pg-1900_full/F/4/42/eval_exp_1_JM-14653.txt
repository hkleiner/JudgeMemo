1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst", "thou" implied in style) might require additional mental processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow and lengthy, meandering paragraphs can disrupt the reader's engagement.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between philosophical reflection, personal anecdote, and argumentative sections without clear transitional phrases.
