Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "tearfully" vs. "tearfully" not found, but "whiled" instead of "whiled" in context, and "was" instead of "were" in a few places)
  - [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common or archaic vocabulary without clear explanation (e.g., "tewky", "bawbee", "fash")
  - [SYNTAX] Infrequent complex sentence structures that slightly hinder flow

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Chapters and sections sometimes feel loosely connected to an overarching narrative
  - [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters or topics could be smoother
  - [CLARITY] A few instances where historical or cultural context assumes prior knowledge

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: 4

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: 4.5
