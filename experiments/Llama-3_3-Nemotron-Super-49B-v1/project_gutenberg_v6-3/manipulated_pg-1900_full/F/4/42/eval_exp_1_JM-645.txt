Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "vivified") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures (e.g., Chapter I's opening paragraph) can disrupt flow.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] None noted in the provided text snippet.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Corvick's quest and the narrator's reflections) might confuse without close attention.
   - [CLARITY] The central mystery (Vereker's secret) remains unclear, potentially frustrating readers seeking resolution.
   - [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt, lacking smooth connectivity (e.g., from Chapter IV to V).

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
