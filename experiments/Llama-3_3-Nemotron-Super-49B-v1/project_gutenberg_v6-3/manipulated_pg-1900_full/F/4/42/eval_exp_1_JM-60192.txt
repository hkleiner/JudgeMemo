Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SPELLING] "altho" (should be "although") appears multiple times
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in some places)
   - [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thoroly", "moulting") may hinder readability for some readers
   - [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences in some chapters (e.g., CINNAMON AND CASSIA) impair flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between some chapters
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed, dense information in certain sections (e.g., NUTMEG AND MACE) may confuse non-expert readers
   - [LOGIC] No apparent logical connection or flow between the final chapter (CUMIN, OR CUMMIN SEED) and the preceding ones, aside from the spice theme

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
