Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
   - [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "verily") might reduce accessibility for modern readers without a literary or religious background.

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] The extensive narrative, while mostly linear, could benefit from clearer transitional markers between chapters for enhanced flow.
   - [CLARITY] Depth of theological and historical context assumes a baseline understanding that not all readers may possess, potentially leading to confusion.

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
