Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some chapters (e.g., Chapter V, Letter) can disrupt flow.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] A few minor typos (e.g., "who's" instead of "whose" in Chapter X) but overall very clean.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative (e.g., Chapter V's letter) can momentarily confuse without prior context.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Chapter VI to VII without clear temporal or contextual bridge.
   - [LOGIC] The introduction of Satan in Chapter VI feels somewhat out of place and convenient.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
