Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but implied by overall style) and overly formal tone might reduce accessibility for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in biographical sections slightly disrupts chronological flow.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive art analysis and biographical information in some chapters.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
