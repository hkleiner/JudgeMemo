Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary (e.g., "dusker", "vaguer", "emphyrean") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter IV's opening paragraph) can disrupt flow.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in "our geese was good", missing articles in some descriptions).

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter III and IV without clear temporal or contextual bridge.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Herold's initial feigned illness) could be more clearly introduced.
   - [TRANSITION] The revelation of Herold's past feels somewhat rushed and could benefit from more setup.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
