Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "queek" instead of "peek", "thrumpty" instead of a recognizable word, "caned" instead of "couldn't")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I donâ€™t like to mentioned the _real_ figure for fear of perverting the present generation of boys by my monstrous confession")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "gallimaufry", "sartor", "mulled claret")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., shifting from Goody Twoshoes to reminiscences of the author's youth)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly verbose or meandering, making the main point hard to follow
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between chapters ("ON SOME CARP AT SANS SOUCI", "DE JUVENTUTE", "ROUND ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS TREE")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
