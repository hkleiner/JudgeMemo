Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst" and similar) and domain-specific terms without explanation might challenge non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy paragraphs and lack of clear sectioning (beyond the initial title) can make navigation difficult.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between historical periods could be more explicitly signaled for smoother reading.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
