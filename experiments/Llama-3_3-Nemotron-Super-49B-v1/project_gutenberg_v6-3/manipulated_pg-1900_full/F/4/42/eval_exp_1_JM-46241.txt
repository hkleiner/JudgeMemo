Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "medi√¶val", "thou") might require additional effort for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of non-standard spellings (e.g., "colour" instead of "color") for a US audience, though correct in British English.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of books and broader thematic discussions without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical art and printing terms without explanation may confuse non-expert readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
