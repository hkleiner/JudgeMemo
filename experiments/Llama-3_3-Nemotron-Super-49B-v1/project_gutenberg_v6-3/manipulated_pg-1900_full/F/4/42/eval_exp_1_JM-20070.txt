Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in "they was long as those of summer-childhood")
  - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "tearfull" instead of "tearful", though not explicitly found, the text's length suggests potential overlooked typos)
  - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "suffocated with anticipation")
  - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some areas (e.g., Chapter III's opening paragraph) might impede smooth reading

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter IV and V without clear temporal or spatial cues
  - [CLARITY] Some character motivations and backstories (e.g., Marjorie's past love) feel somewhat disconnected from the immediate narrative
  - [TRANSITION] The shift in focus from the wedding to the beach scene (Chapter III) could be more seamless

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: 4

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: 4.5
