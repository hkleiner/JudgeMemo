Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "tear" instead of "tear" is not an issue, but actual examples include "was" instead of "were" in "You was certainly very natural in America")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the family were" instead of "the family was" in some contexts)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "gibber", "thou")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt transitions between chapters without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and long paragraphs reduce clarity
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some scenes (e.g., the shift from Virginia's disappearance to the search party)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
