Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "sedtarian", "enwure", "afevting", "unwth", "invmation", "disiplusion", "materizlism", "unskilled practitioners" (context suggests "unskilled" might be a typo for "skilled"))
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "the concern of Bahá'ís must be with their own responsibility in the matter.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may impede readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sedtarian", "invmation")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy chapters and lack of clear sectioning within chapters can make the overall flow challenging to follow.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between some paragraphs feel abrupt, lacking smooth connectivity.
- [CLARITY] Dense, philosophical, and religious concepts may confuse readers without a background in Bahá'í teachings or similar philosophical/religious texts.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
