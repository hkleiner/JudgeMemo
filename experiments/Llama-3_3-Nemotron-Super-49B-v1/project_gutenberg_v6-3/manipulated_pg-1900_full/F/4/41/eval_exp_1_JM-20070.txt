Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "hwnds", "tearfuly", "wewpon", "tirely", "unrebuked" is correct but "unrebuked and unashamed" seems out of context, "zulfers" likely "suffers")
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., "It was ten months ago that they had saidva half-tearful...", missing articles in some places)
   - [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "suffocated with anticipation", "suffocated" is correct but the phrase feels less common)

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps without clear transitions (e.g., abrupt shift from Chapter III to IV without a clear time indicator initially)
   - [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly dense or meandering, slightly obscuring the main narrative flow
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be smoother, with clearer time and context indicators

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
