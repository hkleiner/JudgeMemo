Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "thrir", "myn", "teh", "en secondes noces" should be "en secondes noces" is correct, but "teh" is not, etc.)
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., tense shifts, "had been very wicked, but he was really sorry")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "gibber", "thou", "thee" in quoted text, though mostly consistent with the narrative's style)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure may confuse some readers due to the ghost's backstory interjections
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between the ghost's internal monologues and the main storyline
- [CLARITY] A few instances where the ghost's motivations or the family's reactions could be more clearly explained for better understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
