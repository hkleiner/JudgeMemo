Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "teh", "recieve", "acknowledgments" is correct but "acknowledgments" is also acceptable, "thier" instead of "their")
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I will call at three to-day.")
   - [LEXICON] Some outdated or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may affect readability for modern readers
   - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of commas in dialogue and narrative

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can be slightly confusing without clear transitional cues between chapters
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Mr. Wallace's intense dislike for musicians) feel underdeveloped or abruptly introduced
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the romantic storyline to the supernatural element (Introduction of Satan) may jar some readers

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
