Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It is permissible to note with pleasure the few cases in which an artist reveals himself aw an accomplished man of the world.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst" in some contexts, though largely appropriate for the subject's era)

- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in some sections, potentially disorienting readers
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biographical details, art analysis, and historical context without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences or paragraphs requiring re-reading for full comprehension
