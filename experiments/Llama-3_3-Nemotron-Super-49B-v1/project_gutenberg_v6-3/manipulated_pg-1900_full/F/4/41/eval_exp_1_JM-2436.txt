Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "What made the case worse...") 
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected
   - [SYNTAX] Some long, convoluted sentences impair readability (e.g., Chapter III opening)
   - [LEXICON] Rich vocabulary, but occasional overuse of less common words may hinder flow for some readers

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Character motivations (e.g., Godfrey's sudden change, Mrs. Churchley's consistent honor) sometimes feel unexplained or inconsistent
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between chapters) can disorient without clear transitional cues
   - [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., character appearances, settings) sometimes overshadow plot progression
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in scene or topic without smooth linking (e.g., end of Chapter II to Chapter III)
