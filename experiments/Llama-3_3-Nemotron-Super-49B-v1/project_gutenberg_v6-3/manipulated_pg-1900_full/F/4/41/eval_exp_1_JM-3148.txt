Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "teh", "wver", "nukky" instead of "nunky", "thd" instead of "the", "Lyddy" vs. "Lydia" inconsistency)
   - [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "doth", "whilst", "thou") might require additional effort for modern readers

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between past and present without clear transitions)
   - [CLARITY] A few sections with overly poetic or abstract descriptions might confuse some readers
   - [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt without a clear narrative bridge
