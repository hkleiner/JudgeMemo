Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in several places (e.g., "was" and "is" in the same context).
   - [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "thith", "titanium was found as abundantly in Irwadian soil as aluminum is found in the soil of an Earth-style planet" - likely "abundantly" is correct, but context suggests a comparison issue).
   - [LEXICON] Overuse of less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "splay-tongued", while creative, may hinder flow for some readers).
   - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in a few instances hinder clarity (e.g., the long, descriptive paragraphs without clear paragraph breaks).

2. **Coherence Issues**:
   - [LOGIC] The transition from the spaceport conflict to the revelation of Vardin's true nature feels abrupt.
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative elements (e.g., the vision of proto-man) could be more seamlessly integrated.
   - [CLARITY] Overly complex scientific explanations (e.g., the nature of time in hyper-space) might confuse some readers.
   - [TRANSITION] The shift in Margot's character from power-driven to loving feels somewhat rushed.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
