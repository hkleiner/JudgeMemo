Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple archaic spellings (e.g., "waz", "distdict", "ghe", "dsu", "teh", "vnto", "thou" in non-quotative contexts) and inconsistent use of modern English spellings.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "fellahin", "rabisu", "Pidati", "Shirtani") may hinder readability for non-specialists.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter III's opening paragraph) that impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shift from Tell el Amarna discovery to Egyptian Court Administration without clear transition).
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, detailed historical content without sufficient summarization or contextualization for general readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between chapters (e.g., Chapter IV to V) and some topics (e.g., introduction of the Habiri/Hebrews).
