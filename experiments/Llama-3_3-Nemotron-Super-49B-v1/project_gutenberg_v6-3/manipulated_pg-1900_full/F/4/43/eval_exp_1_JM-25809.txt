Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in some sections.
   - [SPELLING] Occasional archaic or non-standard spellings (e.g., "tear" instead of "tier", "der" instead of "the" in dialogue, which might be intentional for character voice).
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some narrative parts (e.g., "tint", "insoluble problem", "gilds the tin cans") that might hinder smooth reading for all audiences.
   - [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences, especially in descriptive passages.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps without clear transitions (e.g., sudden shift from Jim's mining to the boy's backstory).
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations and backstories are vaguely introduced (e.g., the full context of Jim and Anne's relationship, the boy's past).
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt scene changes (e.g., from the tunnel collapse to the miners' arrival) without smoothing transitions.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**
