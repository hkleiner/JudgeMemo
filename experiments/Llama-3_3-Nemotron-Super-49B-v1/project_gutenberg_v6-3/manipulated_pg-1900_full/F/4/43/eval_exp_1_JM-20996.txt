Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., Chapter III, "had never fallen to the lot of the writer to cook" followed by "he refused to learn at that late day")
- [SPELLING] Possible typos (e.g., "St. Vitus" in Chapter V, context suggests a different reference or typo)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whip-cords", "coup de main") may hinder readability for some readers
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter VIII, "What an indissoluble enigma is life...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shift from describing Manila to discussing life in quiet hamlets without clear transition)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences or conclusions (e.g., Chapter VI, "House-keeping in the Philippines")
- [TRANSITION] Weak connections between chapters (e.g., from "A Drama in Actual Life" to "What the Teachers Did")
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge (e.g., specifics of Filipino history or customs without explanation)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
