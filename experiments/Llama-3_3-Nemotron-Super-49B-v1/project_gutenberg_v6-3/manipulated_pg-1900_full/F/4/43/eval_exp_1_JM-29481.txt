Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs could improve with simpler, more modern phrasing for better flow.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] No major errors detected, but a few commas could be added for clarity in long sentences.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Chapter XI to XII without clear transition, disrupting flow.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Old Sanders' sudden depth) feel underdeveloped or introduced too late.
   - [TRANSITION] The shift from the musical, romantic plot to the mystery of the violin's fifth string and its consequences could be more seamlessly integrated.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
