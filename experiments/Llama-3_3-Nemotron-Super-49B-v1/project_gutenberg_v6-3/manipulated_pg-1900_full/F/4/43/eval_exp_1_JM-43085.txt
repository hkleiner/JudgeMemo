Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "mephistophelian", "vibrant" in a non-standard context) may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are excessively long and convoluted, disrupting the flow (e.g., the paragraph discussing Meissonier's color sense).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different periods of Meissonier's life and artistic themes without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing the reader.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, making the connection to the overall narrative unclear at first glance.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
