Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative reason)
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "end on place miles of Richmond Washington" likely should be "end of the peace in the countryside around Richmond and Washington")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Most end on place miles of Richmond Washington the the countryside peace period this taken rolling it war the in capitals the the East")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between chapters feel abrupt without clear summary or preview of the strategic shift (e.g., from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., discussing the Weldon Railroad in different chapters without clear chronological flow)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder understanding of military strategies for non-expert readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
