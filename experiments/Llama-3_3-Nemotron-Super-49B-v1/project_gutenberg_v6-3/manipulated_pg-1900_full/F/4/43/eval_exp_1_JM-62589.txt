Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., Chapter IV, "entered upon" instead of "entered")
   - [SPELLING] Occasional typos (e.g., "tearfull" instead of "tearful", though not frequently encountered)
   - [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "thou", "thee" in dialogue, which, however, suits the historical context)
   - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some descriptions may hinder immediate clarity

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling in later chapters slightly disrupts the flow from the initial narrative focus
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Debby's story to Molly's without clear initial connection (later resolved)
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations and backstories (e.g., Morley's) could be more explicitly stated for immediate understanding

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
