Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] A few sentences are excessively long and convoluted, potentially disrupting flow.
   - [SPELLING/Grammar] No major errors detected, but some archaic language (e.g., "jest", "thou") might affect modern readability.

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Anthony's backstory and present) might confuse without careful attention.
   - [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt, lacking smooth connectivity.
   - [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., Aunt Hitty's depth of funeral planning enthusiasm) feel somewhat exaggerated or unclear in their depth.
