Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "be could seen blood no-of moments few the." (incoherent sentence structure and missing words)
- [SYNTAX] "The so conversation the often presentation not of, there even ghosts way primary were expectations upon which of those conditions so turned precede no receptive in psychical phenomena." (extremely convoluted and unclear sentence)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "gibber", "furbish")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., being hit by a pillow, using a dagger) contradicts typical ghost lore and is not consistently explained.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between the ghost's backstory and present interactions) can disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden desire for sleep, Virginia's immediate empathy) feel underdeveloped or abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
