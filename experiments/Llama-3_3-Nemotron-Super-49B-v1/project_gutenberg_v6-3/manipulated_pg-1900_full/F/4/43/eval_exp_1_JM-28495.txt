Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues:**
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in some chapters (e.g., Chapter III).
   - [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (e.g., "whilst" is used, which, while correct, may affect readability for some).
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding (e.g., Chapter V, describing Excalibur's actions).
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" in dialogue, "gas was administered with a bicycle pump") may reduce fluency for modern readers.

2. **Coherence Issues:**
   - [LOGIC] Minor inconsistencies in character actions (e.g., Excalibur's ability to understand and respond to complex situations).
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling in some parts (e.g., Chapter VII's abrupt shift to the train accident) may disrupt flow.
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., the curate's decision to leave) could be more explicitly stated for clarity.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from Chapter VI to VII) without clear temporal or contextual bridges.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score:** **4**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score:** **4.5**
