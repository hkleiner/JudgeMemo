Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "And now, to her beauty was added an adorable friendliness and confidence, free from the slightest taint of self-consciousness or the least blemish of coquetry.")
   - [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern narrative (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "thee" not present but similar tone)
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected
   - [SYNTAX] Infrequent but noticeable long, winding sentences impairing immediate clarity

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps without clear transitions (e.g., abrupt shift from Chapter III to IV without summarizing the week's passage)
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations and backstories (especially Herold's) revealed abruptly without prior hinting
   - [LOGIC] The rapid development of Marche's love for Molly might feel unrealistic to some readers
   - [TRANSITION] Chapters could benefit from clearer transitional phrases or summaries to enhance flow

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
