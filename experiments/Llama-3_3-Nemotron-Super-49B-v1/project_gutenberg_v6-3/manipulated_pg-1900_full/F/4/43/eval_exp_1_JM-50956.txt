Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in some chapters (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear reason)
- [SPELLING] Occasional typos (e.g., "the the", "in in", "somewhile" instead of "sometimes")
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences impairing readability (e.g., in the "New Opportunities for the Allies" chapter)
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases ("at the same time", "in the meantime") without variation

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about historical outcomes without explicit evidence (e.g., claiming Germany would have won without Russia's intervention)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological presentation in some sections disrupts flow (e.g., discussing 1917 events before fully concluding 1916)
- [CLARITY] Overly technical military terms without explanation for non-expert readers
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing Ludendorf's memoirs and broader strategic impacts

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
