Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some sections.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "medi√¶val", "thou") and specialized terminology (e.g., "rubrishers", "typefounder") might challenge modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spellings (e.g., "colour" instead of "color") and inconsistent hyphenation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing woodcut books, illuminated manuscripts, and the broader context of medieval art without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly dense with names, dates, and book titles, making it hard to discern the main point.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analyzing specific books to a philosophical discussion on the nature of art and book design.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
