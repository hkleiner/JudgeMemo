Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in some chapters (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative reason)
   - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "teh" instead of "the" in one instance, though rare)
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly formal or outdated vocabulary (e.g., "whilst" in modern context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Chapters sometimes feel loosely connected to an overarching narrative or thematic progression
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between anecdotal examples and broader educational discussions without clear linking phrases
   - [CLARITY] A few paragraphs require re-reading due to complex sentence structures or assumed background knowledge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
