Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "repaire", "fice to fice") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Chapter III's opening paragraph) can disrupt flow.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] The abrupt introduction of Mrs. Godfrey (Chapter IV) feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative.
   - [STRUCTURE] The non-linear progression of emotional consequences and revelations (e.g., Godfrey's situation) might confuse some readers.
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Adela's immediate trust in her actions being right) are sometimes assumed rather than fully explained.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
