Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "doth", "whilst") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences in some chapters (e.g., Chapter II) might impede smooth reading flow.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Anthony's past and present) without clear transitional markers.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Aunt Hitty's funeral planning zeal) feel slightly disconnected from the main narrative arc.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between poetic descriptions and dialogue (e.g., in Chapter IV) can disrupt narrative cohesion.
