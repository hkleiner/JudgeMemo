Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "tejas" vs. "Tejas" in different contexts, though this could also be stylistic)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "booted heel" in poetic sections)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some historical descriptions may slow reading flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative can be disorienting without a clear timeline overview at the outset
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between poetic introduction and historical chapters without clear transitional elements
- [CLARITY] Some historical events and figures are introduced without sufficient background for unfamiliar readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
