1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some chapters (e.g., Chapter "In addition to disillusionment...") can impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression of ideas across chapters may confuse readers expecting a strictly sequential argument.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing historical context, philosophical themes, and the Bahá'í Faith's teachings without clear transitional phrases.
