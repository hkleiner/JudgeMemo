Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "gild", "faux pas" might be less common) could slightly hinder modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally jumps between biographical events and artistic analysis without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 18th-century art and historical figures might reduce clarity for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
