1. **Fluency Issues**:

   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "coram populo", "scullery") might require additional context for all readers.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between chapters) without clear transitional cues.
   - [CLARITY] A few sections assume prior knowledge of British culture or historical context that might confuse some readers.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous anecdotes and more serious themes.
