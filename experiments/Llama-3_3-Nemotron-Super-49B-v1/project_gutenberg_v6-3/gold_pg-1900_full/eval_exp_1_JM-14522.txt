Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] None notable (text appears to be a classic, pre-proofread version with expected archaic spellings)
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex, lengthy sentences may impede immediate understanding
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but other terms like "gibber", "ruff") might challenge modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in some chapters (e.g., ghost's backstory)
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., ghost's sudden emotional depth) could be more explicitly stated
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
