Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "char-Ã -banc", "pate de foie") might require reader effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Character motivations (especially Adolphe's sudden compliance) could be more deeply explored for full believability.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative's pacing, while generally well-managed, has a somewhat abrupt conclusion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
