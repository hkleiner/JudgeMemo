Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "teh" instead of "the" in some places, though not prevalent)
  - [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures may slightly impede flow for younger readers
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "whang") might require explanation for modern readers

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Chapters and scenes transition well, but some sub-scenes (e.g., the sudden shift to making a telephone) could be more smoothly integrated
  - [CLARITY] A few character actions or dialogue intentions might be slightly unclear without close attention (e.g., Tom's motivations for some actions)
