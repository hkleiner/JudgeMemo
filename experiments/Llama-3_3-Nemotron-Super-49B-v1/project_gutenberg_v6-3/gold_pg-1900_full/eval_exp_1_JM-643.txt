Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "telegrams", "valet de place") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures (e.g., Chapter I's opening paragraph) can impede smooth reading.
   - [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between chapters without clear transitions) can disorient readers.
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Mrs. Wimbush's true intentions) and plot points (e.g., the significance of the lost manuscript) are not fully clarified.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages and dialogue (e.g., in Chapter IV) disrupt flow.

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
