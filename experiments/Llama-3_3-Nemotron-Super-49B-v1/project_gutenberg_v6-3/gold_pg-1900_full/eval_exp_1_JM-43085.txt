   - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") might require additional context for modern readers.

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between biography, art critique, and historical context without clear transitional markers.
   - [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of 19th-century French art and history may leave some readers disconnected from the subject's significance.
