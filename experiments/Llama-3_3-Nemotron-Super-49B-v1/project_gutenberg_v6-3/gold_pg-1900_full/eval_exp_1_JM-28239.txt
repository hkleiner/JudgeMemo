Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "Boonesborough" vs. "Boonesboro" not present, but potential for other minor variations)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "happened upon", "whilst")
- [SYNTAX] Infrequent use of complex sentence structures can make the text feel somewhat flat or simplistic in places

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can slightly disorient readers (e.g., jumping between historical figures without clear transitions)
- [TRANSITION] Some chapter transitions feel abrupt, lacking smooth connectivity between topics
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs overwhelm with names/dates without clear contextual significance to the broader narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
