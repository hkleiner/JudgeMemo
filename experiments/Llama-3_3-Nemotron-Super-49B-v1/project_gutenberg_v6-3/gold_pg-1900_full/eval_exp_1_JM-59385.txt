Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutung", "Lanterns Festival" context) might require additional context for modern readers.
  - [SPELLING/Grammar] **None Noted** (Assuming the text's intentional stylistic choices, such as dashes for scene transitions, are not considered errors)

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between past, present, and reflective moments) without clear transitional markers.
  - [CLARITY] Depth of cultural context assumed; some customs and references might confuse readers without a background in early 20th-century Chinese culture.
  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between deeply personal moments and broader narrative sweeps.

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: 4

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: 4.5
