Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some vocabulary is somewhat archaic (e.g., "commercial men of prominence") but does not hinder understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Chapters are coherent individually but transitions between could be smoother.
   - [CLARITY] A few instances where the connection between anecdotes and the main point could be clearer.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
