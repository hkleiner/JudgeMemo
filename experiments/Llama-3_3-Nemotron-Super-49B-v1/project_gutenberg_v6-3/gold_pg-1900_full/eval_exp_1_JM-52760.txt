Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long compound sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "chevaux-de-frise", "abatis") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between detailed battle descriptions and broader strategic overviews without clear transitional paragraphs.
- [CLARITY] Assuming prior knowledge of the Civil War context; minimal background provided for events or figures outside the immediate campaign.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
