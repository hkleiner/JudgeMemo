- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., Chapter: THE WEDDING AT CANA) might impede smooth flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between biographical, artistic, and historical contexts without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of art history and 16th-century Venice context may confuse uninformed readers.
