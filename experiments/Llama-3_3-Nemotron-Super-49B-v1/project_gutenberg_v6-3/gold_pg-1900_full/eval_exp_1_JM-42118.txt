- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst") might hinder modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between Fragonard's life, historical events, and artistic analysis, potentially disorienting readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between detailed biography and broader cultural commentary lack smooth connectors.
