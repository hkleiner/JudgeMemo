Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "verily") may hinder readability for modern readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures in some chapters (e.g., "THE DECLARATION IN THE RIDVÁN GARDEN") can impede smooth flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between historical context and philosophical discussions) without clear transitional markers.
   - [CLARITY] Some sections assume prior knowledge of Bahá’í history or religious context, potentially confusing unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
