Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thereof") might confuse modern readers.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but archaic spellings (e.g., "Cataract" for "Catapult" context unclear, assuming "Cataract" is correct as it refers to a waterfall) could distract.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between historical periods and topics.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions and lack of clear transitions between chapters.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about historical figures' actions (e.g., Etienne Brule being the first white visitor) without clear evidence.
