Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "narrowing nunnery walls", "tesserae" not defined)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter IV's opening paragraph)
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but some archaic spellings (e.g., "thou", "thee") may confuse modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative can be disorienting at times
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge of historical figures and architectural terms without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural descriptions and historical anecdotes (e.g., Chapter I to II)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
