Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long compound sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "laid across the road to form a hard surface" for plank roads) might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from historical context to the specifics of the Petersburg campaign without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the Civil War's broader context (e.g., the significance of certain battles or generals without brief explanation).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
