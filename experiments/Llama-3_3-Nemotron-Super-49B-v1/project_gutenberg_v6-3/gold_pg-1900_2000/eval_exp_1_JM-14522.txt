Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sanguineous", "gyves") might require additional cognitive effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the family's daily activities to the ghost's appearance without a clear transitional phrase in Chapter II.
- [CLARITY] The shift in tone from humorous skepticism to supernatural encounter, while effective, might slightly disorient some readers due to its swiftness.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
