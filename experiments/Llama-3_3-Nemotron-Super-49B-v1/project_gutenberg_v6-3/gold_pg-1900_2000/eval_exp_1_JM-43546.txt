Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., "For many days after he had found the puppy, Donald would rush home from school...") 
- [LEXICON] Some overly formal or less common vocabulary for a children's narrative (e.g., "bonnie", "wee bairn", "clannish") 
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent use of varied punctuation for dramatic effect (mostly reliant on periods and commas)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the preface and the start of the story ("CHAPTER: THE FINDING OF 'ROB ROY'")
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of Scottish culture and terms without explanation for a potentially non-Scottish audience (e.g., "shortbread", "scones", "loch")
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., from the puppy to planning a visit to Uncle Alan's without a clear connector)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
