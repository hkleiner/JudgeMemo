Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long descriptive sentences).
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld", "requisite") might challenge modern readers.
   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from historical context to personal experience in Chapter I.
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions (e.g., of the robe, surf-shooting) slightly detract from the main narrative flow.
   - [TRANSITION] Chapter II starts somewhat disconnected from the climax of Chapter I (crossing the date line).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
