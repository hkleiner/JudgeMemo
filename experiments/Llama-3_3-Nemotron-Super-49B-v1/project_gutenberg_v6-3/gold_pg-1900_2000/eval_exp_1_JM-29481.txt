Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "thraldom", "luminescent" not present but similar tone).
   - [SYNTAX] A few sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., Diotti's reflective monologue in Chapter III).

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical conversation in Chapter I to the concert scene in Chapter II without clear narrative bridge.
   - [CLARITY] Diotti's sudden depth of despair in Chapter II feels somewhat unprepared for, given the preceding interactions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
