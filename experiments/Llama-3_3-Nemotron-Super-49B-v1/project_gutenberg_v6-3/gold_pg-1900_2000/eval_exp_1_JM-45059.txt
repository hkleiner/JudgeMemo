Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "one-horse carrierâ€™s cart", "post boy") might require clarification for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] "Peterboro'" (archaic spelling, though consistent in context) and potential minor typos (e.g., "Yon" instead of "You").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from toll bars to breweries without clear transition).
- [CLARITY] Some anecdotes (e.g., the calculating boy, the witness story) feel tangential, slightly disrupting focus.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between describing the city's past and personal anecdotes.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
