Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "inescapable", "millennialist", "inconceivable") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be more explicitly signposted for smoother navigation.
   - [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally shifts between biographical detail and thematic exposition without clear sectioning.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
