Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "irksome task", "relinquish", "penurious") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly between Rosa's personal development and broader family events without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, making the connection to the overall narrative slightly less transparent.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
