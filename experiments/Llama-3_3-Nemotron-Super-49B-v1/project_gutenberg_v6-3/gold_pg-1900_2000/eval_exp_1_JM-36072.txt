Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "Chauvinism") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between historical periods and ideas could be more explicitly signposted.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Von Eicken, the Hammonds) might reduce accessibility.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
