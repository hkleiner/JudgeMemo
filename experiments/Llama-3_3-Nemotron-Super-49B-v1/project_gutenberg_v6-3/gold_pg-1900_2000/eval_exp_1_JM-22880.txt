Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "mikille", "thou") and less common terms (e.g., "apsidal east ending") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative may confuse readers without a timeline or clear sectioning.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about historical figures/events (e.g., St. Brice's Day massacre) without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
