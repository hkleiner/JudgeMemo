Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic or less common vocabulary choices (e.g., "thou", "whilst" not present but similar antiquated feel in some phrasings) might slightly hinder fluency for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel market scene to Kuei Pingâ€™s memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition).
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure, while effective, may momentarily disorient readers not expecting the flashback.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
