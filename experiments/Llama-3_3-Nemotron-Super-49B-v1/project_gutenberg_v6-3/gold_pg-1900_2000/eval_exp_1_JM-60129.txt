Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "tshokh", "lan", "kop" might confuse without context) could slightly hinder understanding for non-specialists.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive narrative, ethnographic detail, and historical legend without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about geographical locations (e.g., Gobi Desert, Nan-shan mountains) and cultural references (e.g., Khirgis, Tangutan) might reduce clarity for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
