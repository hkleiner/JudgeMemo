Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "cuirassiers", "manoeuvres") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between "INTRODUCTION" and "EARLY YEARS" could be smoother, with a clearer link between Meissonier's anecdote and his early life.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs are densely packed with information, potentially overwhelming the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
