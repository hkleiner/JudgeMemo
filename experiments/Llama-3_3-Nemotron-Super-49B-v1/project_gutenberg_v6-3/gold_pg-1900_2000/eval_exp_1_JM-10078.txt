Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Formal, somewhat archaic vocabulary (e.g., "duly received", "endeavour", "whilst") might reduce accessibility for non-native or younger readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The lengthy introduction before the main topic ("CHAPTER: I") might delay the core argument's presentation.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be more explicit to guide the reader smoothly through the author's points.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
