Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "telescopes", "horizon blue" without immediate context for modern readers) might require additional mental processing.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from personal struggle to enter the war zone to descriptive scenes without clear transitional phrases).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge (e.g., historical context of the war, specific locations' significance) without brief explanations for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
