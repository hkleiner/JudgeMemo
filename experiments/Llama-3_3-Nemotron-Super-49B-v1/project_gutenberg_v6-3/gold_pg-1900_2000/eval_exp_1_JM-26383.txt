Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thou") and overly formal tone might challenge modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between biographical details and historical context without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, tangential information (e.g., the etymology of "Lichfield") sometimes distracts from the main subject.
