Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, potentially distracting)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "th" for "th" sounds in Irwadian speech, may feel excessive
- [SYNTAX] Some long, complex sentences (e.g., Ramsey's thoughts on Irwadian pilots)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene changes (e.g., from Polaris to Englander's flat) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Background information (e.g., Irwadian history, Ramsey's past) could be more seamlessly integrated
- [LOGIC] The Earthgirl's ability to read minds feels unexplained and somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
