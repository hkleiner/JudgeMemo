Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "harrowing", "indefeasible") might require additional interpretation for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be more explicitly signposted for smoother flow.
   - [CLARITY] A few paragraphs blend multiple ideas without clear separation, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
