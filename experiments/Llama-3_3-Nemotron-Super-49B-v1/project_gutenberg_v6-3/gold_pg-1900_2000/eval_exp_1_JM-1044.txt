Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Archaic language usage (e.g., "warn’t", "ain’t") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., the comet race description) could improve with clearer segmentation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative (e.g., the abrupt shift from the comet race to arriving at the gates) slightly disrupts flow.
- [CLARITY] Some humor and satire rely on understanding 19th-century references (e.g., Columbus, San Francisco's significance), which might confuse contemporary readers without context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
