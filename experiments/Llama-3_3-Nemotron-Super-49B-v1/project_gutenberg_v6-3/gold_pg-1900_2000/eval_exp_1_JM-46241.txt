- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "medi√¶val", "rhetorical pedants") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing specific books and broader artistic trends without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of the subject (e.g., Renaissance impact on German art) are made without explanation.
