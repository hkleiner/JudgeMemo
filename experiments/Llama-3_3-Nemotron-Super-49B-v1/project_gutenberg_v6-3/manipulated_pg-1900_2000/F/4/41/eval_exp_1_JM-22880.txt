- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "The reader can form his own opinion as to which is the most probable of these three suggestions.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-specialists (e.g., "Mikille", "feffed", "kirkes of pris")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative may confuse some readers without a timeline or clear sectioning.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about historical figures and events (e.g., expecting readers to know who Ã†lfred or Swegen are without introduction).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing the abbey's structure and its historical events without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
