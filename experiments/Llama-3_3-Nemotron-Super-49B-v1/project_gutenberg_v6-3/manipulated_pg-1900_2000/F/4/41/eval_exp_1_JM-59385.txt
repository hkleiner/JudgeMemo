Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ky" (should be "my"), "brilluancy" (should be "brilliance"), "forsxward" (should be "forward"), "teh" (should be "the"), "zat" (should be "at"), "anility" (should be "ability"), "v" (used instead of "of" or other appropriate prepositions in multiple places), "intergals" (should be "intervals"), "zhad" (should be "had"), "qhere" (should be "where"), "gife" (should be "give"), "thm" (should be "them"), "awzited" (should be "awaited"), "waw" (should be "was")
- [GRAMMAR] "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with ky limited knowledge of her language could make it." (clunky structure), "Kuei Ping had seen her grandmother bargain before and so she scarce drew her attention away" (archaic "scarce" without clear modern context), "Tney awzited her return home" (inconsistent verb tense)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe", "aesthetic simplicity", "magnificence of the pageantry") might slightly impede readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a clearer connector).
- [CLARITY] The deep emotional conflict and its resolution could be more explicitly stated for immediate clarity.
- [TRANSITION] The shift between the detailed, present-tense market scene and the past-tense memory could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
