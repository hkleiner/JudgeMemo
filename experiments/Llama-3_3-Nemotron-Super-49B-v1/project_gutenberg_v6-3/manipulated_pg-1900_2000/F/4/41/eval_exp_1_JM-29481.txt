- [GRAMMAR] "had long been favorably commented on by the critics" (passive voice, though not incorrect, could be more engaging), "Perkins believed it" (lacks context for a stronger statement), "You must" (imperative in narrative, though likely an error in transcription)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical conversation to the concert scene without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Diotti's sudden and intense emotional state after the concert could be more clearly motivated or foreshadowed.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter II to Chapter III feels somewhat disjointed, lacking a smooth narrative link.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
