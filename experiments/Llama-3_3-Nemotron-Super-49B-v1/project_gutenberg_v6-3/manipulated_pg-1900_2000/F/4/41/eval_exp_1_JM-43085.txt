Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "indemnuties" (should be "indemnities"), "teavhers" (should be "teachers"), "pribation" (should be "privation"), "exorbitant sum of twenty francs" (contextually unclear if typo or factual inaccuracy), "fhe" (should be "the"), "dfagoons" (should be "dragoons"), "thd" (should be "the"), "jow" (should be "now"), "fromnwhich" (should be "from which"), "canvases that were generously paid for at five francs a meter" (potentially unclear unit, assuming typo for "per square meter")
- [SYNTAX] "It was not that he did not want to, or had not cherished the dream of doing so. Bur he had never seen a battle;" (missing conjunction or connector, "Bur" should be "But")
- [LEXICON] "lumbering and trammelled fligut" (unclear term, possibly "flight" or context-specific error), "in a vague way, would suffice to characterize the artist" (slightly awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to introducing Eug√®ne Delacroix without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] "the question of painting in France had been taking on a rather bitter tone" (could be more clearly contextualized for readers unfamiliar with the period).
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Meissonier's childhood to the broader art historical context feels somewhat disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
