Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "aureoled", "epulantium", "Vendigeid") might require additional effort for less knowledgeable readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction meanders, delaying the central topic, potentially confusing readers about the text's focus.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between the author's personal anecdotes, the story's conception, and the legend's evolution could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
