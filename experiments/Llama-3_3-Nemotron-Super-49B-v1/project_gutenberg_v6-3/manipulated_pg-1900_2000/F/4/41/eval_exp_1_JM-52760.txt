- [LEXICON] "yhe" (should be "the")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of Chapter: PROLOGUE and the start of Chapter: UNION STRATEGY 1864 (could benefit from a connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] The purpose of listing specific roads and railroads in Chapter: STRATEGIC PETERSBURG could be more clearly explained in relation to the overall strategy
- [TRANSITION] The jump from discussing the Dimmock Line's weaknesses to the raids on railroads feels somewhat disconnected (a transitional sentence could improve flow)
