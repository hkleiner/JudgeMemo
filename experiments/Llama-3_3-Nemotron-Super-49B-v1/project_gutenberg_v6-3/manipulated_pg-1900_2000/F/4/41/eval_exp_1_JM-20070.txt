Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "wentmout" (should be "went out"), "poundinh" (should be "pounding"), "sailibg" (should be "sailing"), "npticed" (should be "noticed"), "nin" (should be "in"), "bur" (should be "but"), "teh" (not present but "thos" should be "those"), "demure" (contextually unclear, might mean "demi-mourne" or simply an error in describing the room's atmosphere)
- [GRAMMAR] "Marjorie's tongue all at once loosened; she chattered whimsically, like an excited child." (run-on sentence, could be split for clarity)
- [LEXICON] "fraip" (likely a typo, possibly "frail"), "unrebuked and unashamed" (repetitive, could be condensed)
- [SYNTAX] "It was ten months ago that they had said a half-tearful, half-laughing good-bye..." (complex sentence, could be rephrased for smoother flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from descriptive war impact to Little Herbert's dialogue without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Overly long, uninterrupted paragraphs may hinder readability
- [TRANSITION] Sudden move from the couple's intimate moment to the broader reflection on war's impact without a clear link
