Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "thay", "nust", "mistakr", "kr", "olunged", "Noe")
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or informal language may affect readability for some readers (e.g., "warn’t", "you see" as a frequent filler)
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with a significant detour (the comet race) before returning to the main storyline, potentially confusing some readers
- [CLARITY] The transition from the space race to arriving at the heavenly gates could be smoother
- [LOGIC] Assumption of reader's familiarity with the original work's context ("Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven") without clear introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
