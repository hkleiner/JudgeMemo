Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "tehw" (should be "the"), "havimg" (should be "having"), "tyen" (should be "then"), "wojen" (should be "women"), "tje" (repeated, should be "the"), "cinquerors" (should be "conquerors"), "arose" (context suggests "arose" might be intended, but "were built" is more fitting), "lf" (should be "of"), "tjere" (should be "there"), "vprobably" (should be "probably"), "sultry" (contextually questionable, though not strictly incorrect), "Cahterbury" (should be "Canterbury"), "various" (redundant in "various careful antiquaries")
- [GRAMMAR] "on June 10 judgment was given in favour of Henry" (lacks clear subject-verb connection), "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "wonder-working" (archaic, may reduce clarity for some readers), "travel-soiled" (less common, could be clarified)
- [SYNTAX] "It would be a mistake to imagine that it solely was due to..." (awkward word order)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that modern pilgrims using railways are less devout than medieval ones is not fully justified.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing pilgrim routes to the history of Canterbury in Chapter II.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder understanding for non-expert readers (e.g., discussions of historical timelines and architectural analyses).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between historical periods in Chapter II.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
