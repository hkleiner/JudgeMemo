- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "You've got to avoid lanic. If you panic, you're finished....")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the Englander's flat without clear connection)
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and backstories feel hinted at but not fully integrated (e.g., Ramsey's past on Earth, the Earthgirl's telepathic ability)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between different plot points and character interactions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
