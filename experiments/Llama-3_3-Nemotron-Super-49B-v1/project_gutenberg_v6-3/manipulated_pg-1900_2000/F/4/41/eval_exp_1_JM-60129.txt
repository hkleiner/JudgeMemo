Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "behjnd", "andnwe", "texembled", "teh", "rhis", "thebdoor", "abMongolian", "bt", "rhints", "kf")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "at about twelve kilometrds from the town was the highest point reached that day")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity for non-specialist readers (e.g., assuming knowledge of specific geographical and cultural terms without explanation)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive narrative, ethnographic detail, and historical legend without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the region, its history, and cultural context may confuse some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts from describing the expedition's journey to detailed descriptions of the YÃ¶gur village life and customs.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
