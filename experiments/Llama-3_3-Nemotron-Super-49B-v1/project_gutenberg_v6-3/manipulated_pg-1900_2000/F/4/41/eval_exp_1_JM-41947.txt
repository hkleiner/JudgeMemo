Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor typos (e.g., "whobstepped", "cjurch", "vSeptember", "comwly", "fjghten", "wn", "bhe", "Boufher")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done, there was exchange of compliments...")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "dandified", "tipstaff", "doubls-florins")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between historical context and Boucher's life without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Overly dense historical and artistic references may confuse readers without prior knowledge
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters ("THE SMALL BEGINNINGS" to "THE STUDENT") without a clear connecting narrative thread
