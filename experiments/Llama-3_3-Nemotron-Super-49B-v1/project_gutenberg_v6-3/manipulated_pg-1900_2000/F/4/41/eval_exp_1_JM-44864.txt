Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "unicorn team", "thong", "dickey") might require explanation for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "fhe", "rhyme" instead of "rhe", "kile" instead of "mile", "knasmuch") detract from perfection.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical narrative, descriptive passages, and accident reports without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., "macadamisation") and coaching practices might confuse some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts from praising coachmen's skills to discussing their recklessness and accidents.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
