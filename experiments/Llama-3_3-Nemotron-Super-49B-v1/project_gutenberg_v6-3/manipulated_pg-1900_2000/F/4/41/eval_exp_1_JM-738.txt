Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "jovels", "demned", "omniouwly", "knid", "sith", "influencd", "gamin" likely meant "gamin" but contextually unclear, "Dfood" instead of "Drood")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and story summary (e.g., shifting from Dickens's health to character analysis without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs requiring re-reading for full comprehension
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between discussing different characters' introductions and their psychological states

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
