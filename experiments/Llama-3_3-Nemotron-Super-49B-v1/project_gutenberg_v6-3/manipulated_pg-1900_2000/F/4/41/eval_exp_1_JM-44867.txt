2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text could benefit from clearer transitional phrases between some paragraphs to enhance flow
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are somewhat convoluted, requiring re-reading for full comprehension (e.g., the explanation of the east-west analogy)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from moral implications to the example of wars feels somewhat abrupt
