Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "mf" (likely "of"), "tk" (likely "to"), "lrincesses" (likely "princesses"), "lrss" (likely "less"), "oeuvre" (repeated, though correct, may confuse some readers due to its less common usage in English texts)
- [GRAMMAR] "France to-day us sharply divided" (should be "is"), "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe, and long since came to the conclusion" (tense inconsistency)
- [SYNTAX] Some long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the first paragraph of the "However—to return to the war zone" section)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from discussing the bourgeoisie to the war zone without clear transition)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of French terms and historical context without explanation (e.g., "Zone des Armées", "the battle of the Somme")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from personal anecdotes to descriptive war scenes (e.g., from Paris society to the battlefield of the Marne)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
