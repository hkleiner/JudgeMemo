Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "HOWvDEBBY", "thixh", "laxne", "thou art tobtolerated", "thou art ashamdd", "ujtil", "mxde", "anx beganvto")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It mattered little to Debby wnether her father was Whig or Tory, no matter what he was she hungered for him day and night.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly anachronistic or overly formal for the narrative voice (e.g., "thou", "thee" in non-dialogue contexts, though this might be intentional for period effect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of Chapter I and the beginning of Chapter II without a clear temporal or thematic bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs have dense, unbroken narrative that could benefit from subdivision for easier follow-up (e.g., the long reflective paragraph in Debby’s room).
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency in character development expectations (e.g., the depth of Debby’s emotional reflection feels somewhat at odds with her portrayed age and experiences, though this is subjective).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
