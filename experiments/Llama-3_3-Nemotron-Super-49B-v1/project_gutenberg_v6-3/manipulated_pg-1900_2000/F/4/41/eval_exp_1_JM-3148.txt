Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "teand" instead of "tend", "sekt" instead of "seek", "thd" instead of "the", "yips" instead of "hips", "kandscape" instead of "landscape", "hegan" instead of "began", "secref" instead of "secret", "robbex" instead of "robbery", "hofs" instead of "hours", "rhe" instead of "the", "bsoul" instead of "soul", "themvillage" instead of "the village")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "He turned ever from the dead seven-times-six to the mystery of life about him.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common (e.g., "swan song" in this context, "liebling"), which might affect readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow may confuse some readers due to the abrupt shift from the present scene to Anthony's backstory without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly complex or verbose, potentially reducing immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of Anthony's inner world and questions).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
