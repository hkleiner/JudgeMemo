Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor typos (e.g., "injyrious", "themastern", "thd", "lprice", "nwoes", "drudge" context suggests a possible typo, though not certain)
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "peregrinations", "imposed on", "déjeuners", "eau sucré")
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative introduction before focusing on the main character, potentially causing initial disorientation
- [CLARITY] Some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the narrative's logical flow
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with the geographical locations' appeal without clear contextualization for all readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
