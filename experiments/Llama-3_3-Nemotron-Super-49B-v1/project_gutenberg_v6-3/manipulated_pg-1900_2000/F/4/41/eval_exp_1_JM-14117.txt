Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "rejain", "profwssions", "unforfunately", "om", "tl", "invin")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "it has been a failure for many years past is equally true")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "disquieting fact" is clear but "ejaculations of dismay" would better be "expressions of dismay" for clarity)
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences may impede flow (e.g., the first sentence of the text)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about why women avoid housework (e.g., lack of direct evidence provided for some claims)
- [STRUCTURE] Chapters could benefit from clearer transitional phrases between topics
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs convey multiple, loosely connected ideas (e.g., the discussion on marketing and telephone use)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
