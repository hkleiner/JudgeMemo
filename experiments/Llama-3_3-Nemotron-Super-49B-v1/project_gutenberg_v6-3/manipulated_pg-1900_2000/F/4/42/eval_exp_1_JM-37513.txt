Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "quasi-biological", "superorganic") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical explanation, and biographical critique without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Overly broad topics (e.g., Spencer's entire philosophical contribution) are discussed without sufficient depth or focus, potentially confusing the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
