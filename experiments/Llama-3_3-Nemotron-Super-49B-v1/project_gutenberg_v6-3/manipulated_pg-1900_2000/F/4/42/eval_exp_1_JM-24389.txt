Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "duskier and vaguer", "froze", "slangy") might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Marche's thoughts and the external scene without clear transitional phrases at times.
- [CLARITY] The character of Marche's motivations and the full context of the club's situation could be more explicitly stated for immediate understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
