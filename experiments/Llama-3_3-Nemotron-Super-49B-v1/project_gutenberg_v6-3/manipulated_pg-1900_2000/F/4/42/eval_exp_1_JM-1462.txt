- [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistent verb tense shifts (e.g., past to present without clear narrative reason)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between past, present, and fictional ghostly interactions
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts from describing the old lady's plight to historical references and fish at Sans Souci
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overly dense with unrelated historical and literary references, confusing the central theme
