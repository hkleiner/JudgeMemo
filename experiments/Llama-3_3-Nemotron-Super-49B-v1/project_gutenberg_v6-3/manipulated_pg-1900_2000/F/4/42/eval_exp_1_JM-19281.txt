Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some phrases (e.g., "harrowing consequences", "world-devouring fire") might be less accessible to non-native English readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between chapters could be more explicitly signposted.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs (e.g., discussing the shift in global consciousness) are densely packed with ideas, potentially overwhelming the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
