Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "mikille", "thou") and less common terms (e.g., "apsidal east ending") might require additional effort for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical periods without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about historical figures and architectural terms without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
