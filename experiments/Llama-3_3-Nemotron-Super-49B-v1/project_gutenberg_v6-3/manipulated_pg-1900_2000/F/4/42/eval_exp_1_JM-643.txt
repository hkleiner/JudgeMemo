Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "promiscuous lot", "opalinine robe") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression and abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from professional to personal reflections without clear connectors).
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of the literary context and characters (e.g., Mr. Deedy, Mr. Pinhorn's motivations) without sufficient introduction.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
