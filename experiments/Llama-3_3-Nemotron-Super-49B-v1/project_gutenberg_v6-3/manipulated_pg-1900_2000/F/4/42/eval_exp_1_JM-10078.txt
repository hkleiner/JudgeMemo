Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "deluging", "subservience") might reduce readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition into "CHAPTER: I" feels somewhat abrupt without a clear thematic bridge from the preceding paragraphs.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the recipient's prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., specific wartime events) could affect understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
