Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "And thus they meet." feels abrupt after detailed description)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thraldom", "proscenium", "chirography") might challenge modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear narrative link
- [CLARITY] Diotti's emotional shift from confidence to despair feels somewhat rushed and not fully explained

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
