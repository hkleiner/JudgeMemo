1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "Ã¦terno convivio", "groom of the chamber") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression with frequent shifts between past events, the story's conception, and its aftermath, potentially disorienting some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs or topics could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
