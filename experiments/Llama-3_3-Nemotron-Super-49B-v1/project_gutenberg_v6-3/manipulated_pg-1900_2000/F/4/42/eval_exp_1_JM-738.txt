Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "THE STORY" chapter without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Character relationships and backstories, while detailed, are introduced rapidly, potentially overwhelming the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
