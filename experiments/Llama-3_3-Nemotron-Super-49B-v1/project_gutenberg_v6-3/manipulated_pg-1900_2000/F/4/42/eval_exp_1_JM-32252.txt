Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "negociatores", "stewardship" implied but not listed) might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical periods and theoretical arguments without clear transitional phrases at times.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific economic theories (e.g., BÃ¼cher's, Sombart's) and historical events could hinder understanding for some.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
