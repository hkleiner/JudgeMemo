Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, potentially distracting)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "th" for "th" sounds in Irwadian speech, may feel excessive
- [SYNTAX] Some sentence structures are overly complex or wordy

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene changes (e.g., from Ramsey to the Earthgirl to Englander's flat) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Background information (e.g., Irwadian culture, Ramsey's past) sometimes feels info-dumped
- [LOGIC] The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
