Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "leisured class") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between historical periods and ideas could be more explicitly marked.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Von Eicken, Sybel, Tocqueville) without brief introductions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
