Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "come" should be "came" (e.g., "a young man... come to Canada")
- [GRAMMAR] "were" should be "was" (e.g., "The skeletons... were exhumed indicate")
- [GRAMMAR] "blazed a way which has since am known" should be "has since been known"
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded have to be launched" should be "would have to be launched"
- [SPELLING] "Lulbegrud Creek" (potential spelling inconsistency, though possibly correct if less common)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic language may impede modern readability (e.g., "lured by the possibility of reaching the Pacific by water")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from LaSalle's expedition to The Virginians and Daniel Boone without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The role of Simon Kenton in the broader narrative could be more clearly integrated
- [TRANSITION] The jump from describing settlements to how pioneers lived and fought feels somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
