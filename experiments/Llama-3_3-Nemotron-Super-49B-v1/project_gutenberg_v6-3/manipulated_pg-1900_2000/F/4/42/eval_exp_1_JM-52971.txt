Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "would had been nought" (should be "would have been naught")
- [SPELLING] "nought" (less common, though not incorrect, in American English; "naught" is more typical)
- [SYNTAX] "if only to break the humdrum of everyday existence" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "younger and agile only woulded attempt" (should be "only the young and agile would attempt"; "woulded" is incorrect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about Indians' curiosity without strong evidence
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing cave exploration to describing the environment
- [CLARITY] Overly speculative sections (e.g., the extent of Indian cave exploration)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between chapters (e.g., from "THE INDIANS..." to "EARLY MAN")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
