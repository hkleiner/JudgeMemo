Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "peregrinations", "salle à manger", "eau sucré") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative introduction (jumping between valley description and La Mère Bauche's story) could slightly disorient readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the narrative's cohesive feel.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
