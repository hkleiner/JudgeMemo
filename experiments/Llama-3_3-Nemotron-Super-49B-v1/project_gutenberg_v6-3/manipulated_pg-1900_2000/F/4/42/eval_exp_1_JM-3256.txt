Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "which mighted be" (incorrect verb form, should be "might be")
- [SPELLING] "thoroughly" (missing in context, not a direct error but "thorough" is used incorrectly in "thorough foot")
- [LEXICON] "tweetling" (uncommon/obsolete word, may cause confusion)
- [SYNTAX] "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire..." (complex sentence structure may impede flow for some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between anecdotes
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of literary references may confuse unfamiliar readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from defining "bookman" to discussing specific authors/books without clear connectors

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
