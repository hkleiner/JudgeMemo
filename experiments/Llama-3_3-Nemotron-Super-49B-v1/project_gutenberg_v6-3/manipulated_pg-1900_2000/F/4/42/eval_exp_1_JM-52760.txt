Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "capture on May 4, 1864" (should be "was captured")
- [SPELLING] "woulded" (should be "would")
- [SYNTAX] "the story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told" (somewhat abrupt transition)
- [LEXICON] "fearful loss of men" (archaic, though not incorrect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from discussing the Army of the James to the Army of the Potomac without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in strategic descriptions (e.g., Chapter: UNION STRATEGY 1864)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the end of Chapter: STRATEGIC PETERSBURG and the start of Chapter: BATTLE OF PETERSBURG

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
