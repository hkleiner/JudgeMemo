Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our friend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with him.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri", "bullock's heart") may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in verb tense (e.g., "We decide" instead of "We decided") and subject-verb agreement (e.g., "the conductor, who have kindly...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in Chapter I can be slightly disorienting without clear transitional cues
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from discussing dog breeds to the tram ride could benefit from a clearer connection
- [LOGIC] The assumption that following the official would lead them directly to the Home for Lost Dogs is overly simplistic and stretches credibility

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
