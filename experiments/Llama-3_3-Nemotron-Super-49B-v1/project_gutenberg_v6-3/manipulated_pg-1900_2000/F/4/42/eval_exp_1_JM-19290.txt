Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "inconceivable", "vermin-infested") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Bahá’u’lláh's global impact to his personal, detailed prison experience without a clear connecting sentence.
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumping between historical context, personal biography, and philosophical themes) may confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
