Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "futile noises", "salvoes", "ebullition") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs in Chapter Two could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
- [CLARITY] The shift from personal reflection to philosophical discussion in Chapter Two might slightly confuse readers without clearer signaling.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
