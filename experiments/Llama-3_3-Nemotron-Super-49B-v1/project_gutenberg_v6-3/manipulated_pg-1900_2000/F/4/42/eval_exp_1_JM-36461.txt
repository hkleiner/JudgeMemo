- [SPELLING] No errors noted, but archaic spellings (e.g., "tho'", "whomsoever") could affect readability.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure (jumping between biography, philosophical musings, and adventure) may disorient readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between sections (e.g., from Hannah's ancestors to her personal story) lack clear transitional phrases.
