Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "am trying" (should be "were trying"), "am alighting" (should be "were alighting"), "it might have am" (should be "it might have been")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "palsied", "savage pity"), which might affect readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., the paragraph describing Marjorie's thoughts on Leonard's appearance).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the emotional reunion to philosophical reflections on war without a clear transition.
- [CLARITY] Some sections, especially those reflecting on the broader impact of war, feel slightly disconnected from the immediate story of Marjorie and Leonard.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
