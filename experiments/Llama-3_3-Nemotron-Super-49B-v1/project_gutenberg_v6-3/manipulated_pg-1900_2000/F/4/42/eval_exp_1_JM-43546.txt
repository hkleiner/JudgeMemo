Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "which is wriggling about in the most extraordinary manner")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for a children's narrative (e.g., "whom", "thou")
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistency in verb tense ("have grown" instead of "had grown")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction of the puppy and the detailed description of the tea time
- [CLARITY] Overly lengthy descriptions interrupt the flow of the main storyline (e.g., detailed food descriptions)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between chapters and scenes (e.g., from finding the puppy to planning a visit)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
