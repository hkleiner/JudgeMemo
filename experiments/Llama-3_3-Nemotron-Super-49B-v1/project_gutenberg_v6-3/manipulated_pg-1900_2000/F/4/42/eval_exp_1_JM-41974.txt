Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "rainless", "thou", not present but potential for similar) could slightly hinder modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter: THE FIRST YEARS and the detailed description of Veronese's arrival in Venice.
   - [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 16th-century Venice and its artists might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
