Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have never have a very favorable opinion...")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "rendezvous" might be less common for some readers)
- [SPELLING] Minor potential typo ("to took" instead of "to have taken")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps without clear transitions (e.g., from war events to the dance story)
- [CLARITY] A few segments assume prior knowledge (e.g., context of "Forest's and Wheeler's cavalry" without introduction)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
