Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "he woulded come back" (incorrect verb conjugation)
- [SPELLING] "yondor" (likely "yonder", though contextually correct, could be a typo)
- [SYNTAX] "Debby have suffered" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may cause readability issues for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear temporal marker
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Mrs. Lane's deep investment in Debby) could be more clearly established
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Debby's emotional turmoil to the detailed historical context (e.g., battles) feels somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
