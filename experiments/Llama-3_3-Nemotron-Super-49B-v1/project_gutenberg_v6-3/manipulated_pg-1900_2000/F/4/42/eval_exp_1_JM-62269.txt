1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bedizened", "bivouacked") might require reader effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Chapter transitions could be smoother, with more explicit connections between scenes.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs have dense, packed descriptions that might overwhelm the reader.
