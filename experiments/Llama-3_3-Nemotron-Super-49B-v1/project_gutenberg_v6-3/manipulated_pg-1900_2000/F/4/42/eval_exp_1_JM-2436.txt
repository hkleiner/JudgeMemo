- [GRAMMAR] "he should tell Godfrey when he hadn’t take the occasion" should be "he hadn’t taken"

- [SPELLING] "hansoms" (correct, but less common; may cause pause for some readers)
- [LEXICON] "coruscating nod" (uncommon word, may reduce fluency for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] "the difference between “going on” and coming to a dinner of twenty people" (slightly awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from Adela's thoughts about her mother to observing Mrs. Churchley's actions feels slightly abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Adela's inner monologue and external actions without clear transitional phrases at times.
- [CLARITY] Adela's realization about her father and Mrs. Churchley could be more clearly signposted for the reader.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dinner scene to the brougham and then to the house could be smoother.
