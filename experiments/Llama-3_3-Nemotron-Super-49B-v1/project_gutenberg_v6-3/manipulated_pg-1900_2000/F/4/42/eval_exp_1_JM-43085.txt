Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst", "forthwith") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of the Introduction and the start of Early Years without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the art historical context (e.g., the significance of the romantic vs. classicist debate) without brief explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
