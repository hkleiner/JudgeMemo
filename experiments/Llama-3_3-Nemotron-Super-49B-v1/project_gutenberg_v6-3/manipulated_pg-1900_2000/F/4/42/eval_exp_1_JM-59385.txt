Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "have" instead of "had" in "Madame Yen have told her granddaughter" (tense inconsistency)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "luminous pearls", "draughts of their beauty")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel market scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long, potentially reducing clarity and focus
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between the main narrative and the reflective flashback

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
