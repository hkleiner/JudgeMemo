Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional effort for comprehension.
- [PUNCTUATION] Occasional lack of clarity in dialogue punctuation (e.g., missing quotation marks in some instances).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow and abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., from review preparation to the dinner scene).
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and relationships (e.g., Corvick and Gwendolen's situation) are introduced without sufficient context.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in focus (e.g., from the protagonist's review to Vereker's reaction at dinner) without clear connectors.
