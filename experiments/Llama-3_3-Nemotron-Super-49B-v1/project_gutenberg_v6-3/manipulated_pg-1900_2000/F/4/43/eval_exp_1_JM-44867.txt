Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "æsthetic", "mediæval") might reduce readability for modern audiences.
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs without clear section breaks.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing moral implications to the example of wars without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., "the spirit of compromise between the past and the future") could benefit from clearer examples.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression in some sections (e.g., jumping between types of minds and historical war examples).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
