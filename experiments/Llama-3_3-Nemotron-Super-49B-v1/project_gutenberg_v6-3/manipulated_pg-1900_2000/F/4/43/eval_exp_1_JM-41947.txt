- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but archaic spellings (e.g., "Quatorze") might confuse some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and Boucher's personal life (e.g., shift from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are too vague or require prior knowledge (e.g., "the shady... Jeanne little, Poisson")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between time jumps (e.g., from Boucher's youth to his manhood)
