Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "prepared you the to accept must and of be man But work his violinist," (incoherent sentence structure)
- [LEXICON] "world-defying skeptic" (uncommon phrase, may disrupt flow for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] "and the of invention I there at the the of player cease composer I and, skill but marvel" (disjointed sentence)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Diotti's sudden, intense emotional state after the concert feels somewhat unprepared (jump from triumph to despair)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical conversation in Chapter I to the concert scene in Chapter II (could benefit from a smoother link)
- [CLARITY] Mildred Wallace's character motivations and depth could be more clearly established in her interactions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
