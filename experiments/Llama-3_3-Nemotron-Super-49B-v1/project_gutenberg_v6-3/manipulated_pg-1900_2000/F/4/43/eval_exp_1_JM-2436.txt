Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "She the left with a of, hostess in, the qui, and of panic fear and queerness...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for all readers (e.g., "coruscating", "sauve")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor assumption leaps (e.g., Adela's certainty about her father's intentions without explicit confirmation)
- [TRANSITION] A few abrupt scene changes (e.g., from the house to the brougham without a clear transitional phrase)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
