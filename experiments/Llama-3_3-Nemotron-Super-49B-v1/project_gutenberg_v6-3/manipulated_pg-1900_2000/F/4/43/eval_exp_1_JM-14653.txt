Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "futilely", "ebullition") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs in Chapter Two could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from discussing Christmas spirit to critiquing 19th-century scientists slightly disrupts the narrative's logical progression.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
