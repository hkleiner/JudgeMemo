Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple instances of intentional misspelling to depict lisps (e.g., "ith", "thith", "lispeth"), which may distract some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "splay-tongued", "reptile-humanoids") that might slow reading for some.
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences with complex or awkward structures (e.g., "Ramsey fastened of walked weather head the-down hunched...") impacting flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shift from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the Earthgirl's thoughts) without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some character introductions and motivations (e.g., the Earthgirl's ability, Englander's situation) feel somewhat abrupt or underexplained.
- [LOGIC] The rapid progression of events and the ease with which planetarization is announced and accepted might feel unrealistic to some readers.
