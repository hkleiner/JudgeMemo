Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "And so it had gone from bad to worse until the town had ordered Bill Mason from the village of his adoption, and had bound Debby to Mrs. Lane for five years."
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "thou", "thee", "laid the rod across thy shoulders")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some dialogue transitions

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear temporal or narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Mrs. Lane's deep investment in Debby) could be more clearly established
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in focus from Debby's emotional state to historical events (Lexington, Bunker Hill) without smooth integration

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
