Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure in some paragraphs (e.g., abrupt shifts between dialogue and narrative)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial expressions (e.g., "By George") may affect readability for some readers
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but archaic language ("kayzarks", "stuns'ls") might confuse modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from space travel to arriving at a heavenly gate without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative occasionally disrupts the flow (e.g., "But Iâ€™ve wandered a little off the track of my tale")
- [CLARITY] Some comedic exchanges (e.g., the clerk's confusion over "America") slightly obscure the main narrative's progression

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
