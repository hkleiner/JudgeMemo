Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "Mikille", "Wirschiped") might require additional context for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "Romsey", "Rumsey") could cause minor confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative may disorient some readers without a clear timeline provided upfront.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural descriptions and historical events could benefit from clearer transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., "St. Brice's Day") might reduce clarity for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
