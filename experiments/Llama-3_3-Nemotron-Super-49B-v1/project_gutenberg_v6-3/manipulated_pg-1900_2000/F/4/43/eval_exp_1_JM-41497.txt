Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "dross", "mellower") might require additional cognitive effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (e.g., jumping between biography and art analysis) could slightly disrupt reader expectations.
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraph transitions feel abrupt (e.g., from discussing Italy's influence to Reynolds' personal life).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
