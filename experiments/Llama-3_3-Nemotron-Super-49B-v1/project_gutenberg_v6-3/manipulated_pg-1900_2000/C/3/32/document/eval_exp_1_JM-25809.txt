Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He could not call her mercenary. He knew better.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms might reduce readability for all audiences (e.g., "slumgullion", "durned")
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (letter inclusion) while effective, may momentarily disrupt pace for some readers
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting between Jim's emotional state and the arrival of Bud (could be smoother)
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency: Jim's depth of despair vs. his relatively quick engagement with Bud (contextually understandable but slightly jarring)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
