Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (repeated, unclear reference, likely should specify a location or object, e.g., "a city", "a dungeon")
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "inescapable", "millennialist", "inconceivable")
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., first sentence of "CHAPTER: BAHÁ’U’LLÁH")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and philosophical themes without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical and religious contexts (e.g., the Báb, Muḥammad) without brief explanation for unfamiliar readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between chapters (e.g., from "BAHÁ’U’LLÁH" to "BIRTH OF A NEW REVELATION")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
