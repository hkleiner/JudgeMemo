Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in several sentences (e.g., "the stuff" used without clear reference)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "altho", "the stuff")
- [SPELLING] "luxuriently" (likely should be "luxuriantly"), "a thing" (repeated, unclear)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles ("a", "the") in some places, affecting clarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between descriptive and historical sections
- [CLARITY] Overuse of unspecified terms ("the stuff") without immediate clarification
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge (e.g., botanical families without explanation)
