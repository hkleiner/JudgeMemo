Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "harrowing", "indefeasible") might require additional interpretation for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between chapters could be more clearly defined for smoother flow.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially overwhelming the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
