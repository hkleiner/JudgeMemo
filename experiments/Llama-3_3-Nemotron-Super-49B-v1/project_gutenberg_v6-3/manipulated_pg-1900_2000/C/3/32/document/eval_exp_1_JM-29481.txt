Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "On account of his wonderful ability as player, Diotti was a favorite at half the courts of Europe...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stuff", "thraldom", "chirography") might reduce readability for modern readers.
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent, but noticeable, lack of Oxford comma in some compound sentences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter II and III without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Diotti's emotional shift in Chapter II could be more subtly developed for smoother character progression.
- [TRANSITION] Some scene changes (e.g., from conservatory to drawing-room) feel slightly abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
