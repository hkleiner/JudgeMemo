Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "stuff" used ambiguously/inappropriately (e.g., "the stuff and Burns")
- [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "the thing much has already been written")
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (likely should be "Scotland" or another specific term, used repeatedly)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing food and discussing the puppy's future (end of "THE FINDING OF 'ROB ROY'")
- [CLARITY] Overly vague term "the thing" (repeatedly used without clear reference)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Uncle Alan's biography to Donald's adventures without clear connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
