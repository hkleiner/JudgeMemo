Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language (e.g., "a thing") and formal tone may slightly hinder modern readability.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from personal response to historical analysis without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the recipient's knowledge (e.g., historical context, "a thing") might confuse without additional context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
