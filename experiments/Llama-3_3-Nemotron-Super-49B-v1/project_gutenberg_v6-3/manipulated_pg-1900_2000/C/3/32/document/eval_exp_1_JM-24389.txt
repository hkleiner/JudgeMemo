Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thing", "frost-nipped", "slangy") might require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between present action and the protagonist's introspective thoughts without clear transitional markers at times.
- [CLARITY] A few character introductions and their relationships (e.g., Marche's connection to the club) could be more explicitly stated for immediate clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
