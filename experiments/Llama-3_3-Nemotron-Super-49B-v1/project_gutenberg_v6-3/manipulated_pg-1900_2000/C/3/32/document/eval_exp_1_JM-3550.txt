Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It is at these places that one meets crowds of Parisians...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "peregrinations", "salle à manger", "eau sucré") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SPELLING] No notable spelling errors detected.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative introduction (starts with location, then shifts to La Mère Bauche without clear initial connection).
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long, potentially reducing clarity and focus.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
