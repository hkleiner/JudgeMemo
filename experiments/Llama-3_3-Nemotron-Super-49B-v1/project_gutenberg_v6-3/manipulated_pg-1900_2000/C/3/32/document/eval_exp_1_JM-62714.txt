- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some outdated terms (e.g., "trolley ride") might require additional context for younger readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of Chapter I and the beginning of the unnamed section after (lack of clear chapter division or heading).
