Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sauve qui peut", "coruscating") might require additional effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow and introspective asides, while effective, may slightly disorient some readers.
- [CLARITY] Character motivations and relationships, especially Adela's concerns, are clear, but the pace of their development could be more balanced.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
