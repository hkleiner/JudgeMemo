Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but "stuff" without clear definition initially) might require additional context for full understanding.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive geography, cultural observations, and historical legends without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of regional geography and ethnic groups (e.g., Khirgis, Tangutans) without brief explanations may reduce clarity for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts from describing the expedition's journey to in-depth cultural analyses of the Sarö Yögurs.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
