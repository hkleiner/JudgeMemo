Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp representation, while consistent for Irwadians, may still cause reading flow issues for some readers)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "thith", "tho", "thertainly" for lisp effect (may become distracting)
- [SYNTAX] Some sentence structures are overly complex or long (e.g., the explanation of titanium's importance)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive scenes/dialogues (e.g., Ramsey's conversation with the Security Officer is largely repeated)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Ramsey's scene to the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection (disrupts narrative flow)
- [CLARITY] Background information (e.g., Ramsey's past, the significance of planetarization) could be more seamlessly integrated

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
