Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., first sentence of Chapter: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "a thing", "dandified", "morsel of humanity")
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of "a thing" appears to be a placeholder or error, disrupting fluency

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context and Boucher's personal life (e.g., shift from war news to family gathering)
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague references ("a thing", "a stuff") without clear explanation
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters (e.g., from THE SMALL BEGINNINGS to THE STUDENT)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
