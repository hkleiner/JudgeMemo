Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Archaic language usage (e.g., "warn’t", "ain’t") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "I judged I had some reputation in space, and I calculated to keep it.").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with a significant detour (comet race) before returning to the main storyline, potentially disrupting flow.
- [CLARITY] The transition from the comet race to arriving at the gates could be smoother, with clearer signaling of the narrative shift.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
