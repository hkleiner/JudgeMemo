Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "cuirassiers", "thrummed flight") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "INTRODUCTION" and "EARLY YEARS" chapters without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 19th-century French art movements and figures (e.g., David, Delacroix, Ingres) without brief contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
