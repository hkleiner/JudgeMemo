1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a stuff") and phrasing ("the thing") could confuse modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (e.g., jumping between biography and art analysis) might disorient some readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 18th-century art and figures (e.g., Liotard, Romney) without introduction.
