Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst" not present but "lend light" could be clarified) might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel market scene to Kuei Pingâ€™s memory of the mission school (could be smoother).
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative might confuse readers not expecting the flashback.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
