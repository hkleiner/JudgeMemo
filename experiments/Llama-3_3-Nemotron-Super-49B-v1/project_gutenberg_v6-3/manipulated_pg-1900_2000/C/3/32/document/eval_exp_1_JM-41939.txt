Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, likely should be "stuff" -> "studio" or another appropriate word)
- [SYNTAX] "in the thing" (repeated, unclear reference, should specify location)
- [LEXICON] "irksome task" (somewhat archaic, may reduce readability for some)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear timeline (could benefit from clearer chronological markers)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt location changes (e.g., from Bordeaux to Paris, lacks transitional smoothing)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
