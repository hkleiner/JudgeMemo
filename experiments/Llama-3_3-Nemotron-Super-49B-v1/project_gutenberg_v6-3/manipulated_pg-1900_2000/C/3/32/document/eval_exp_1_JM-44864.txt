Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "the stuff") and lack of clear definitions might confuse modern readers.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but inconsistent naming ("the thing") is distracting.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between historical anecdotes.
- [CLARITY] Overuse of unspecified references (e.g., "the thing", "a stuff") reduces clarity.
