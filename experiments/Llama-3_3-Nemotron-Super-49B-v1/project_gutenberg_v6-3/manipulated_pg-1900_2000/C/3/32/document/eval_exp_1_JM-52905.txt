Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (likely should be "stuff" is unclear, possibly "bush" or another term for a hiding spot, but not a clear error, removed)
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are simple and lack variation in structure.
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of basic vocabulary (e.g., "said", "answered").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling with unclear transitions between chapters.
- [LOGIC] Some plot points feel convenient (e.g., Mr. Merry Sun's intervention).
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Danny Fox's consistent evilness) are clear but somewhat one-dimensional.
