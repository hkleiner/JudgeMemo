Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "quasi-biological", "superorganic") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between Spencer's biography, philosophical concepts, and the narrator's reflections could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes a high baseline knowledge of Spencer, his works, and 19th-century intellectual context, potentially alienating less informed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
