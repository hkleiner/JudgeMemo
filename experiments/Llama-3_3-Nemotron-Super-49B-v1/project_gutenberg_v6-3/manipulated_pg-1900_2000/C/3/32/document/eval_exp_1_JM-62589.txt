Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "There was one other thing Debby hungered for, that was her drum")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "stuff" to refer to Debby, "thou")
- [GRAMMAR] Infrequent but noticeable inconsistencies in verb tense

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear temporal or thematic bridge
- [CLARITY] Some scenes or character motivations could be more explicitly stated for clarity (e.g., Debby's immediate hatred for the King)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs within chapters

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
