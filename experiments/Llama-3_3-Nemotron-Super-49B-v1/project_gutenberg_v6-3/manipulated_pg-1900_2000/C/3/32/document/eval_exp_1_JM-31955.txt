Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., first paragraph of Chapter: INTRODUCTION)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "stuff", "Cataract", "Squaw")
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of "stuff" instead of "falls" or "waterfall" is confusing

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about Native American beliefs without clear evidence (e.g., linking the Legend of Healing to the Christian "Bow of Promise")
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical facts and legend discussions (e.g., between Chapter: INTRODUCTION and CHAPTER: CIRCULAR RAINBOWS)
- [CLARITY] Overly speculative statements (e.g., "It is probably to the latter class--modern traditions...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
