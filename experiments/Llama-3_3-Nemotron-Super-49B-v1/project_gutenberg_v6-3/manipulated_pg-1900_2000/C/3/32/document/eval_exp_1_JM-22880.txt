Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a thing", "the stuff") and lack of definition may confuse modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of archaic names and spellings (e.g., "Rumesige", "Romsey") which, while historically accurate, may cause initial confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative may disorient some readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed historical context (e.g., events, figures) without brief explanations for potentially uninformed readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural descriptions and historical events without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
