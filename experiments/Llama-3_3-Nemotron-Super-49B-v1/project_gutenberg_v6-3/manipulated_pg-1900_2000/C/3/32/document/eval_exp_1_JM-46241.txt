Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Unhappily, even at the time of their first woodcut book, the beginning of the end was on them; about thirty years afterwards...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for non-specialists (e.g., "medi√¶val", "rubrishers", "foliations")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear discussion of topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing specific books to general qualities of the art) 
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of the subject (e.g., references to "the stuff" without clear explanation until later)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
