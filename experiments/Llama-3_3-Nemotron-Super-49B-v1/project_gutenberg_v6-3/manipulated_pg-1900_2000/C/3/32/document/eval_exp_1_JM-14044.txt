Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "a stuff", "Ã¦terno convivio", "sonus epulantium") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression with frequent shifts between past events, the story's conception, and its aftermath, potentially disorienting some readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with the historical context ("the retreat from Mons") and literary references could reduce clarity for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
