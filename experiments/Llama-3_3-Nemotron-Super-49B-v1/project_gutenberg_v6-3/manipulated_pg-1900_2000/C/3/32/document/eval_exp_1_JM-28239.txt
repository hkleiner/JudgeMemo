Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "being but a few feet above the sea, and cypress swamps are not infrequent").
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering immediate understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical events without clear chronological connectors.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about historical figures' thoughts/feelings without clear evidence (e.g., the priest's meditation experience).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters, disrupting the narrative flow.
