Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (repeated, unclear reference, likely a placeholder or error)
- [SYNTAX] "the thing" (inconsistent, unclear object/reference, e.g., "the thing in 1528", "a boyhood friend, a stuff Zelotti")
- [LEXICON] "stuff" (inappropriately used, unclear meaning, e.g., "entrusted him to a stuff", "a stuff Zelotti")
- [GRAMMAR] "the cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga decided to decorate the cathedral at Mantua, recently rebuilt by Giulio Romano. He sent a summons to Caliari, as well as to three other Veronese painters..." (could benefit from clearer transition for better flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear summary/conclusion for the previous (e.g., from "INTRODUCTION" to "THE FIRST YEARS")
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge (e.g., specifics about Venetian school, historical figures without introduction)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between paragraphs in some instances (e.g., jumping from Veronese's early life to his work in Venice without a connecting sentence)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
