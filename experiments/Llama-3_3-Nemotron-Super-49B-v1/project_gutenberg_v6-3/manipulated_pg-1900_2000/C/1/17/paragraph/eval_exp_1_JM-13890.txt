Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from historical event to artist's biography without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "tesselated pavements", "sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and present in different chapters)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of Bahá’u’lláh’s life (Chapter II, last paragraph) disrupts historical narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between Chapter I and II, and within sections (e.g., artist biographies vs. Canterbury history)
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences between vastly different topics (e.g., from 16th-century religious edicts to 18th-century art influences)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
