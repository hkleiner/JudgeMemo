Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in several places (e.g., "The astonishing progress...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "in vulgar language", "a going concern")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing progress to Kentucky's geography without clear connection

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected mention of "The claim" and "Muslim clergy" in Chapter: Beginnings of Settlements
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., LaSalle's expedition followed by events over a century later without clear transitional device)
- [CLARITY] Overly vague phrase "and otherwise he filled his scanty purse" (Chapter: Beginnings of Settlements)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
