Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "coöperation", "sower") might require reader effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing coöperation and the historical context of the Báb (seems out of place).
- [CLARITY] Overly broad topics covered without clear connections between all sections (e.g., shift from coöperation types to pre-Industrial Revolution society).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
