Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst" implied in context, though not directly used) and literary references might challenge less knowledgeable readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the anecdote about the Colonial squatter and the discussion on Dr. Johnson.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical and literary figures without introduction may confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
