Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between chapters (e.g., Chapter I to II, and the sudden historical inserts)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "lucubrations", "felicity")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequitur historical passages disrupt narrative flow (e.g., Teheran, Louis Quatorze)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., from Corvick's departure to the walk)
- [LOGIC] Character motivations and reactions could be more clearly established (e.g., Lady Jane's drops in enthusiasm)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
