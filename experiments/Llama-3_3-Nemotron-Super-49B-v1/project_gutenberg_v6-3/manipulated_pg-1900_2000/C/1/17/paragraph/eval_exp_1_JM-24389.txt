Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Marche's thoughts to Bahá’u’lláh’s mission without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "duskier and vaguer", "subterranean dungeon") may hinder smooth reading for general audience
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., past simple and past perfect used closely together without clear narrative reason)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission disrupts narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential information presentation (e.g., character backstories and philosophical asides interrupt main plot progression)
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and relationships could be more clearly established early on (e.g., Marche's true intentions, Herold family dynamics)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
