Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thirties and forties" without clear century context, "gamin") might confuse modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical context, literary analysis, and story introduction (e.g., from Dickens' health to "The Story" chapter).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from _Edwin Drood_ analysis to unrelated historical figures like Reynolds).
- [CLARITY] Overly assumed knowledge of Dickens' works and historical context without introduction.
- [LOGIC] Unexplained connections (e.g., the relevance of Bahá’u’lláh’s experience to the rest of the text).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
