Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It is at these places that one meets crowds of Parisians...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "peregrinations", "imposed on").
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift in topic (e.g., from hotel description to historical context without clear connection).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur introduction of Reynolds and art history.
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative jumps (e.g., from Vernet's description to La MÃ¨re Bauche's character, then to unrelated historical events).
- [CLARITY] Overly vague transitions between ideas (e.g., "And thus she walked her path...").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
