Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Well might heads be shaken solemnly...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "wheresoever", "thou")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Millet to Dr. Johnson and Reynolds without clear connection

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur introduction of Dr. Johnson and Reynolds disrupts focus on Millet
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between some paragraphs (e.g., transition from Millet's style to 18th-century English aristocracy)
- [CLARITY] Overly broad statements without direct relevance to Millet (e.g., discussion of translation programs for Bahá’u’lláh’s writings)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
