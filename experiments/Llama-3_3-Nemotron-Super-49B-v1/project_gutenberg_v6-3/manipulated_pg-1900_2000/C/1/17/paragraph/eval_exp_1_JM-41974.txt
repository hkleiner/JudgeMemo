Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Veronese to George III and then to Reynolds without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "salutary exigencies", "musselman feluccas")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "was" and "is" in different paragraphs)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and disjointed narrative flow (e.g., jumping between Veronese's life, historical events, and artistic analysis)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between unrelated topics (e.g., from Veronese's biography to the early 19th century)
- [LOGIC] Irrelevant paragraphs (e.g., the section on the early 19th century and messianic expectations) disrupt the focus on Veronese

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
