Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "palsied", "demure") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the emotional family reunion to philosophical and historical tangents (e.g., the passage about Bahá’u’lláh, the commentary on generations and movements) disrupts narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs shift abruptly in focus (e.g., from Leonard's homecoming to broader societal reflections), potentially confusing the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
