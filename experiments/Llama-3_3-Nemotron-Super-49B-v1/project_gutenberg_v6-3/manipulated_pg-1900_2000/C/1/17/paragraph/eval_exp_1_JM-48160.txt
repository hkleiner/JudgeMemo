2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential and disjointed narrative flow (e.g., unrelated historical and philosophical inserts)
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear thematic connection between some paragraphs (e.g., the sudden introduction of Boucher and Von Eicken)
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through topic shifts
