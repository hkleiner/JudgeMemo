Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense shifts (e.g., "had impressed" to "may be noted")

- [LEXICON] Archaic terms ("double-florins") without context for modern readers
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., the paragraph starting with "With great relish...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt, unconnected narrative jumps (e.g., from Ramsey's conversation to historical/political tangents)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential storytelling (e.g., the sudden introduction of Boucher and Lemoyne's studio)
- [CLARITY] Unclear character motivations (e.g., the Earthgirl's actions and thoughts)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between scenes (e.g., from the spacefield to Englander's flat)
