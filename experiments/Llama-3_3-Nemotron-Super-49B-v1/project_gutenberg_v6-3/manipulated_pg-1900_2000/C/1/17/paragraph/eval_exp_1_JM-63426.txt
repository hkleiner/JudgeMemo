Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pauperising", "gaiety") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Bradley's impact to a detailed, unrelated historical socioeconomic context (mid-text) without clear connection.

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter, jumping between biography, philosophical musings, and detailed anecdotes without clear transitions.
   - [LOGIC] The inclusion of the Muslim clergy's claim seems entirely unrelated to the rest of the text, disrupting coherence.
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed, specific anecdotes (e.g., the entirety of "The Boy Printer" chapter) may overwhelm the central theme of introducing Will Bradley's work and impact.

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
