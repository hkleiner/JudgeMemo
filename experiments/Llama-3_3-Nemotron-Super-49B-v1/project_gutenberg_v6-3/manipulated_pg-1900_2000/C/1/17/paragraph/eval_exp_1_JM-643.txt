Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between chapters (e.g., Chapter I to II, II to III) without clear thematic connection.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "unregenerate", "sequestered", "prohibitory sentiment") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., Chapter II shifts between past and present).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with unclear connections between chapters (e.g., Chapter III seems unrelated to the story's core).
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shifts in subject matter (e.g., from Neil Paraday to economic history in Chapter III).
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures obscure meaning in several instances.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
