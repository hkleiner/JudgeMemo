Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "He had come into the world a naked, starving human soul; he longed to clothe himself, and he was hungry and ever hungrier for knowledge;")
   - [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "congress" shoe, "jew’s-harp")
   - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative need)

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different narrative threads (e.g., from Anthony Croft's story to the passage about Bahá’u’lláh without clear connection)
   - [LOGIC] Lack of explicit connections between some paragraphs, potentially confusing the narrative flow
   - [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages may obscure the main narrative points for some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
