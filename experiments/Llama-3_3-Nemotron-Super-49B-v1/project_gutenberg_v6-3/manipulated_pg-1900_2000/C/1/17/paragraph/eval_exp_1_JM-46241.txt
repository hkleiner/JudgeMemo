Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "mediæval", "thou") might require additional effort for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spelling conventions (e.g., "Augstburg" implied, though not directly present, in context of "Augsburg" repetitions) could slightly distract.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing woodcut books and the Báb's execution (paragraph starting "Their denunciation...").
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the main topic and the paragraph about Leicester Square and Reynolds.
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of philosophical ideas (Von Eicken, Sybel, Tocqueville) at the end.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
