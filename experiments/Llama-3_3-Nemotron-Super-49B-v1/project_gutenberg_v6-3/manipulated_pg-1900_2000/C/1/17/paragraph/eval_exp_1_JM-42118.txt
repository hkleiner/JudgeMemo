Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "As the glovemaker looked out...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "bewigged", "fopperies")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and Fragonard's biography (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh’s writings section seems out of place)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters ("CHAPTER: ROME" feels disconnected)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
