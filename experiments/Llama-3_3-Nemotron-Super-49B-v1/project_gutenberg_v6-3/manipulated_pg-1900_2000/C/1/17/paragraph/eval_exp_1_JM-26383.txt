Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Anna Seward's biography to François Boucher and then to historical/political philosophy without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "thou", "whilst" not present but overall tone)
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur introduction of François Boucher and historical/political theorists (Von Eicken, Sybel, Tocqueville) without clear relevance to Anna Seward or Lichfield
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between different topics (e.g., from Anna Seward's family to the description of the Cathedral and back)
- [STRUCTURE] Biographical focus frequently interrupted by tangential historical or architectural descriptions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
