Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", implied by Shakespearean quote context, though not directly used) and less common terms (e.g., "pauperising") might require additional effort for comprehension.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Bahá’u’lláh to Woman Suffrage without clear connective tissue.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between historical contexts (e.g., from 18th-century France to the role of Socialism in Women’s Rights) without a clear thematic bridge.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative and lack of a clear central argument until the latter part.
- [CLARITY] Overly broad historical references without direct relevance to the main argument may confuse readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
