Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It is far more interesting to see great men as they lived." feels disconnected from its preceding sentence)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "tipstaff", "livres", "double-florins")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical context and Boucher's biography (e.g., the transition from discussing 18th-century London to Boucher's family)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., from Boucher's early life to historical events without clear chronological flow)
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed historical context sometimes overshadows the main subject (Boucher's life and development as an artist)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., Louis Quatorze, Watteau) without introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
