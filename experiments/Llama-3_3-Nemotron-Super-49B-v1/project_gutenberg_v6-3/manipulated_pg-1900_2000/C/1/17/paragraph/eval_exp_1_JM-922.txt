Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure changes (e.g., shift from descriptive to biographical without clear transition)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "slovenly", "besotted")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in some lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from London Sundays to Bahá’u’lláh to 18th-century England without clear connections)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between vastly different topics (e.g., from social commentary to artistic biography)
- [LOGIC] Unconnected historical and philosophical references (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh's introduction seems unrelated to the initial theme)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
