Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "lumbering and trammelled flight") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Meissonier's biography to discussing Joshua Reynolds without clear contextual link.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between the end of the Introduction and the start of the Early Years chapter.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
