Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical context (French Revolution) and narrative (e.g., "The necessary changes would have come about earlier...").
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may impede smooth reading for modern audiences (e.g., "whilst", "thou", not present but potential for similar issues).
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Bahá’u’lláh, Myers and Podmore, Reynolds without clear connection to the main story).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Unexplained, abrupt transitions between unrelated topics (Bahá’u’lláh, art discussions).
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chapter thematic consistency (Chapter II starts with unrelated "youth vowed" narrative).
- [CLARITY] Overly complex, dense historical/contextual information without clear relevance to the plot.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
