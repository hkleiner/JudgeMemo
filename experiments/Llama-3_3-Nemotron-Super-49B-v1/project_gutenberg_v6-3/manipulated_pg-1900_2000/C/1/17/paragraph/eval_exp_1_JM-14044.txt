Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., the transition between discussing art and the Victorian Age)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dross", "æterno convivio") that may hinder smooth reading for some readers
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing "The Bowmen" to a detailed, unrelated anecdote about Watteau and Boucher

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings, disrupting the narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling and tangents (e.g., the story about Watteau) that distract from the central theme of "The Bowmen"
- [CLARITY] Overly speculative and meandering explanation of how "The Bowmen" evolved into "The Angels of Mons"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
