Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in transitions between topics (e.g., shift from old lady's story to Boucher's biography)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "hapless", "garrulous", "thou")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles or inconsistent verb tense (e.g., "Ninety! Very good, granny: you were born, then, in 1772.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with unrelated segments (e.g., insertion of Boucher's story)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between different story elements (e.g., from Queen Charlotte to Bahá’u’lláh)
- [LOGIC] Unresolved juxtaposition of vastly different historical and personal narratives
