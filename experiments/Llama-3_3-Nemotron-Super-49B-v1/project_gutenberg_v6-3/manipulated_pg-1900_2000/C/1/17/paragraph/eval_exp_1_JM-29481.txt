Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The phenomenon is one that has no reference points in the contemporary world, but is associated rather with climactic changes of direction in the collective past of the human race.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thraldom", "unendorsed greatness", "concord") might reduce readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Diotti and Miss Wallace to a detailed description of Bahá’u’lláh (end of Chapter I) disrupts narrative flow.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from the concert scene (Chapter II) to a historical reflection on England in the eighteenth century (beginning of Chapter III) without clear connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
