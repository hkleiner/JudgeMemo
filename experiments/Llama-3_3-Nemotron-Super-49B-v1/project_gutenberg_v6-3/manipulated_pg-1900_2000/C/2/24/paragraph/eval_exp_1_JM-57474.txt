Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some paragraphs.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" in quoted text, though contextually appropriate) might slightly hinder modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical examples and the main argument (e.g., the shift after "The scanning module aligned with the grid.").
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with multiple layered ideas reduce immediate clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
