Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "peregrinations", "salle à manger", "eau sucré") might challenge modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative introduction (e.g., abrupt shift from landscape to La Mère Bauche) slightly disrupts initial coherence.
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Madame Bauche's sudden realization of Marie's attractiveness) could be more explicitly developed for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
