Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe") might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel market scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition).
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure, while effective, may momentarily disorient some readers unfamiliar with such storytelling.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
