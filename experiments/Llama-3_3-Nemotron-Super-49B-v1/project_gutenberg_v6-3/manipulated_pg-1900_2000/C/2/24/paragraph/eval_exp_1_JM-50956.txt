Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures (e.g., "The nightmare of Bolshevism was able to overtake Russia because she was exhausted...") 
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or formal vocabulary may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "sanguine World struggle", "auto-tuner")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all historical events and figures without introduction (e.g., Moltke's plan, General Ludendorf's memoirs) 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Russia's role to criticizing Ludendorf's memoirs without a clear connecting transition 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
