Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have never had a very favorable opinion of those two towns since, and while I hope there is more loyalty and patriotism now than then, I feel that their forefathers put a blot on their little cities that will never be erased.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "rendezvous", "Yanks", "Johnnies") may slightly impede modern readers' flow
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent but noticeable lack of commas for clarity in long sentences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abruptly moving from a social event to a battle description without clear transitional phrases)
- [CLARITY] A few instances where the transition between personal anecdotes and broader military context feels abrupt or unclear
- [TRANSITION] Limited use of transitional phrases to connect distinct events or sections

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
