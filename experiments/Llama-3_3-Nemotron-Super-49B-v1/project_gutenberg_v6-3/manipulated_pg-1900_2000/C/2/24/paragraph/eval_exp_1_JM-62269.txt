Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Infrequent use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "bivouac", "barbaric", "venerable") might slow reading for non-advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive scenes and explanatory passages without clear transitional phrases at times.
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs assume prior knowledge of Gypsy cultures or terms (e.g., "Sinte", "Roma") without brief contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
