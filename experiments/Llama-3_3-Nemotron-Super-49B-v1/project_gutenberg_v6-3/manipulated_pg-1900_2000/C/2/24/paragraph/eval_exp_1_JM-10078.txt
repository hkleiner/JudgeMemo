Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic language (e.g., "duly received", "laboured in the employ") might reduce readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing press freedom to introducing "The charging station blinked green" without clear connection.
   - [STRUCTURE] The inclusion of "A camera lens refocused itself" and "The virtual pet blinked twice" seems unrelated to the letter's context, disrupting coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
