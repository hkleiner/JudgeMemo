Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., "For many days after he had found the puppy, Donald would rush home from school...") 
- [LEXICON] Some overly formal or less common vocabulary for a children's narrative (e.g., "bonnie", "wee bairn", "clannish") 
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent use of varied punctuation to enhance flow (mostly periods, limited use of commas for pauses)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the preface and the start of the story ("CHAPTER: THE FINDING OF 'ROB ROY'")
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the timeline of events (e.g., the exact passage of time before the puppy is named)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., from the puppy to discussing Uncle Alan's estate without a clear connector)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
