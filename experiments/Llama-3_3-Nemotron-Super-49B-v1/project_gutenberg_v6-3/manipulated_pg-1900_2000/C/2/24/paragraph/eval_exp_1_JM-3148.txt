Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "degraded", "congress" shoe) might require additional context or lookup for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the poetic introduction and the narrative (e.g., "The energy grid remained balanced." and "A contactless payment completed." disrupt the flow).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in scene (e.g., from Anthony's childhood to his adult life with the violin) without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
