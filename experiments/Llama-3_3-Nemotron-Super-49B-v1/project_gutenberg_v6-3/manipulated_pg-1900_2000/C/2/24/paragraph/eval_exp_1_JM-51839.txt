Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Thus it is recounted that in the days of long ago...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "spilled wine and scattered musk") might require additional context for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical periods/chapters without clear chronological markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of some historical figures/events (e.g., Philip Nolanâ€™s expedition, Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda) without brief introductions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
