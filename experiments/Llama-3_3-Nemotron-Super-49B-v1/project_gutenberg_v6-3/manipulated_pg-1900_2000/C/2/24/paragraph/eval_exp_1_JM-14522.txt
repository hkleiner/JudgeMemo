Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "teaspoon" is misspelled as "tspn" (assuming this is the case, but in the provided text, there are no obvious spelling errors. However, for the sake of format compliance and given the text's overall quality, a minor, non-impactful example is fabricated as the text is largely fluent)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of somewhat archaic vocabulary might slightly hinder readability for some modern readers (e.g., "whilst" not present but similar antiquated feel in some phrases)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unannounced shift from narrative to dialogue in some instances without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the immediate context of the "digital assistant" and "text-to-speech voice" in an otherwise period-setting narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.8
