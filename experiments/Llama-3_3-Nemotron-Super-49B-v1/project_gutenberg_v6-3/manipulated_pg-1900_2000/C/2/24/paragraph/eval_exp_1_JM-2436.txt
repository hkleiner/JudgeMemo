Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "sauve qui peut", "brougham") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow in some sections (e.g., abrupt shift from dinner scene to Adela's reflections).
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (especially Adela's immediate certainty about her father's intentions) could be more explicitly developed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
