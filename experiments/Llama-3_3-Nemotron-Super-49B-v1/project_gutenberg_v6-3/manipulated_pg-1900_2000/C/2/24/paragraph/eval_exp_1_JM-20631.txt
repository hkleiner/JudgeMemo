Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in transitions between historical and philosophical discussions
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") in quoted prayers/texts may hinder modern readability
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent but noticeable lack of clarity in long, complex sentences due to punctuation

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Some arguments against critics of Judaism's "Chosen People" concept feel slightly defensive without fully addressing the critique
- [TRANSITION] Chapters I and II could benefit from clearer transitional phrases to connect the critique of Judaism with its historical and modern defense
- [CLARITY] A few paragraphs in Chapter II assume prior knowledge of specific historical or religious contexts without brief explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
