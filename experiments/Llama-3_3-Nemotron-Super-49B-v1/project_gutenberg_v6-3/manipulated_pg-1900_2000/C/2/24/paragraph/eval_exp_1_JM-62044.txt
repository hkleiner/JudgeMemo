- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", implied by "who loveth") and overly formal tone
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but "Sciurus" species naming could be clarified for general readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between personal anecdotes and broader philosophical discussions
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge about the author's previous work ("my history of two pet squirrels") without clear context for new readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unconnected sentence ("A drone swarm aligned in formation.") and ("A scanner swept the room once.")
