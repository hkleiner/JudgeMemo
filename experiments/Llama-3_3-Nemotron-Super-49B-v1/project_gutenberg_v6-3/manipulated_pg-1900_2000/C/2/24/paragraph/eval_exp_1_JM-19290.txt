Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Sudden, unrelated phrases ("A keyboard clicked without being touched.", "A hologram displayed the weather.", "A bluetooth signal was detected.") disrupt flow.
   - [LEXICON] Some sentences are overly complex, potentially hindering readability for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical context, philosophical themes, and biographical narrative without clear connectors.
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological storytelling in places (e.g., jumping back to early life after detailed later events) may confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
