Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "doth") and references may require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between past recollections, present observations, and fictionalized dialogue (e.g., the royal ghost).
- [CLARITY] Assumed historical knowledge (e.g., specific battles, historical figures) without explanation may confuse uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
