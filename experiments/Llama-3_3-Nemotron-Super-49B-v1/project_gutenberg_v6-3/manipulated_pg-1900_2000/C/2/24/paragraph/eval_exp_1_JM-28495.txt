Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional cognitive effort for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression in Chapter I, with a abrupt shift to Chapter II without clear resolution of the prior scenario.
- [CLARITY] The chase sequence, while engaging, slightly overshadows the primary goal (finding the dog home), causing brief narrative focus dispersion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
