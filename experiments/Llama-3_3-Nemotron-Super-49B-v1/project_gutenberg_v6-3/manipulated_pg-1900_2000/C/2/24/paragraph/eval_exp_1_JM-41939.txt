Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "irksome task", "relinquish", "penurious") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between some paragraphs (e.g., from Rosa's childhood to the "hologram" and "smart bulb" anachronisms without clear connection or explanation).
- [CLARITY] Anachronistic elements ("hologram flickered to life", "A smart bulb changed color", "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch") disrupt the historical narrative's coherence and timeline.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
