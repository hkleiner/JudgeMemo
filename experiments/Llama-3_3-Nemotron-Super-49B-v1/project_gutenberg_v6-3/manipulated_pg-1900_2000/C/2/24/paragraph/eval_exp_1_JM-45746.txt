Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I must not accept just a mere job, and to escape that humiliation I became a teacher.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "hopelessly about" could be more idiomatic)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing articles in a few places, though not prevalent)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the story of the two young men and the shift to "Getting a Position" chapter
