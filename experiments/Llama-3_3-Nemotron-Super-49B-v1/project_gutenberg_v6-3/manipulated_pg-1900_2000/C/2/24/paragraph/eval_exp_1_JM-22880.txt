Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "mikille", "thou", "thee") might require additional effort for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Variations in name spellings (e.g., "Romsey", "Rumsey") could cause minor confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear historical narrative might disorient some readers without a clear timeline.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural descriptions and historical events could improve with clearer linking.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of historical figures and architectural styles may hinder understanding for uninformed readers.
