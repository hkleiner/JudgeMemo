Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in some transitions (e.g., "The home assistant played ambient music.")
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist audiences
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unannounced shift in topic (e.g., introduction of "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with "the ancient tale of Majn√∫n" without brief context
- [STRUCTURE] Chapters seem loosely connected without a clear overarching narrative thread
- [CLARITY] Overly broad, general statements (e.g., "historical forces that steadily gather momentum") without specific examples

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
