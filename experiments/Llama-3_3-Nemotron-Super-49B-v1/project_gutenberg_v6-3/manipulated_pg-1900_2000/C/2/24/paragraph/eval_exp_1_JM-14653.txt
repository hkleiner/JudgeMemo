Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "futile noises", "venomous thought", "unlovely gesture", "candidly greedy") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between Chapter One and Chapter Two could be smoother, with a more explicit link between the personal reflection and the broader philosophical discussion.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt introduction of technological elements (e.g., "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch", "A thermal sensor picked up movement", "A retinal implant synced quietly") disrupts the otherwise consistent nostalgic and philosophical tone.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
