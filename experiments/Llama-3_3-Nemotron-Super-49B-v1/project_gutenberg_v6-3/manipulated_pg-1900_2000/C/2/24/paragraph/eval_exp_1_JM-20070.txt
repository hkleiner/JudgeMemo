Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "palsied", "gypsy pedler") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the emotional reunion to philosophical reflections on war without a clear transitional link.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs blend multiple timelines (past, present, future plans) without explicit markers, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
