Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "auto-tuner" and "phone" anachronisms in 18th-century context
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., first paragraph)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly modern for the historical setting (e.g., "agom with stirring affairs" could be more idiomatic as "abuzz")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context and Boucher's life (e.g., "A contactless payment completed." and "A phone rang...")
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguities in timeline transitions (e.g., between "THE SMALL BEGINNINGS" and "THE STUDENT" chapters)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unexplained shifts in scene (e.g., introduction of "PÃ¨re Cars" without clear connection)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
