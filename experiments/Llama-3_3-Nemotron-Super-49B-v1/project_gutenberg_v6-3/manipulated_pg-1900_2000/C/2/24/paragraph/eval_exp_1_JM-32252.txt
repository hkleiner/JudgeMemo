Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or highly specialized vocabulary (e.g., "negociatores", "Stadtwirtschaft") might challenge less knowledgeable readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing medieval capitalism to introducing "The nanobots completed their diagnostics" and "A drone hovered silently above" without clear connection or explanation.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge in economic history, potentially alienating some readers without providing sufficient context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
