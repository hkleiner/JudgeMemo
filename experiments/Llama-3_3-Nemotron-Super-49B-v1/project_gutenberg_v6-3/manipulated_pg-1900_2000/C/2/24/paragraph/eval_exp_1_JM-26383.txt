Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
   - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "cadaverum campus", "plenitude of face") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biographical details and historical/contextual information.
   - [CLARITY] The inclusion of unrelated, modern elements (e.g., "A fingerprint scanner glowed green", "A 3D printer started humming", "A storage cloud expanded its archive") disrupts the historical narrative's coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
