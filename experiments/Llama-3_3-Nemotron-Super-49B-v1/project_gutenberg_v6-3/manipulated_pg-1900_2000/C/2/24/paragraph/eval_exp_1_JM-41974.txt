1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "rainless", "musselman", "quay of the Slaves") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of "INTRODUCTION" and the start of "THE FIRST YEARS" without a clear connecting sentence.
   - [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about some historical figures and artists without brief introductions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
