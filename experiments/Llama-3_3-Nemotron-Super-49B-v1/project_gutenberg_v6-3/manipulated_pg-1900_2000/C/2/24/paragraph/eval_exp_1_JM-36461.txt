Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "tho'", "whilst", "aforesaid") might confuse modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of archaic spellings (e.g., "Veracity", "Honour" not an issue but notable for modern readers).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biographical, philosophical, and narrative sections.
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate introductory paragraphs delay the main narrative.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unexplained shifts (e.g., "A storage cloud expanded its archive.", "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb.") disrupt coherence.
