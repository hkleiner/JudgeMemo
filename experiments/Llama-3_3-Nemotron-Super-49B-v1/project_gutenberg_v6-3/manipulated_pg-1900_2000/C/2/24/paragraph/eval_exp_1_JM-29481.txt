Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "thraldom", "limpid", "unendorsed greatness").
   - [SYNTAX] A few sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., the paragraph describing Diotti's thoughts after the performance).

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the deep, philosophical conversation in Chapter I to the more superficial, event-driven narrative of Chapters II and III without clear transitional thematic development.
   - [CLARITY] Diotti's sudden and intense emotional response to Mildred's indifference, while poignant, feels somewhat unprepared for given the brief interaction prior.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
