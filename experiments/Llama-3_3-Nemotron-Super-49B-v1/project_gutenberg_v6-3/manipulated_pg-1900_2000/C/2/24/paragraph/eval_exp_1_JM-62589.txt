Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in several places (e.g., "It mattered little to Debby whether her father was Whig or Tory, no matter what he was she hungered for him day and night.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly anachronistic or overly formal for the narrative voice (e.g., "thou", "thee" in dialogue feels inconsistent with the rest of the text's language)
- [ANACHRONISM] Modern elements (e.g., "the LED ceiling glowed with ambient light", "A delivery robot rolled to a halt") disrupt historical setting

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear temporal or thematic bridge
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Mrs. Lane's deep investment in Debby) could be more clearly established
- [LOGIC] Debby's ability to think about historical events (e.g., Lexington, Bunker Hill) with specific knowledge seems premature for her character development and the narrative's timeline

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
