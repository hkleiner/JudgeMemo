Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in transitions (e.g., "Howeverâ€”to return to the war zone.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly formal or less common vocabulary (e.g., "inverted snob", "territorial significance")
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but potential for minor typos (e.g., "taubes" - assuming "taube" is correct in context, otherwise [SPELLING] error)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., introduction of unrelated elements like "The home assistant played ambient music" and "A storage cloud expanded its archive")
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences or conclusions, causing slight confusion
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs, disrupting the flow
