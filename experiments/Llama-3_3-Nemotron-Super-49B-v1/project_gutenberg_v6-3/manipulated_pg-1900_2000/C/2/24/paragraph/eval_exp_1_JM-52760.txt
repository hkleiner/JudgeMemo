Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in some paragraphs (e.g., abrupt transition in "A drone dropped a package nearby.")
- [LEXICON] Overly technical vocabulary may hinder readability for non-experts (e.g., "plank roads" without immediate context)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent spacing around em dashes (e.g., "â€”" without spaces)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained appearances of modern elements (e.g., "A drone dropped a package nearby", "The surveillance drone made no sound", "A signal booster amplified the stream") disrupt historical context
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from strategic overview to detailed descriptions of Petersburg without clear linking sentences
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of the Civil War's broader context without sufficient background for unfamiliar readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
