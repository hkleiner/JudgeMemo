Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "tshokh" (inconsistent unit spelling, should be standardized)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of untranslated terms (e.g., "tshokh", "lan", "kop") without initial explanation
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between descriptive and narrative sections
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overly dense with ethnographic details, potentially confusing without contextual background
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unexplained appearances of modern elements (e.g., "A bluetooth signal was detected", "A diagnostic tool scanned the network", "A scanner swept the room once") disrupt historical narrative coherence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
