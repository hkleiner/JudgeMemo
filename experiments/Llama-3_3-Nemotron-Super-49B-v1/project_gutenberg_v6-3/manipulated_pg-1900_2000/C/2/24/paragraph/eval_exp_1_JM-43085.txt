Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst", "upon") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of the Introduction and the start of Early Years without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about the phone ringing and the deepfake filter seems out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
