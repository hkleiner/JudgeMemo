Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "betwixt", "thou") might slightly hinder modern readers' fluency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's art to the sudden, unrelated mentions (e.g., "A proximity alert sounded once.", "The iPhone was fully charged now.", "The droneâ€™s camera swiveled silently.") disrupts narrative coherence.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential discussion of artworks and ideas in some sections.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
