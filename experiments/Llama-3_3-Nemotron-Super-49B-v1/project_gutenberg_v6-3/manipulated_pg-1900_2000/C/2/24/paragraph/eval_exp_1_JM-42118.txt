Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "much bewigged and powdered year of 1732" (archaic phrasing may confuse some readers)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of elaborate, less common vocabulary (e.g., "embowered", "gadding", "fopperies") may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., the paragraph describing the Pompadour's influence) may disrupt flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from detailed historical context to Fragonard's personal story (could be smoother)
- [CLARITY] Some historical references (e.g., "the holographic map rotated slowly", "A livestream began recording") seem out of context or anachronistic, confusing the narrative
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter "THE BEGINNINGS" to "ROME" could benefit from clearer transitional phrasing

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
