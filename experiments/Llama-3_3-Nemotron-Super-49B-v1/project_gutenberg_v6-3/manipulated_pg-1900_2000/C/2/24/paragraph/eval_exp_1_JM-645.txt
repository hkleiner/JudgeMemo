Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow and abrupt transitions between thoughts (e.g., sudden shifts from personal reflection to dialogue) can disrupt continuity.
- [CLARITY] Character motivations and some plot points (e.g., the significance of Vereker's reaction to the review) are not immediately clear, requiring inference.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
