Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "This is dedicated to my wife, Marie." feels disconnected)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise for clarity (e.g., "nought" is less common, "nothing" might be preferable for some readers)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing articles in a few places, inconsistent comma usage)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about some groups (e.g., "the San Juan Basketmakers" without brief explanation)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs in some sections (e.g., from discussing the cave's interior to the geographical description)
