Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "bezizened", "charing") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing the working class's Sunday and the fashionable church scene.
- [CLARITY] The insertion of unrelated, futuristic elements (e.g., "A drone swarm aligned in formation", "A robotic hand adjusted the controls", "The AI assistant adjusted the lights") disrupts the historical context and clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
