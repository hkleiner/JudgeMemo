Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is highly fragmented with multiple chapters and timelines, making it challenging to follow a cohesive narrative thread.
* [CLARITY] Overuse of vague references ("a thing", "stuff") hinders understanding of specific locations, companies, and context.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters and topics (e.g., from biography to industry trends) disrupt the flow.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology may confuse modern readers unfamiliar with early 20th-century printing and design jargon.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (first-person to second-person narrative) and a few missing articles ("a stuff" instead of "the stuff").
