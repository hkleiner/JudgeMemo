Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and meandering, making it hard to follow a clear narrative or argument structure.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of vague references ("a thing", "stuff") without clear explanation hinders understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages, biblical analysis, and defensive arguments against critics disrupt flow.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and overly formal tone may alienate some readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not convincingly supported by presented evidence.
* [GRAMMAR] Sporadic errors in punctuation (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage).
* [SPELLING] A few instances of potential spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg").
