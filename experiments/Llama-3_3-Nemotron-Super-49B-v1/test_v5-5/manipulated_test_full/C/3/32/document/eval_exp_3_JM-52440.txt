Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without a clear outline or section summaries.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of archaic language (e.g., "a thing", "stuff") and undefined terms (without immediate explanation) hinders understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitional phrases.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases ("it is...", "thus") without variation.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and Church of England documents.
