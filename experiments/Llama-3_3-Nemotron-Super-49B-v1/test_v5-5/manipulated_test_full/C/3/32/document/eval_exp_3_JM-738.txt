Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is overly complex with too many characters and plot twists, making it hard to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sections are dense with backstory or theoretical discussions (e.g., the extensive analysis of Datchery's identity) that interrupt the narrative flow.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between the analytical chapters (e.g., "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY") and the storytelling chapters can be jarring.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, the language feels overly archaic or verbose, which might hinder modern readers' understanding.
* [LOGIC] The convenience of certain plot devices (e.g., the opium hag's role, Datchery's actions) strains credibility.
