Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated narrative inserts (e.g., descriptions of Millet's "The Sower", George Stransom's story, philosophical musings on societies) disrupt the logical flow of the theological argument.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures and dense theological jargon may hinder comprehension for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters and topics (e.g., from Chapter II to III, and insertions of unrelated texts).
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases ("it is clear", "I am not ignorant") without variation.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with specific historical theological debates and documents without sufficient context.
