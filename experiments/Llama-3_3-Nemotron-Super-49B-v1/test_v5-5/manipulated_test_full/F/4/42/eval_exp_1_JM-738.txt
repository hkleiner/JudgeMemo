Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is heavily analytical and theoretical, with the narrator dissecting the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" rather than presenting a cohesive, forward-moving narrative. This disrupts the natural flow expected in a story.
* [CLARITY] The text often assumes prior knowledge of Dickens' work and its characters, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analyzing the original story, presenting theories, and discussing character identities (e.g., Datchery's) can be jarring.
* [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic language and references (e.g., "thou", "thee", less common vocabulary) may hinder modern readers' understanding.
* [LOGIC] Some speculative theories about the plot's resolution feel overly convoluted or based on unverified assumptions about Dickens' intentions.
