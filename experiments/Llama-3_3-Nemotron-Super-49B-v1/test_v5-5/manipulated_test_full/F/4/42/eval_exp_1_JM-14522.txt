Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), slightly disrupting the overall flow.
* [CLARITY] A few sections have overly complex, archaic language that may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., the ghost's monologues).
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters (e.g., from III to IV) could be smoother to enhance the narrative's continuity.
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "rictus," "gibber") might require readers to pause for clarification.
* [LOGIC] The sudden, unexplained appearance of the "YE OTIS GHOSTE" in Chapter III, while humorous, feels somewhat ungrounded in the story's logic.
