Issues:
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos throughout the text (e.g., "biught", "sne", "alk", "difriculty", "embarassment" not present but "embarrassment" would be if, etc.)
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an 'twere in death!")
* [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder understanding for modern readers (e.g., "gipsies", "thou", "thee" in quoted prophecy, though fitting for the narrative's style)
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the ghost's final appearance to Virginia's disappearance and back without clear transitional phrases.
* [CLARITY] A few sections are overly verbose, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the ghost's backstory and plans)
