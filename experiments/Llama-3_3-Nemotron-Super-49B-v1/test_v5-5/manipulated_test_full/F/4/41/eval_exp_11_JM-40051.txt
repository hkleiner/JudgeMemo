Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, cohesive structure, jumping between descriptive, argumentative, and testimonial sections without smooth transitions.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs hinder easy understanding, with some sentences exceeding 50 words.
* [REPEITITION] Repeated calls to "Come and see!" and reiterations of the garden's beauty without adding new insights.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee", outdated spellings) and overly formal tone may alienate some readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumes the reader's acceptance of the Bible as a geographical guide without addressing potential skepticism.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing the garden's features, biblical references, and personal anecdotes.
