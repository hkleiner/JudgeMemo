Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without clear section breaks or concise summaries.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex theological jargon and lengthy sentences hinders understanding for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without smooth transitions.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases (e.g., "the Church of England") without variation.
* [GRAMMAR] A few instances of unclear pronoun references and missing articles (e.g., "in the Lordâ€™s Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-" lacks a clear connecting phrase).
