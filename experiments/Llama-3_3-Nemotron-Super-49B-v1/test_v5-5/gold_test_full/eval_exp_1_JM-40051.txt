Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, linear narrative structure, jumping between descriptive passages, biblical analysis, and defensive arguments.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs hinder easy comprehension, with some sentences exceeding 50 words.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from geography to biblical interpretation to personal anecdotes) disrupt flow.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and overly formal tone may alienate modern readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not conclusively supported by presented evidence.
* [GRAMMAR] Sporadic use of commas and semicolons affects readability; a few instances of subject-verb agreement issues.
