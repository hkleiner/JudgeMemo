Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), slightly disrupting the overall flow.
* [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., the ghost's sudden desire for sleep, Virginia's immediate empathy) could be more explicitly developed for smoother understanding.
* [LEXICON] Occasional overuse of archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee" in some dialogue) might slightly hinder modern readers' fluency.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters (e.g., from III to IV) could be more seamless.
