Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without a clear outline or section summaries.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex theological jargon and lengthy sentences hinders comprehension for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitional phrases.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases (e.g., "it is clear," "thus") without variation.
* [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and documents without sufficient context.
