Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding for readers not deeply familiar with theological terminology or the specific doctrines discussed.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, with more explicit connections to guide the reader through the logical flow of ideas.
* [STRUCTURE] While the structure is generally clear, the lengthy paragraphs may detract from readability; breaking them up could enhance flow.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, the archaic language (e.g., "whosoever", "thou") and highly formal tone may reduce accessibility for modern readers.
