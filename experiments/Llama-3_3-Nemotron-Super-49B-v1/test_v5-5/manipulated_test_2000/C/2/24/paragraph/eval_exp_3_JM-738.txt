Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and story retelling (e.g., the shift from discussing Dickens's health to analyzing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood").
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense paragraphs hinder readability (e.g., the lengthy description of character relationships in "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ").
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters ("CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION" to "CHAPTER: THE STORY") and within sections (e.g., from character descriptions to the opening of the tale).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin", "fiancée" without clarification for modern readers) may confuse some audiences.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about character intentions (e.g., Jasper's motivations) are sometimes presented without clear textual evidence from the story itself.
