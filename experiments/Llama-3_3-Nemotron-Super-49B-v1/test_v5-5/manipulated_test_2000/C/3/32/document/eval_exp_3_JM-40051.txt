Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt jumps between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, hindering easy comprehension.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between ideas and sections.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou", "thee", "antldiluvians") and inconsistent terminology ("stuff" used unclearly).
* [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking the described location directly to the Garden of Eden without conclusive evidence).
* [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "And from thence,——it was which means long river...").
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "Bridtish", "jageed").
