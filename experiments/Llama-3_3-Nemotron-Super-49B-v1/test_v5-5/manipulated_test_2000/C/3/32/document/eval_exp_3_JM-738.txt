Issues: 
* [LEXICON] Repeated use of "a thing" and "stuff" appears to be placeholders or errors, disrupting fluency and clarity.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs hinder easy understanding.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, character introductions, and story openings (e.g., from discussing Dickens' health to introducing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" plot).
* [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long or convoluted, affecting readability.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about character relationships (e.g., Princess Puffer's potential relation to Jasper) are introduced without clear textual support from the provided excerpt.
