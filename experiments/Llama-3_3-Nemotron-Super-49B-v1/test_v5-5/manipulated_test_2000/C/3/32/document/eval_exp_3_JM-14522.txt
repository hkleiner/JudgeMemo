Issues: 
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of placeholder phrases ("a thing", "stuff", "the thing") disrupts fluency and clarity.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially confusing the reader.
* [SYNTAX] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances.
* [LOGIC] The character's immediate reaction to the ghost (offering lubricant) feels somewhat implausible without clearer setup for the character's eccentricity regarding such responses.
