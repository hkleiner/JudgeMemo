Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Frequent use of vague phrases ("a thing", "stuff", "a stuff corner") that disrupt understanding and require inference.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" (e.g., from school to moving, to working, without clear chronological flow indicators).
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially in the second chapter, making the narrative feel disjointed.
* [LEXICON] Overly simplistic vocabulary in some descriptions ("a dear", "cute pigtails") contrasting with more sophisticated language elsewhere.
* [SYNTAX] Occasional long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the description of the print shop's heating) that hinder flow.
