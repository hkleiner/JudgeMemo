Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases (e.g., "the stuff") without clear definition early on might confuse readers.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biblical interpretation, doctrinal explanation, and the Church of England's teachings without a clear, consistent structure.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in punctuation (e.g., missing or extra commas in long sentences).
