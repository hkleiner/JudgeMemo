Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected narrative shifts between different storylines (e.g., from a theological discussion to a ghost story to a personal drama) without clear transitions or connections.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex, dense theological explanations may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements between chapters and story segments, disrupting the flow.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terminology (e.g., "thou," "whomsoever") may hinder modern readers' understanding and flow.
* [LOGIC] The inclusion of vastly different narratives (theological treatise, ghost story, personal relationship drama) undermines the overall logical coherence of the text as a unified piece.
