Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introductory chapter and "THE STORY" chapter without a clear narrative link.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" may confuse readers.
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analytical discussion (Andrew Lang's preface) to the story narrative without a smooth handoff.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and terms (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "the first sprightly runnings") may hinder modern readers' fluency.
* [LOGIC] Unexplained motivations (e.g., Princess Puffer's actions, Jasper's opium experiments) create minor coherence gaps.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
