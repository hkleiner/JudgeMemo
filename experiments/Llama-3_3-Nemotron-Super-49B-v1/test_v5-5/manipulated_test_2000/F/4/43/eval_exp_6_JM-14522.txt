Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some sentences (e.g., "had felt" and "was" in the same paragraph).
* [LEXICON] Overuse of elaborate vocabulary in dialogue (e.g., "punctilious honour", "sanguineous Stains") that may hinder readability for some readers.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" without clear sectioning or explanation.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, reducing clarity (e.g., the description of Mrs. Otis).
* [LOGIC] The character's immediate reactions to supernatural events sometimes feel unrealistic or overly casual (e.g., Mr. Otis's response to the ghost).
