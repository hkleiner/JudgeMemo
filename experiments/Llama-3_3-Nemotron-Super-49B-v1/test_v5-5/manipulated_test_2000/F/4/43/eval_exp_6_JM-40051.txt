Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose and dense paragraphs hinder easy comprehension.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly evidenced beyond poetic license and personal conviction.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("antldiluvians", "behoeld") may alienate modern readers.
* [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and inconsistent sentence structure (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...") disrupt flow.
* [SPELLING/Grammar] Notable errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "been at lost a").
