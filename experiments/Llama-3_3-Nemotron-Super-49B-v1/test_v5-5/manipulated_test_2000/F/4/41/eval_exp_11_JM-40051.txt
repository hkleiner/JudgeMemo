Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, geographical description, and promotional tone.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, making it hard to follow the main argument.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., linking the Mississippi to the Euphrates, serpent presence as validation) lack robust evidence or logical connection.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and inconsistent tone (formal to colloquial) disrupt flow.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between sections (e.g., from description of the garden to the mention of snakes).
