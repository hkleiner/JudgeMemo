* [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tenses in some sections (e.g., "he was" and "has been" in the same paragraph)
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences hindering easy understanding (e.g., the explanation of Princess Puffer's timeline)
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., from Jasper's vision to the introduction of the Dean)
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may confuse modern readers (e.g., "gamin", "lay precentor", "opium smoking" context)
