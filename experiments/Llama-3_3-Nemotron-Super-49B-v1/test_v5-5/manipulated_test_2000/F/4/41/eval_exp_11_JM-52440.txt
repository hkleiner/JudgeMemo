Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "srrvice", "prssent", "wnd", "vby", "tue", "businessbis", "minim", "ctwo", "pf", "withe", "invisibly" repeated in context but not an error per se, "teh", "ln", "hexven", "kt", "generak", "momen")
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "now that after three hundred years...", "it is not fair that the Church should be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends")
* [LEXICON] Some archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but overall tone is formal and somewhat outdated)
* [STRUCTURE] Chapters and sections could be more clearly delineated for modern readers (though consistent with older texts)
* [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better understanding
