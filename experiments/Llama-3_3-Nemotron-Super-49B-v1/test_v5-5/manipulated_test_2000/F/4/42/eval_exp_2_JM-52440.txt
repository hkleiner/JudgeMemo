Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb conjugation (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are", "is" instead of "are")
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "beared" instead of "bear", "was" instead of "were" in some contexts, "wasn't" missing in negative sentences)
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "the point at issue is, whether... or whether...")
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better understanding
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Church's documents to expressing anxiety for the Church without a clear connector
