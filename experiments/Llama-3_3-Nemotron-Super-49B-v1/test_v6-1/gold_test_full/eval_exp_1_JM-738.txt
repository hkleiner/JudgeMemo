   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but archaic spellings may confuse modern readers (e.g., "thou", "thee" in quoted text)

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [LOGIC] Some plot conjectures feel overly speculative without clear textual basis
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear discussion of theories and evidence can be disorienting
   - [CLARITY] Overly detailed analysis of minor points may obscure the main mystery's resolution
