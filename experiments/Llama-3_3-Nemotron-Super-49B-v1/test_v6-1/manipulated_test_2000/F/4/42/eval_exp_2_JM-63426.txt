Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "It shoulded be talked about" (should be "should be")
- [GRAMMAR] "what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." (missing preposition for clarity, e.g., "opened it")
- [GRAMMAR] "the employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." (comma splice; consider semicolon or rephrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in several places)
- [SPELLING] "emancipation" (contextually correct, but worth noting for thoroughness; no actual spelling errors found)
- [SYNTAX] "In its way it was as American as the Declaration of Independence." (somewhat awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "lusty, democratic ambition" (while not incorrect, could be more clearly expressed for all readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction to Will Bradley's impact and the detailed biography in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming"
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., Kelmscott House, specific artists) without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear linking between the two chapters provided, making the narrative feel somewhat disjointed
- [LOGIC] The statement "His work has been absorbed into our culture so completely that many... are scarcely aware of their debt to him" feels somewhat unsupported without examples

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
