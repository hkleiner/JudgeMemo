Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "gamin", "precentor") might slow reading for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., "has been drinking" in a past context) are present but rare.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "THE STORY" chapter without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed character introductions might overwhelm the reader before the story's pace is established.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in scene (e.g., from Jasper's vision to the introduction of Minor Canon Crisparkle) without smooth transitions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
