1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for all readers (e.g., "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime")
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without a clear linking device
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with disparate childhood anecdotes, slightly obscuring the overarching narrative thread
- [TRANSITION] Limited transitional phrases between some paragraphs within chapters
