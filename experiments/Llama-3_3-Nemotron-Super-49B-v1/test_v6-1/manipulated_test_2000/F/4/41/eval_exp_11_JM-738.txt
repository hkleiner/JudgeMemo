- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, analysis, and story summary (e.g., shifting from Dickens's health to character analysis without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs requiring re-reading for full comprehension
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between discussing different characters' introductions and plot points
