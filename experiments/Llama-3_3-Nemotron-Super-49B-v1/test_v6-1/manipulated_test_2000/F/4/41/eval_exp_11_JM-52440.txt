Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "unvommon", "srrvice", "glessed", "prssent", "wnd", "invisibly" repeated correctly but "invisibly" in one instance may imply a different intended word)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may impede readability for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but overall tone is somewhat formal)
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the introduction and Chapter I could be more clearly defined
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs contain densely packed theological concepts that might confuse readers without a background in the subject
- [TRANSITION] Subtle disconnect between the general discussion and the specific examination of Church documents (e.g., the shift to analyzing Articles could be smoother)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
