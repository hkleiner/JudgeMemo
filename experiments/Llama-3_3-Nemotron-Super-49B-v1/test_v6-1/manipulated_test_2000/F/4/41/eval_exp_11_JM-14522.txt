- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "vety", "guarfians", "waw", "xeven", "whxt", "Myerw", "librwry", "evwrything")
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "punctilious", "guilty spirit", "phantasmata", "receptive expectations")
- [SYNTAX] A few complex sentence structures may slightly impede flow (e.g., long descriptive passages)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Some character introductions (e.g., the twins) feel slightly rushed or underexplained in relation to their significance
- [LOGIC] The sudden, unexplained appearance of the ghost in Chapter II could be more seamlessly integrated into the narrative flow
