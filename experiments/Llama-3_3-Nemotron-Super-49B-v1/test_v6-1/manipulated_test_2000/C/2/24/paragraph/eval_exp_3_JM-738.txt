Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction and the start of "The Story" chapter without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge of Dickens' works and historical context (e.g., "The Signalman") without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
