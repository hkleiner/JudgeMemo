Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It should be talked about, because...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "corn-fed") may slightly impede immediate understanding for all readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without clear thematic link explanation
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge (e.g., historical art movements, specific historical figures' impacts) without brief contextualization

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
