Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between Dickens' narrative and the main story
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "mumbling", "guilty spirit", "phantasmata")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "was frightened" to "have been glad")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected narrative shift from Chapter I to a discussion on Christmas (later resolved, but initially jarring)
- [LOGIC] Unexplained, fantastical elements (e.g., the ghost's appearance and reaction) may confuse readers unfamiliar with the genre
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between some paragraphs (e.g., from describing family members to the drive to Canterville Chase)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
