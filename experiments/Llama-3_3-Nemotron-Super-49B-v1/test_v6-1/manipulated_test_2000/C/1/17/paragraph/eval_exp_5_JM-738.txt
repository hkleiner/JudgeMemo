Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture", "thou") and overly formal tone might reduce readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Dickens' writing style to a personal anecdote about Christmas, disrupting thematic flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed character introductions in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" could overwhelm readers before the story's context is fully established.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
