Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between different narrative styles (e.g., from religious discussion to ghost story to personal reflection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "sifting time", "sacramental appointment") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (not specified due to format constraints, but noticeable in shifts between past and present in different story segments)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic or narrative connection between distinct story segments (religious, ghost, personal)
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shifts in context without transitional elements
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overly dense with complex, unrelated ideas (e.g., mixing theological debate with personal anecdotes without clear connection)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
