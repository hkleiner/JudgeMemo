Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "In America, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "stir in its sleep", "corn-fed")
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (repeated, appears to be a placeholder or error, e.g., "in a thing, Massachusetts")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Overly vague references (e.g., repeated use of "a thing" without specification)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs within chapters

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
