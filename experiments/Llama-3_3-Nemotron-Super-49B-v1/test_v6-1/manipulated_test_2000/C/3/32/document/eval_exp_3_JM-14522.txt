Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "a thing" (repeated placeholder for a noun, disrupting natural flow)
- [SYNTAX] "since my grandaunt... (long, complex sentence without clear punctuation for modern readers)
- [SPELLING] None noted, assuming "a thing" and similar are intentional placeholders
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "when they came to discuss terms" (could imply a meeting for discussion, slightly unclear without context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of "a thing" (repeated, unspecified term)
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained appearance of the ghost in Chapter II without prior narrative hint in that chapter
