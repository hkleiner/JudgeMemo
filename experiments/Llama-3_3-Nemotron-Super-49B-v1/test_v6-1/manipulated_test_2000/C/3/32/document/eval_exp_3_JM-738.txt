Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a stuff", "a thing") for unclear reasons, disrupting clarity.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "If she has been dealing in opium for ten years...").
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "Mr." and "Jasper" without title in some instances).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, character introductions, and plot analysis (e.g., shift from Dickens's health to character descriptions).
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstories that may confuse readers without prior knowledge.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters ("CHAPTER: THE STORY") and within sections (e.g., from opium den scene to character list).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
