Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple places (e.g., "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic language usage (e.g., "stuff" likely meant "Church", "thou", "thee" not present but "whomsoever" is)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article ("a thing" instead of "a specific thing" in some contexts, though contextually understandable)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Scripture to the Church of England's documents without clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs requiring multiple readings for full comprehension.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between the introduction of the problem and the analysis of the Church's documents.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
