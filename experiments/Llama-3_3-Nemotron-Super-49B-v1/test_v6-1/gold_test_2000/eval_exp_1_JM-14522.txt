Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "whilst", implied by context though not directly used here, and "gyves") might require brief pauses for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the family's daily activities to the ghost's appearance without a transitional paragraph, though this is somewhat intentional for dramatic effect.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter I to II could benefit from a clearer temporal or thematic bridge.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
