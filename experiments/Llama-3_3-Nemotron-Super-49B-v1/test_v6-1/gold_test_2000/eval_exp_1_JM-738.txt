Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analysis, backstory, and plot introduction without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Dickens' works and historical context might confuse some readers.
