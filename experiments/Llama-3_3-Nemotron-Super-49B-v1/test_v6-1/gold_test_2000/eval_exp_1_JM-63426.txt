Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It is graduation day... You are six years old; next month you will be seven.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pi", "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear linking device.
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge (e.g., historical context, specific art movements) might confuse uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
