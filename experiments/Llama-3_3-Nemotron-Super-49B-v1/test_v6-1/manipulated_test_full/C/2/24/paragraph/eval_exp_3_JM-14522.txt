Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] "embarassment" (not present, but "emerald-green" and other creative color terms are used correctly, indicating overall strong spelling)
   - [LEXICON] Overuse of elaborate, less common vocabulary might hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "punctilious", "sanguineous", "gibber")
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slow reading flow

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) without clear transitions
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations and actions (e.g., the ghost's final transformation) could be more explicitly explained
   - [LOGIC] Suspension of disbelief required for certain plot elements (e.g., the ghost's interactions, the final resolution)

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
