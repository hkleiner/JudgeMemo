Evaluation Form:

1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "unaccountable expedition", "femme fatale" connotations without clear context)
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., lengthy, embedded clauses)
   - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (though rare and not distracting)

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [LOGIC] Some plot speculations feel overly speculative without clear textual backing
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear analysis and multiple theory presentations can confuse the narrative flow
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Datchery's true identity and purpose) are not fully resolved or clearly explained

3. **FINAL Coherence Score**: **3.5**

4. **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4**
