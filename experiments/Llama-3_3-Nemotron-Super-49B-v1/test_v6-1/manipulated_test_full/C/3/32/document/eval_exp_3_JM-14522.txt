- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences may impede flow for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and actions (e.g., the ghost's final transformation) could be more explicitly explained
