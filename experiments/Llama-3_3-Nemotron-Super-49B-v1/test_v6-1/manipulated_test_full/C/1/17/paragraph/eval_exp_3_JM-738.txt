Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "heaven's-hard", "gamin", "femme fatale" connotations without clear context)
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., long, nested sentences)
   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but some archaic spellings/terminology may confuse modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [LOGIC] Some plot points rely heavily on convenient coincidences (e.g., Datchery's identity, the opium hag's role)
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative and multiple unresolved threads may confuse readers
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Jasper's backstory, Datchery's actions) could be more clearly defined

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
