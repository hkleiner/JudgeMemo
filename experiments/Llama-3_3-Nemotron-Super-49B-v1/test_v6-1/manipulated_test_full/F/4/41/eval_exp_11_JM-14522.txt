Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "biught", "sne", "teh", "enemys", "thres", "recumbent posture" is correct but "recumbent" might be less common for some readers)
   - [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "punctilious", "gibber", "phosphorescent")
   - [SYNTAX] A few complex sentence structures may slightly impede flow

2) **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) without clear transitional cues
   - [CLARITY] Some character motivations and actions (e.g., the ghost's final transformation, Virginia's decision to help the ghost) could be more explicitly explained
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from comedic to deeply emotional tones without gradual transition

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4**

4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.5**
