1. **Fluency Issues**: 
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "thee") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentence structures.
   - [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but some archaic spellings (consistent with the period style).

2. **Coherence Issues**: 
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative can disorient readers expecting a strictly chronological biography.
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different periods of the author's life without clear transitional phrases.
   - [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are dense with names and events, potentially overwhelming without prior context.
