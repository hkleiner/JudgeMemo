Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "hyacinthine locks", "gipsy type")
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "As become and the clear-understand fragment under, ’s meaning one babblings, half revealed, concealed Jasper one points")
   - [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but some archaic spellings and punctuation (e.g., "’s" instead of "'s")

2. Coherence Issues: 
   - [LOGIC] Some plot points rely heavily on convenient coincidences (e.g., Datchery's appearance, the opium hag's role)
   - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative and multiple unresolved threads may confuse readers
   - [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Datchery's true identity and purpose) are not clearly resolved
