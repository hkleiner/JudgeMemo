- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "teh" instead of "the" in some places, though not prevalent)
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee") and overly formal language in some dialogues

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Some plot transitions (e.g., Virginia's disappearance and return) feel abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] The ghost's final transformation and Virginia's experience could be more explicitly explained
