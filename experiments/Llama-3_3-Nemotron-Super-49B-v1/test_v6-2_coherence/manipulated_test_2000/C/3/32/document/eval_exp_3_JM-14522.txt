Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering immediate understanding.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the family's daily activities to the ghost's appearance at night feels somewhat disconnected.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
