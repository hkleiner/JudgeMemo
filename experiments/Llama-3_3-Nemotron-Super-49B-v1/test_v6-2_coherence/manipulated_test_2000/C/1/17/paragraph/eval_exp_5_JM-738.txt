Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introductory analysis of Dickens' work and the descriptive scene with Stransom (seems disconnected from the main topic of Dickens's last plot)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in the introductory chapter may hinder smooth understanding for some readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Dickens's writing style to a personal anecdote about Christmas (lacks a clear connection to the preceding or following text)
- [LOGIC] The quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts appears unrelated to the surrounding context about Jasper and Edwin

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
