Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Will Bradley's impact to analyzing Dickens's last plot without clear connection or resolution.
- [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of the detailed, fictionalized childhood narrative ("CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING") to the introductory chapter's topic (Will Bradley's Chap Book) without explicit linking.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the two chapters, disrupting the flow.
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of unrelated narrative segments (e.g., the story about Stransom and Creston) that do not logically contribute to the discussion of Will Bradley.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
