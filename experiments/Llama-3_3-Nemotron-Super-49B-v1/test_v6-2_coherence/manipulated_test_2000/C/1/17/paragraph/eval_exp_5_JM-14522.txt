Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing "The Canterville Ghost" and a seemingly unrelated passage about Dickens and Edwin Drood.
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained shift to a narrative about Stransom and Paul Creston, disrupting the main storyline.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the introduction of the Otis family and the preceding, unrelated narratives.
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent narrative flow, with multiple storylines (Canterville Ghost, Dickens, Stransom) intertwined without logical progression.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
