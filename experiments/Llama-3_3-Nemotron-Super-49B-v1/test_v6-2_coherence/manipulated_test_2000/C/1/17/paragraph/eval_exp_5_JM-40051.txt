Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Jasper, Rosa, Mrs. Umney, George Stransom without connection to the main Eden discovery topic)
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose and descriptive passages hindering the main argument's flow
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between vastly different scenes and topics
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking the Mississippi to the Bible's Euphrates without historical or biblical evidence)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
