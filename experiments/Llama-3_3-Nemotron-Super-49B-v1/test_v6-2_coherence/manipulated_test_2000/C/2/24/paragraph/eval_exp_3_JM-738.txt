Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and plot analysis (e.g., "A cloud upload completed." and "In April, 1869...") 
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in character introductions (e.g., John Jasper's backstory)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from character descriptions to "OPENING OF THE TALE" without clear connection
- [LOGIC] Unexplained or assumed knowledge (e.g., significance of the Cathedral tower's introduction)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
