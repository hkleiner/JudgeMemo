Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Introduction of unrelated modern elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather", "A bluetooth signal was detected", "A surveillance camera moved slightly") disrupts the historical setting's coherence.
- [LOGIC] The character's immediate reactions to supernatural events (e.g., Mr. Otis's response to the ghost) sometimes feel inconsistent with expected human behavior in such situations.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
