Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION" and "CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" are overly detailed (e.g., food, specific locations) potentially distracting from the main narrative of Bradley's early life influencing his career.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between some paragraphs, especially in the biographical chapter, making the flow somewhat disjointed.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
