1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy paragraphs without clear subsections for enhanced readability.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., explanations of sacramental beliefs).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's documents to diving into the specifics of the Real Presence doctrine without a clear transitional phrase.
