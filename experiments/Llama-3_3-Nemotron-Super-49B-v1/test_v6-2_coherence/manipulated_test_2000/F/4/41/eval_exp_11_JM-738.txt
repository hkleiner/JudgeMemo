Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the Introduction and Chapter: THE STORY without a clear connecting sentence or paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" may confuse readers without a visual aid or simpler explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analyzing Dickens's work to introducing the story's characters without a smooth bridge.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
