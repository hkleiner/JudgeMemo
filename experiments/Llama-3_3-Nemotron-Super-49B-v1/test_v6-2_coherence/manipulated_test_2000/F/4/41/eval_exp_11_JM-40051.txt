Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between biblical context and personal discovery narrative
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive language obscures main argument at times
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between paragraphs (e.g., shift from description of Eden's location to discussing the town site of Trempealeau)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's characteristics (e.g., lack of mineral wealth) are not clearly justified

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
