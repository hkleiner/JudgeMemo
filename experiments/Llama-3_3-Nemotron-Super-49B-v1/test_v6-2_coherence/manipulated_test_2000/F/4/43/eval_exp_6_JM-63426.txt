Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, anecdotal narrative in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" may distract from the overall coherence with the introductory chapter's thematic focus.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader smoothly between paragraphs in both chapters, especially in the second chapter's rapid scene changes.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
