Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and plot analysis (e.g., shift from Dickens's health to _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_ plot without clear connection)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in character descriptions (e.g., convoluted explanations of relationships and backstories)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between chapters (e.g., from "INTRODUCTION" to "THE STORY" without a clear link)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions without clear evidence (e.g., speculations on character intentions without textual support)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
