Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy paragraphs without clear subsections or breaks, potentially hindering flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are convoluted and dense, making comprehension challenging (e.g., the paragraph starting with "That the material food...").
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Church of England's documents to the personal concern for the Church's state without a smooth connector.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
