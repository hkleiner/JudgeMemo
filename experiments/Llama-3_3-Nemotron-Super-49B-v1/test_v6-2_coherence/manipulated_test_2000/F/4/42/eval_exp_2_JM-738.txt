Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the Introduction and Chapter: THE STORY, lacking a clear connecting sentence or paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory in "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" section, potentially confusing without a visual aid or simpler explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from analytical discussion in the Introduction to detailed character descriptions without a smooth bridge.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
