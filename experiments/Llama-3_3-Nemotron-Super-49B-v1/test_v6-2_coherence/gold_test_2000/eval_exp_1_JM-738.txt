Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and story analysis (e.g., shift from discussing Dickens' health to introducing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without clear connection)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex character relationships and backstory (e.g., multiple, intertwined family ties and roles require close attention to follow)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jumps between scenes (e.g., from Jasper's opium den to Cloisterham without transitional phrases)
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about character intentions without clear textual evidence (e.g., inferring Jasper's motivations from limited descriptions)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
