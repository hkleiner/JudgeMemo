1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapters without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" are overly detailed (e.g., food, specific locations) potentially distracting from the main narrative of Bradley's early life influencing his career.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between some paragraphs in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING", making the flow somewhat disjointed.
