Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] **Abrupt Transitions Between Unrelated Topics**: The text frequently shifts between discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper and completely unrelated topics (e.g., descriptions of artworks, personal anecdotes, literary analyses) without logical connection or warning, disrupting the flow.
- [CLARITY] **Overly Complex Sentencing and Vocabulary**: The use of excessively complex sentences and archaic vocabulary may hinder understanding for readers not familiar with 19th-century theological discourse or literary references.
- [TRANSITION] **Lack of Clear Sectioning for Distinct Ideas**: Despite chapter headings, the text fails to smoothly transition between major topics (e.g., from Real Presence to Adoration to Sacrifice), and the inclusion of unrelated passages disrupts coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**
