Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with frequent tangents (e.g., discussions on cyclones, geological age, and dairy farming) that disrupt the main argument's flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions and lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, making it hard to follow the author's train of thought.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., the garden's location being central to the continent implying its identification as Eden) are not always logically connected to conclusions.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in topic (e.g., from describing the garden to discussing the Bible's description of time) without smooth connections.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
