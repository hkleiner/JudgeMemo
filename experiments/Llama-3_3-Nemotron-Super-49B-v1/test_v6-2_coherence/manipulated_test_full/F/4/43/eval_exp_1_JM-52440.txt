Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Overly lengthy chapters and sections without clear transitional phrases between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing the Real Presence to Adoration without a connecting paragraph).
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and lengthy sentences that may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear section summaries or previews to guide the reader through the author's logical progression.
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of theological debates and Church of England documents without sufficient contextualization.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
