1) **Coherence Issues:**
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between life events and thematic discussions.

  - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between chapters, making the flow disjointed.
  - [LOGIC] Some sections (e.g., the lengthy description of 1895's design influences) feel tangential to the overall biographical coherence.
