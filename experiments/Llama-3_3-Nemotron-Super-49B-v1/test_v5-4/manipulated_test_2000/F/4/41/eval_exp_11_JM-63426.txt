* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "wre" instead of "were", "cderivative" instead of "derivative", "therecder" instead of "there were", "qant" instead of "want", "esucation" instead of "education", "ro" instead of "to", "og" instead of "of", "towan" instead of "town", "prdss" instead of "press", "boardcand" instead of "board and", "isbalways" instead of "is always")
* [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tenses in some paragraphs
* [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly long or convoluted, slightly hindering immediate understanding
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introduction chapter and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without a clear narrative link
* [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may confuse modern readers (e.g., "Yelpow Book", "esquisite")
