Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "deserfed", "ajd", "oef", "apopldxy", "notvout", "disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper’s birth" - inconsistency in timeline calculation, "tjhis", "svholar", "giod", "bettothal", "unintelligiboe", "muscular Christian in the pink of training" - unclear phrase)
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentence structures are awkward or overly complex (e.g., "the restraint which she puts on her 'tigerish blood' is admirable")
* [CLARITY] A few sections are dense with character introductions and backstory, potentially overwhelming the reader (e.g., the "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" section)
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analysis to the start of "THE STORY" without a clear connector
* [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "gamin", "precentor", "fiancée")
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing Dickens's health and writing style to diving into the story's characters and plot
