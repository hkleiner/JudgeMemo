Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos throughout the text (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "vety", "tuey", "reavhed", "Yhe", "evwrything", "librwry", "Myerw", "obpong", "anmold", "rhe")
* [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "which he never ceased to regret" feels slightly out of place)
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and could be broken up for better flow (e.g., the description of Mrs. Otis)
* [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Chapter I to II without a clear narrative bridge
* [LOGIC] The character's reactions to supernatural events, while humorous, sometimes border on implausibility for the sake of comedy
