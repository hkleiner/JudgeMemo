Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "srrvice", "prssent", "worsteds", "teachingsct", "invisibly" repeated with slight variation, "ln" instead of "in", "tye" instead of "the", "kt" instead of "it", "generak" instead of "general", "mannon" instead of "man")
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as ifmthey, and they only, were the true expositors of the Churchâ€™s doctrime.")
* [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity for modern readers (e.g., "vommon", "best-establisjed", archaic language)
* [STRUCTURE] The transition between the introduction and Chapter I could be smoother
* [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better understanding
