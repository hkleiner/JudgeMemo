Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb conjugation (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are", "is" instead of "are") throughout the text.
* [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies (e.g., "beared" instead of "bear", "signify" instead of "signified" in some contexts, though "signify" can be correct depending on the intended meaning).
* [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "invisibly worked", "effectual signs").
* [STRUCTURE] The transition between discussing Scripture and diving into the Church of England's documents could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are excessively long and convoluted, potentially causing confusion.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the specific doctrines and biblical references without brief contextualization.
