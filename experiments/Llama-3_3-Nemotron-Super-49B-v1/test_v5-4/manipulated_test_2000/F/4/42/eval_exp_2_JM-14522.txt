Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "had come" with "reckoned", "was" with "am", "woulded did", "have been spilt", "have fallen", "have tried", "have been lock", "have a light supper", "have learn", "is awakened", "have bring", "was completely efficacious", "would be happy")
