Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "has am" instead of "was")
* [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors (e.g., "emancipation" correctly used but "it shoulded" instead of "it should have")
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long or awkwardly structured
* [CLARITY] A few transitions between paragraphs could be smoother for better flow
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing Bradley's impact to his childhood story without a clear connector
