Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases (e.g., "it is my belief," variations of "the Church of England") without significant variation.
* [STRUCTURE] While generally logical, the deep dive into specific Articles and interpretations might benefit from a clearer signposting of how each section contributes to the overall argument.
* [SYNTAX] A few instances of awkward phrasing (e.g., "the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.") appear to be typographical or transcription errors.
