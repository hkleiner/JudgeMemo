Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, hindering easy comprehension.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between sections (e.g., shift from describing the garden's location to discussing snakes).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and inconsistent tone (formal to somewhat casual).
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's characteristics and location are not fully supported by presented evidence.
* [SYNTAX] Several sentences with awkward phrasing or incomplete thoughts (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a, ...").
* [SPELLING/Grammar] Noted errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "commencing more than half way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top" - clarity issue but also somewhat grammatical).
