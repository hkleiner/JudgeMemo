Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Frequent use of "a thing" instead of specific nouns (e.g., "a thing, Massachusetts", "the thing corner of the Common", "a stuff") causes confusion and disrupts flow.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" (e.g., from school to moving, to working, without clear chronological markers).
* [LEXICON] Overly simplistic vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "a dear" to describe Miss Parrot) contrasts with more vivid language elsewhere.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially in the second chapter, where new scenes start without clear connections to the previous ones.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, hindering easy understanding (e.g., the paragraph describing the print shop's conditions and tasks).
