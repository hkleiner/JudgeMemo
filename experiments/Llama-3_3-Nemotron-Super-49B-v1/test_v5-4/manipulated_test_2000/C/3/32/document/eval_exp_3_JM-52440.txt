Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases (e.g., "at this present time", "in such a state of things") without variation.
* [STRUCTURE] The introduction of the Church of England's documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies) feels somewhat abrupt; a clearer lead-in would improve structure.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with the theological context and specific doctrines without brief contextualization for a broader audience.
