Issues: 
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of placeholder phrases ("a thing", "stuff") disrupts immersion and indicates incomplete editing.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the family's daily concerns to the ghost's appearance without a clear transitional phrase, slightly disconnecting scenes.
* [CLARITY] Mrs. Umney's warning and the family's immediate reaction could be more clearly connected to the subsequent events for smoother flow.
* [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially hindering smooth reading flow (e.g., the description of the family's conversation topics).
