Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description.
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose sentences and paragraphs, hindering easy comprehension.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between sections (e.g., from discussing the Bible to describing the Mississippi River area).
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("antldiluvians", "thou", inconsistent use of "stuff" which seems to be a placeholder or error) and unclear terms ("the thing").
* [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "antldiluvians" likely a typo, missing articles, inconsistent verb tenses).
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not strongly evidenced beyond personal impression and selective biblical interpretation.
