Issues: 
* [ANACHRONISM] Incongruous modern elements (hologram, bluetooth signal, surveillance camera) disrupt the historical setting.
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering immediate understanding.
* [LEXICON] Occasional word choices (e.g., "sanguineous" in casual family discussion) may be overly formal for the context.
* [LOGIC] The family's immediate, varied reactions to the ghost (from denial to academic interest) feel somewhat inconsistent.
