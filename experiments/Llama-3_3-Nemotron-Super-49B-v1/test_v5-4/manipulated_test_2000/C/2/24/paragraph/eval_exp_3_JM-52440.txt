Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between philosophical/theological discussions and unrelated, modern technological references (e.g., "The voice recognition module powered up," "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb," "The biosensor updated its readout") that disrupt the narrative's historical and thematic coherence.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense theological jargon may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters and ideas, with topics sometimes feeling abruptly introduced or concluded.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou," "thee") mixed with modern terms (technological references) creates inconsistency in tone and era.
* [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with specific Christian doctrines and scriptures without sufficient contextualization for a broader audience.
