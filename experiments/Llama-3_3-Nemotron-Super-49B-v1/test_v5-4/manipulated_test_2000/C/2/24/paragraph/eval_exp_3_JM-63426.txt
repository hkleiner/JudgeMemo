Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the first chapter and the second without a clear narrative link or indication of a shift in focus (from discussing Will Bradley's impact to his childhood story).
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding (e.g., descriptions of Will's early life events).
* [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the timeline of Will Bradley's life in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming".
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary or context-dependent terms without explanation (e.g., "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime") that might confuse some readers.
* [SYNTAX] Infrequent but noticeable awkward phrasing (e.g., "the energy grid remained balanced" seems out of context and unrelated to the narrative flow).
