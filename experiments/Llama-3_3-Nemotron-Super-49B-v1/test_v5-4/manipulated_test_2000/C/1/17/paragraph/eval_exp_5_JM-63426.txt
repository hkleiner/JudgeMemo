Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Will Bradley's work to a narrative about Stransom and then to Bradley's biography without clear connections.
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences or conclusions, making the flow unclear (e.g., the shift from Bradley's impact to a detailed, unrelated anecdote).
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters and within narratives (e.g., from "AN INTRODUCTION" to "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING").
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, the vocabulary feels overly formal or archaic for a biography aiming for broad readability (e.g., "emancipation", "perennial springtime freshness").
* [LOGIC] The inclusion of the Stransom narrative seems logically disconnected from the rest of the text focused on Will Bradley.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor: "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on Baltimore Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear! You are six years old; next month you will be seven." (Unnecessary shift in tense and perspective without clear narrative benefit)
