Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between completely unrelated story segments (e.g., from a theological discussion to a ghost story to a personal drama without connection).
* [CLARITY] Overly complex and dense theological explanations may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements or narrative bridges between distinct story chapters/scenes.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whomsoever", "particular hours") may hinder modern readers' fluency.
* [LOGIC] The inclusion of unrelated stories (ghost story, personal drama) disrupts the logical flow focused on the theological debate.
