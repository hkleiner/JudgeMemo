Issues: 
* [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between discussing the Canterville Ghost and a seemingly unrelated passage about Dickens and Edwin Drood (no clear connection to the story).
* [STRUCTURE] Chapter I includes a large, unconnected narrative block about Stransom and Paul Creston (appears to be from a different story, "The Beast in the Jungle" by Henry James), disrupting the story's flow.
* [CLARITY] The insertion of a philosophical passage about Christmas (unrelated to the plot) confuses the narrative.
* [TRANSITION] Sudden, unannounced shift from the Otis family's interactions to the description of Mrs. Otis and her children (lacks smooth transition).
* [LEXICON] Some archaic language and long, complex sentences may hinder smooth reading for modern readers.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor: "I said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friendâ€™s introduction." (Could imply the speaker is the one being introduced, slightly unclear).
