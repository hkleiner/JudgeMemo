Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Jasper, Rosa, Mrs. Umney, and George Stransom with no connection to the main Eden narrative)
* [CLARITY] Overly verbose and dense paragraphs hindering easy comprehension
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between vastly different scenes and topics
* [LEXICON] Archaic language and phrasing (e.g., "antldiluvians", "pleasantry") that may confuse modern readers
* [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims about the Garden of Eden's location without clear evidence
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in punctuation (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage)
