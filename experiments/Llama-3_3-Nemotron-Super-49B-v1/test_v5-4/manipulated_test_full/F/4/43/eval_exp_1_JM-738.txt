Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is overly complex with too many characters and plot twists, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sections are verbose and lack clear transitions between scenes, causing confusion.
* [LOGIC] Certain plot points (e.g., the use of quicklime, Datchery's identity) rely on convenient coincidences or lack thorough explanation.
* [LEXICON] While mostly rich, some descriptions (e.g., character appearances) are overly detailed and slow the narrative.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between past reflections, present actions, and theoretical discussions about the plot's direction disrupt the flow.
