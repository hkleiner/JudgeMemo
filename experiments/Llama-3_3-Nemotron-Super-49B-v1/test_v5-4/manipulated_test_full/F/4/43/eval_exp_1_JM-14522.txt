Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative flow (e.g., Chapter IV's lengthy description of the ghost's attempts seems slightly tangential).
* [CLARITY] A few sections have overly complex sentences or outdated language that may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "fear smiling ghost have Canterville I," though this appears to be a transcription error).
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between some chapters (e.g., from Chapter V to VI) could be smoother to enhance the overall narrative continuity.
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary or phrases (e.g., "sanguineous family connected") might require a dictionary for some readers.
* [LOGIC] The sudden, unexplained appearance of the "YE OTIS GHOSTE" in Chapter III, while humorous, feels somewhat unexplained and could benefit from slight setup or foreshadowing.
