Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without a clear outline or section breaks beyond chapter headings.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic language and lengthy sentences hinders immediate understanding for modern readers.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and chapters could be smoother to guide the reader through the argument.
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "verily") may confuse contemporary readers.
* [LOGIC] Some arguments rely on the assumption that the reader is deeply familiar with the historical context of the Church of England and its doctrines.
