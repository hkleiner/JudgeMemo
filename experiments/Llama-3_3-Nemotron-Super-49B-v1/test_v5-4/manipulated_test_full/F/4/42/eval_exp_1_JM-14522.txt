Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), disrupting the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions and dialogue sometimes obscure the plot progression.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones can be jarring.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language, while fitting for the ghost's character, may hinder modern readers' fluency.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in verb tense (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in a few instances).
