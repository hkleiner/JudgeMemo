Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, linear narrative structure, jumping between descriptive, argumentative, and testimonial sections without smooth transitions.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs hinder easy comprehension, with some sentences exceeding 50 words.
* [REPETITIVENESS] Repeated calls to "Come and see!" and descriptions of the garden's beauty, though effective in emphasis, become redundant.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "Euphrates" for Mississippi) may confuse modern readers.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about the Garden of Eden's location are not universally supported and rely heavily on unverified personal beliefs.
* [SYNTAX] Sporadic use of commas and lack of clear paragraph breaks disrupt fluency.
* [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "teh", "recogntion", "envirnoment") detract from professionalism.
