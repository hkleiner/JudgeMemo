Issues:
* [SPELLING] Multiple typos throughout the text (e.g., "biught", "sne", "alk", "difriculty", "enemys", "thse", "teh", "charecter", "recumbent posture" is correctly spelled but contextually awkward)
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an 'twere in death!")
* [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading (consistent with the story's style, but may affect fluency for some readers)
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly between the ghost's attempts and the family's daily life without clear transitional phrases at times
* [CLARITY] A few sections require close reading to understand the ghost's actions and their consequences due to dense, elaborate descriptions

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
