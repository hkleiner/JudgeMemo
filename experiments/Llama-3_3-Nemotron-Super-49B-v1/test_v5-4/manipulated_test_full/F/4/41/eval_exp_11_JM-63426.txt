Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is highly fragmented with multiple chapters that jump between different periods of the protagonist's life without clear transitions, making it hard to follow the narrative flow.
* [CLARITY] Overuse of specific, unreferenced names (e.g., Mr. Newett, Mr. Kasten) and events without context can confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject's history.
* [LEXICON] Archaic terms (e.g., "pk", "Gordon press", "Caslon Black") and industry jargon may hinder understanding for non-experts.
* [GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION] Sporadic lack of punctuation (e.g., missing commas, periods) and inconsistent paragraph formatting.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters and topics (e.g., from biography to industry trends) disrupt coherence.
