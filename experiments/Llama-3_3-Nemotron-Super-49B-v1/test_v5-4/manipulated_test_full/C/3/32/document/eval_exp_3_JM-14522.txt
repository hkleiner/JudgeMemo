Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative flow (e.g., Chapter IV's lengthy description of the ghost's attempts seems slightly tangential).
* [CLARITY] A few character motivations and backstory elements (e.g., the ghost's historical actions) are overly elaborate and slightly obscure the main plot.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be smoother; the narrative jumps abruptly from the ghost's failed attempts to Virginia's pivotal interaction.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, the archaic language and lengthy descriptions of settings or characters' appearances slow the pace.
* [LOGIC] The sudden, unexplained appearance of the "YE OTIS GHOSTE" and its immediate impact on the Canterville Ghost feels somewhat convenient.
