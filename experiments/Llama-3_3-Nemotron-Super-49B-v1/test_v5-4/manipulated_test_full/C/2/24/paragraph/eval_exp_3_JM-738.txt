Issues: 
* [COHERENCE] The story's complexity and multiple unresolved plot threads (e.g., Datchery's identity, Edwin's fate) may confuse readers, affecting overall coherence.
* [FLUENCY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading flow.
* [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Jasper's actions, Datchery's goals) are not always clear, requiring close attention from the reader.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between analysis, story retelling, and theory discussion, which might disrupt the reading experience.
* [LEXICON] Archaic terms and references (e.g., "hyacinthine locks," "Grecian nose") may alienate modern readers unfamiliar with the period's language and cultural context.
