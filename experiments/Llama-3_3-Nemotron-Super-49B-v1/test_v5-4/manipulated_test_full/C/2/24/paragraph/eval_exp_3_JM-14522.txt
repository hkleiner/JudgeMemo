Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the main narrative arc (e.g., Chapter IV), disrupting the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions and outdated language may confuse modern readers in several passages.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between humorous and somber tones (e.g., from ghostly encounters to the family's daily life) can be jarring.
* [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "methinks", "egad") may hinder fluency for some readers.
* [LOGIC] The ghost's ability to interact physically (e.g., using a dagger, being wet) contradicts typical ghost lore, causing minor logical inconsistencies.
