Issues:
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes (e.g., sudden shifts from narrative to philosophical musings unrelated to the plot, such as the discussion on animal adaptation and the Filipino dinner description).
* [CLARITY] Some characters' motivations and actions lack clear explanation (e.g., the ghost's sudden desire for sleep, Virginia's immediate empathy without full backstory).
* [TRANSITION] Chapters often start without smooth connection to the previous one, disrupting flow.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, word choice feels overly elaborate or archaic for modern reading comfort (though this may be intentional for the story's Victorian setting).
* [LOGIC] A few plot points rely on convenient coincidences (e.g., the almond tree blossoming precisely at the ghost's death).
* [SYNTAX] Minor instances of long, winding sentences that slightly hinder readability.
