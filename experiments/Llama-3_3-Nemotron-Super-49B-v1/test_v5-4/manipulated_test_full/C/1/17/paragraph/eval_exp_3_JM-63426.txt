Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is highly fragmented with multiple chapters and timelines, making it challenging to follow a cohesive narrative thread.
* [CLARITY] Overuse of names, events, and historical references without clear contextualization may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject's life or the era.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between chapters and topics (e.g., from biography to design philosophy to historical events) disrupt the flow.
* [LEXICON] While mostly clear, some archaic terms and industry jargon (e.g., specific printing technologies) might require clarification for non-expert readers.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies and long, winding sentences impair readability in several sections.
