Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theological discussions and unrelated narrative snippets (e.g., descriptions of art, unrelated character stories) disrupt the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense theological jargon may hinder understanding for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between chapters and sections, with topics sometimes feeling tangentially introduced.
* [LEXICON] Repetitive use of certain phrases ("our blessed Saviour", etc.) without variation.
* [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge of specific theological debates and historical events without sufficient context.
