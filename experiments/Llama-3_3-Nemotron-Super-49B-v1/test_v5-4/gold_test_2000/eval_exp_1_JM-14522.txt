Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Slight disjoint between Chapter I and II in terms of immediate plot progression, though overall narrative flow is maintained.
* [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the transition from the family's everyday conversation to the sudden appearance of the ghost, though context clues help.
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "sanguineous", "gyves") might hinder flow for some readers, but enriches the narrative for others.
* [TRANSITION] The shift from the stain's repetition to the family's drive and then to the ghost's appearance could be smoother.
