Issues: 
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate understanding for less academically inclined readers.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow from one idea to the next.
* [STRUCTURE] While generally well-structured, the lengthy paragraphs may benefit from subdivision for easier digestion of information.
* [LEXICON] Occasionally, archaic language (e.g., "whosoever", "thou") may slightly impede fluency for modern readers not accustomed to such vocabulary.
* [LOGIC] The assumption that the Church of England's doctrine can be uniformly discerned from the selected documents without acknowledging potential internal historical debates or interpretations might be overly simplistic.
