Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly between analysis, backstory, and the opening of the tale without clear transitional phrases, disrupting the flow.
* [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and dense paragraphs make comprehension challenging for the reader.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") may hinder understanding for modern readers without historical context.
* [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Dickens's health and writing style to diving into "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"'s plot feels disconnected.
* [LOGIC] The assumption about the Princess Puffer's timeline and potential relation to John Jasper is introduced without sufficient buildup or clarity.
