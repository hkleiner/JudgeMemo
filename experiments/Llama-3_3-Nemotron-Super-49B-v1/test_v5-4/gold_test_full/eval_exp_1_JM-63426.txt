Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Some chapters feel disconnected from the overall narrative arc, particularly the later chapters which jump between different projects without clear transitions.
* [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed fashion descriptions in "The Gay Nineties") sometimes obscure the main points or slow the narrative.
* [LEXICON] Archaic terms and industry jargon (e.g., specific printing technologies) may confuse modern readers without background knowledge.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between personal anecdotes, historical context, and professional achievements disrupt the flow.
* [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation errors and inconsistent verb tenses (noted in the afterword as part of the editing challenge) are present but do not severely impact understanding.
