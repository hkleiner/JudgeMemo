Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow without a clear outline or section breaks beyond chapter headings.
* [CLARITY] Excessive use of complex, archaic vocabulary and sentence structures may hinder comprehension for non-specialist readers.
* [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing different Church documents (e.g., Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitional phrases.
* [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou", "thee", etc.) in quoted material not consistently modernized or contextualized for clarity.
* [GRAMMAR] Occasional lack of parallel structure in lists and comparisons.
