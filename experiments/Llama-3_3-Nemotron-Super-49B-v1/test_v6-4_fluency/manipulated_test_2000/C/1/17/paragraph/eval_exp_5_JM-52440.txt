Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transitions between different narrative styles (e.g., from religious discussion to ghost story to personal reflection) without clear connections.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "sifting time", "sacramental appointment") that may hinder smooth reading for non-specialist readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent chapter formatting and sudden shifts in topic (e.g., from "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION" to unrelated narratives) disrupting flow.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
