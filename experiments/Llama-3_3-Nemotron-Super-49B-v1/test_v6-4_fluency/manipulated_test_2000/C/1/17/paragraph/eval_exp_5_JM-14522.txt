Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between chapters and topics (e.g., sudden shift from describing the Otis family to discussing Christmas sentiments without clear connection)
  - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "sanguineous", "phantasmata")
  - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances (not prevalent but noticeable upon close reading)
  - [STRUCTURE] Chapter II starts without a clear narrative link to the end of Chapter I, potentially disrupting flow

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
