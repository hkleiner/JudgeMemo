1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., from Garden of Eden to Jasper and Rosa, then to Mrs. Umney, and others without clear transitions)
- [COHERENCE] Lack of overall text unity; multiple unrelated storylines and topics (Garden of Eden discovery, personal relationships, office settings)

- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent paragraph lengths and topics, disrupting flow
