Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "munger")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analytical introduction to narrative without clear transitional phrase (between preface and "CHAPTER: THE STORY")
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent narrative voice/tone in some sections (e.g., sudden insertion of dialogue with "Well, so does the family doctor...")

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
