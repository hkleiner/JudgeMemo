Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "gamin", "fianc√©e" without italics or explanation for general readers) might cause minor comprehension pauses.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analytical commentary and narrative summary (e.g., from discussing Dickens' health to analyzing "Edwin Drood" characters) without clear transitional phrases.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
