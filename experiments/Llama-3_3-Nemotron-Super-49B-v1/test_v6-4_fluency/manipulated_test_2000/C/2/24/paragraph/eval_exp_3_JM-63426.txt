Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences that slightly impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air.")
- [LEXICON] Infrequent use of less common vocabulary might slow some readers (e.g., "emancipation", "stuffy", "gaiety")
- [TRANSITION] Slight disconnect between the end of "AN INTRODUCTION" and the start of "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clear thematic bridge

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
