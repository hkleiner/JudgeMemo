Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Sudden, unrelated sentences ("The voice recognition module powered up." and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb." and "The biosensor updated its readout.") disrupting the text's flow.
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic language may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "whomsoever", "thou", implied but not directly listed).
- [STRUCTURE] Long, dense paragraphs without clear subsections or breaks, potentially overwhelming the reader.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
