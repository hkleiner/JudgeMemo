Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today...") may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "gaiety", "stir in its sleep", "corn-fed") might require a brief pause for less familiar readers.
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent, but noticeable, lack of commas in lists (e.g., "cars steamboats trains drawings of sailboats") could enhance readability.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
