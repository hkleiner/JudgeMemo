Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Incoherent sentence structure in Mr. Otis's response to Lord Canterville ("I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can...").
- [LEXICON] Abrupt shift in tone and language use in Washington Otis's dialogue ("Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time"), feeling slightly anachronistic.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage) throughout the text.
- [SYNTAX] Sudden, unexplained transition in the narrative flow at "CHAPTER: nothing" which disrupts the reading flow.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
