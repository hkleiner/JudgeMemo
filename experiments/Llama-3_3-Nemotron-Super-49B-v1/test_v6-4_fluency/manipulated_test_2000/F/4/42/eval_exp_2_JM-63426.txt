Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "It shoulded be talked", "was know", "donâ€™t worked", "was on the Narrow Gauge", "you was hungry", "you are went", "you was to get", "you are sorry", "you went out", "you and your devil forage", "you are not that important", "you are spoken of as foreman")
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect tense consistency (e.g., "you was" instead of "you were" in multiple instances)
- [SYNTAX] Repetitive sentence structure in biographical narrative sections
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "stiffy", "lusty", "exquisite backwater")
- [SPELLING] "emancipation" (correct, but contextually noted for flow), "stiffy" (likely meant "stuffy"), "lusty" (contextually appropriate but contributes to less fluent reading for some)
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of commas for clarity in long sentences

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
