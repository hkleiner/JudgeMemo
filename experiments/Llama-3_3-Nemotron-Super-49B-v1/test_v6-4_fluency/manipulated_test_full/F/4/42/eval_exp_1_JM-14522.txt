1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
  - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "thou", "whilst", "methinks" not present but implied through style) might require additional cognitive effort from modern readers.
  - [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent narrative pacing; some sections are densely descriptive, while others are more dialogue-driven.
