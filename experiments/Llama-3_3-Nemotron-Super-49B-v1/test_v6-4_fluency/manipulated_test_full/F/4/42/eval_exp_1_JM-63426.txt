Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues:**
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "verily") may hinder modern readers' understanding.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (often exceeding 30 words) can disrupt flow.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional inconsistent verb tense changes (e.g., past to present without clear narrative reason).
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent use of modern punctuation conventions (e.g., limited em dashes, inconsistent comma usage).
- [STYLE] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed fashion descriptions) may slow pacing for some readers.
