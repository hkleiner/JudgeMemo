Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods." could be more concise)
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readers' flow (e.g., "sundry", "thou", "thee")
  - [PACING] Long, uninterrupted chapters and paragraphs may disrupt reading rhythm
  - [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent character voice (e.g., the ghost's dialogue sometimes feels too modern)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
