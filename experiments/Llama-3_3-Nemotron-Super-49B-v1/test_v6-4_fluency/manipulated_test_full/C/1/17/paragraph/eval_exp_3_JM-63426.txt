Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues:**
  - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "methinks", "whilst") may cause minor comprehension delays for modern readers.
  - [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences in some chapters (e.g., "THE GAY NINETIES") might disrupt flow for some readers.
  - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between biography and historical context) could slightly confuse without careful attention.
  - [TRANSITIONS] Abrupt shifts between personal anecdote and industry commentary (e.g., in "TOWARDS A NEW STYLE") might feel disjointed.

2) **FINAL Fluency Score:** **4**
