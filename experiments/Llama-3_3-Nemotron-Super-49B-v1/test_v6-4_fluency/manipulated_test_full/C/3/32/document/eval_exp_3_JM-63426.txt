Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues:**
- [LEXICON] Overly verbose and archaic language in some sections (e.g., "the stuff", repeated placeholders for proper nouns)
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures, especially in reflective or descriptive passages
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent narrative voice (first-person and second-person references to the author)
- [NAVIGABILITY] Lack of clear chapter summaries or transitions between vastly different time periods and topics
- [TYPOGRAPHY (IMPLIED)] Frequent mentions of missing or placeholder text ("the thing", "a stuff") suggest potential formatting or content gaps

2) **FINAL Fluency Score:** **3.5**
