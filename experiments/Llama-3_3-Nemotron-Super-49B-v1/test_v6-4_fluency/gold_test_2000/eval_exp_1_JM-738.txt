Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin") might require additional context or lookup for full comprehension.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analytical discussion and narrative summary (e.g., from introduction to "The Story" chapter) without clear transitional phrases.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
