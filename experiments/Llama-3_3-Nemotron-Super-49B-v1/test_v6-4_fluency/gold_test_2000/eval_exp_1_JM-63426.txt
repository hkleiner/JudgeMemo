Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences that slightly impede immediate clarity (e.g., the paragraph starting with "In America, these goings-on...").
  - [LEXICON] A few instances of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "stout") that might require a brief pause for some readers.
  - [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent use of commas in lists could slightly affect flow (e.g., "sailboats, steamboats, ferryboats, trains of cars, houses, people and animals" lacks commas after each item for optimal clarity).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
