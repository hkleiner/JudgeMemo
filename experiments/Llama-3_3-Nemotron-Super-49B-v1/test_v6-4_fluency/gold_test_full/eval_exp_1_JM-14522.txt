Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "gibber", "rascal", "genteel").
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may disrupt flow (e.g., Chapter I's opening dialogue).
  - [GRAMMAR] Mostly consistent, but a few instances of outdated grammatical structures (e.g., "had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms").

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
