Evaluation Form:

1) **Fluency Issues:**
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "whipper-snapper", "gadzooks") may cause minor comprehension delays for modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] Infrequent use of complex, winding sentence structures that, while poetic, slightly impede flow.
- [CONSISTENCY] Slight inconsistencies in narrative voice (first-person to second-person references to the author) but do not significantly impact readability.

2) **FINAL Fluency Score:** **4.5**
