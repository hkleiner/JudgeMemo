1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "unaccountable expedition", "femme fatale" connotations without clear context)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between chapters and ideas
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative language ("I conjecture", "may have") in analytical sections
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "If I am right, it was easier for Helena, a girl, to pose as a young man, than for Drood to reappear as a young man, not himself.")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between theoretical discussions and evidence from the text

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
