1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "pi", "Vandyke", "Piccadilly collars") might require additional context for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between different periods of the author's life without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions of historical settings and less relevant events might distract from the main biographical flow.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
