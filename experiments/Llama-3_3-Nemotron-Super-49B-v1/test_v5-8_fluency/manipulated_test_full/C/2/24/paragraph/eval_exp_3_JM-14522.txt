1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but implied by overall style) and overly formal language might challenge modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) require close attention.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with descriptive or conversational content, potentially overwhelming the reader.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
