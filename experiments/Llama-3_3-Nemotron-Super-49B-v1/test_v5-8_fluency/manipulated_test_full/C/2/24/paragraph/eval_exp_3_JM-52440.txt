1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") and formal tone may reduce readability for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy paragraphs and lack of section breaks (beyond chapter headings) can make navigation challenging.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense, potentially causing confusion without careful reading.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
