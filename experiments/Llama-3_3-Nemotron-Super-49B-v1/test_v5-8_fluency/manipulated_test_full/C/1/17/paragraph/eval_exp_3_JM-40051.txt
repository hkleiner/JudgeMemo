1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "antldiluvians", "nugatory", "unaproachable")
- [CLARITY] Frequent tangents and lack of clear transitions between ideas
- [GRAMMAR] Sporadic use of commas and inconsistent punctuation
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt topic changes (e.g., shift from Garden of Eden to George Stransom's story)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
