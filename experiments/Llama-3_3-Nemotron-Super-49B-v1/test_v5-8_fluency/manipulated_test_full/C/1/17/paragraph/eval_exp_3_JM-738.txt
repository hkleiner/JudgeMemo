1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst", "veritable") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure and abrupt scene changes can disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of hypothetical scenarios and theories within the text obscures the main narrative.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between chapters and ideas (e.g., sudden shifts from story to analysis).
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional outdated grammatical constructions (e.g., "I do think", "it doth seem").

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
