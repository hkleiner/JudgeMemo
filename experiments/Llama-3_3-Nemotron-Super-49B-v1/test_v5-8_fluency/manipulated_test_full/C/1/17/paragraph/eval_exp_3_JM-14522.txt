1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but implied by overall style) and overly formal language might challenge modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., sudden shifts from story to unrelated philosophical musings) can disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long, contributing to reader fatigue and reducing clarity.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
