1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", in quoted material) and theological jargon may challenge modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between quoted texts and the author's analysis; lack of clear section headings beyond chapter titles.
- [CLARITY] Repetitive explanations of the same theological points across different chapters.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unannounced shifts to unrelated topics (e.g., descriptions of artworks, unrelated narratives).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
