1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "pi", "type-stick", "galleys") and industry-specific jargon might require clarification for non-experts.
- [CLARITY] Frequent shifts between narrative styles (first-person, second-person, reflective) and time periods can disrupt flow.
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chapter summaries or transitional phrases between vastly different time periods or topics.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] **None Noted** on a significant scale; minor typos possible but not encountered in the provided excerpt.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
