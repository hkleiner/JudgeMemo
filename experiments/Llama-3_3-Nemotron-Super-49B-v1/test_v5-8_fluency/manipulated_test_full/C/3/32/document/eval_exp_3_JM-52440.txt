1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a thing", "stuff", "thou") and outdated Vocab (e.g., "Ritualist") may require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy paragraphs and lack of section breaks (beyond chapter headings) can make navigation and quick understanding challenging.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly verbose, potentially obscuring the main point for readers not fully engaged.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
