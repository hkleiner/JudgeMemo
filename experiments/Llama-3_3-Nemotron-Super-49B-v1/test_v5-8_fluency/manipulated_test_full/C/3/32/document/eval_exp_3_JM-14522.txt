1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", implied but not consistently used; instead, modern equivalents are mixed with antiquated expressions) and overly formal language might challenge contemporary readers.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are excessively long, potentially leading to reader fatigue.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) without clear transitional cues.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] **None Noted** (assuming the intentional archaic spellings and grammar are exempt)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
