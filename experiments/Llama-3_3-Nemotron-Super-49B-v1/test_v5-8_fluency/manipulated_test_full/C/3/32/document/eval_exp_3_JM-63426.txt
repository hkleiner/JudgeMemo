1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst" not present but implied by overall tone)

- [CLARITY] Excessive use of ellipses ("...") for transitions between unrelated ideas
- [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences impair readability
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different time periods and topics
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles and inconsistent verb tenses
