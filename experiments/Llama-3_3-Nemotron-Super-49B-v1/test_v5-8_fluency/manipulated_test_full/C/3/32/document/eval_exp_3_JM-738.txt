1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst", "forthwith") may hinder readability for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Extremely long paragraphs and chapters without clear sectioning can disrupt the flow.
- [CLARITY] Frequent assumptions of prior knowledge about Dickens, his works, and the context of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" may confuse unfamiliar readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analysis, theory discussion, and narrative summary can be jarring.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional use of incomplete sentences and rhetorical questions for effect may slightly impede smooth reading.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
