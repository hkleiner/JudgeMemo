1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter III's opening paragraph)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "gibber," "sanguineous")
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) can slightly disrupt flow
- [SPELLING] None noted (assuming the text's intentional archaic spellings are accepted)
- [GRAMMAR] Mostly flawless, with minor exceptions (e.g., "it was of no avail" feels slightly forced in modern context)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
