1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., lengthy sentences with multiple clauses).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thou", "thee", in quoted liturgical texts) may slightly hinder modern readability.
- [STRUCTURE] The text's extensive use of unreferenced quotes and lack of clear section headings (beyond chapter titles) can disrupt flow for some readers.
- [CLARITY] Infrequent use of transitional phrases between paragraphs discussing different documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.) can make the text feel somewhat disjointed.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
