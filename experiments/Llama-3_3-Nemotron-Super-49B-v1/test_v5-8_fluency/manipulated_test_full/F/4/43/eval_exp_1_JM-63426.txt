1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures in several chapters (e.g., "THE GAY NINETIES", "COLLIERâ€™S AND OTHERS") may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "pi", "type-stick", "galleys") and industry-specific jargon (e.g., "Golding press", "Miehle presses") might confuse non-expert readers.
- [CLARITY] Frequent shifts between narrative styles (first-person, second-person, reflective) and time periods can disorient the reader.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters or topics (e.g., from "THE WAYSIDE PRESS" to "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK") lack cohesive linking.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or extra commas in lists) throughout the text.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
