1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "unaccountable expedition", "femme fatale" connotations without clear context)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt transitions between past, present, and theoretical discussions
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of speculative language ("I conjecture", "may have", "it is possible") hindering clear plot progression
- [LENGTH] Extremely lengthy paragraphs overwhelming the reader
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent character depth (e.g., detailed descriptions of some, minimal for others like Mr. Tartar)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
