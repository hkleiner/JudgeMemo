1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It should be talk about, because it is hard to realize today...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "gaiety, courage, vitality", "stir in its sleep", "lusty, democratic ambition") may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers
- [CLARITY] Infrequent but noticeable lack of clarity due to long, winding narratives or assumed historical context (e.g., references to specific historical figures/events without brief explanations)
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters could be smoother; abrupt shifts in time and topic (e.g., from biography to industry trends)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
