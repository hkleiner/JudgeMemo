1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., lengthy sentences with multiple clauses).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") may slightly hinder modern readability.
- [STRUCTURE] The text's extensive use of quotes and references without clear section breaks or summaries might disrupt flow for some readers.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
