1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "unintelligible", "supranormal", "fancifully") may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Extremely long paragraphs and chapters without clear section breaks disrupt the flow.
- [CLARITY] Frequent shifts between narrative, analysis, and theory (e.g., transitioning from story summary to author's intentions) can confuse the reader.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional outdated or archaic sentence structures (e.g., "I do not, in fact, call these probable occurrences in every-day life, but none of the story is probable.") may cause minor confusion.
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some proper nouns (e.g., character names) are consistently capitalized, which is correct but may slow reading due to their frequency and uniqueness.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
