1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "biught" instead of "bought", "sne" instead of "she", "teh" instead of "the", "difriculty" instead of "difficulty", "enemys" instead of "enemies", "thier" instead of "their", "recumbent" instead of "recumbent" is correct but contextually questionable, "x" used instead of "the" in several places)
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., tense shifts, "was" instead of "were" in a few instances)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for all readers (e.g., "punctilious", "gibber", "phial", "gyves", "manacles", "wainscoting")
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences with complex or overly long structures, potentially affecting clarity

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
