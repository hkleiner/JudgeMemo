1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst", "gibber") and overly formal tone might challenge modern readers unfamiliar with Victorian English.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between ghost's backstory and present) require close attention from the reader.
- [CLARITY] Some long, descriptive paragraphs could benefit from division for enhanced readability.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
