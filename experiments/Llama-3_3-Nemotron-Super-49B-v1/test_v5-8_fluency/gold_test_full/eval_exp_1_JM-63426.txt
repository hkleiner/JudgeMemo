1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whipcord", "pi") may cause minor comprehension delays for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative structure across chapters may slightly disorient readers expecting a strictly chronological autobiography.
- [CLARITY] Some long, unpunctuated, or complex sentences (e.g., in the "NEW FIELDS" chapter) could benefit from clearer segmentation for easier reading.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between some chapters (e.g., from "THE GAY NINETIES" to "SPRINGFIELD: THE WAYSIDE PRESS") without clear connecting narrative threads.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
