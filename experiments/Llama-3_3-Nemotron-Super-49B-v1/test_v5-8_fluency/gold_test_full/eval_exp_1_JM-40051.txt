- [SYNTAX] Repetitive sentence starters and lack of varied sentence length for flow.
- [LEXICON] Overuse of effusive, poetic language that sometimes obscures clarity.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt topic shifts without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages that, while vivid, delay the main argument.
