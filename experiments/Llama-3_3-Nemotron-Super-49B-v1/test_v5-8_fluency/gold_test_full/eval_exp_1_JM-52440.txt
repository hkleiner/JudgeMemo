1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst") and theological jargon may require additional interpretation for non-specialist readers.
- [STRUCTURE] The text's lengthy paragraphs and lack of section breaks (beyond chapter headings) can make navigation and quick comprehension challenging.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
