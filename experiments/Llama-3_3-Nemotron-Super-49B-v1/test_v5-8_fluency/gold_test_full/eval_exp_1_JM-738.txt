1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "puddingstone", "gamin", "fiddlestrings") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Extremely long paragraphs and chapters can disrupt the flow and make the text feel dense.
- [CLARITY] Frequent shifts between narrative, analysis, and theory (e.g., transitioning from story summary to author's intentions) can confuse the reader.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially causing confusion (e.g., the sentence starting with "Meanwhile Edwin visits Grewgious...").

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
