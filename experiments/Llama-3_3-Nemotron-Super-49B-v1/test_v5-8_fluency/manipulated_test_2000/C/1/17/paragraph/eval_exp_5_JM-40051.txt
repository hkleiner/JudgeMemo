1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences (e.g., first paragraph) 
- [LEXICON] Archaic language use (e.g., "antldiluvians", "beheld", "saucy school-girl") 
- [CLARITY] Abrupt, unconnected narrative shifts (e.g., introduction of Jasper and Rosa, Mrs. Umney, George Stransom) 
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of cohesive transitions between ideas and sections 
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage) 
- [COHERENCE] Entire sections seem unrelated to the main topic (Garden of Eden discovery)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
