1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., the long, descriptive sentences in the character introductions).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "hab nab at a venture", "saucy school-girl") might require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the introductory analysis to the narrative of "The Story" without a clear transitional phrase or sentence.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly dense with information, making it hard to follow the relationships and backstory at first read (e.g., the detailed family and financial connections in the Dramatis Person√¶).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
