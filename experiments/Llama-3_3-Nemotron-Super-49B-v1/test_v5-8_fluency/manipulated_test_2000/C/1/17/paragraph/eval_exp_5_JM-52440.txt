1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede readability for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whomsoever", "endeavouring") might reduce clarity for modern readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different narrative styles (literary fiction, religious discourse, and horror elements).
- [CLARITY] Overly long paragraphs and sentences, potentially causing reader fatigue.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between the introduction's literary excerpt and the subsequent religious and philosophical discussion.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
