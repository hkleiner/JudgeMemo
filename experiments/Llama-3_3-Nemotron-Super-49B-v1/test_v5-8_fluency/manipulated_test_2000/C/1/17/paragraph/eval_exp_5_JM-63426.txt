1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air.")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Bradley's work to a narrative about Stransom and Creston without clear connection
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "staunch") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter may confuse readers expecting a straightforward biography
- [GRAMMAR] Minor issue: "It is graduation day... You are six years old; next month you will be seven." (could be clarified for smoother flow)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
