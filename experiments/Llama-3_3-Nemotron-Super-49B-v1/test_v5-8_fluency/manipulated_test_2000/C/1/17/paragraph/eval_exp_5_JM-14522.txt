1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaping", "ravaged mask", "mumbling") might require additional processing time for less advanced readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing "The Canterville Ghost" to a seemingly unrelated passage about Christmas and then back, potentially disrupting narrative flow.
- [STRUCTURE] Mixing of what appears to be two distinct narratives (one clearly "The Canterville Ghost" and another unrelated text snippet) without clear delineation or connection.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
