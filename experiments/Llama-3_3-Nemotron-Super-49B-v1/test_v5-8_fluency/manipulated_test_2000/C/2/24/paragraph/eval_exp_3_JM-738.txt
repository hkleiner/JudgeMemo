1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "demned", "gamin", "lubricity" not present but "lubricity" type words) might require additional mental processing for modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analytical discussion to "DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†" without a clear transitional phrase or sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the introduction to character descriptions without a smooth transition, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly long or convoluted, potentially reducing readability (e.g., the sentence describing John Jasper's opium use and its implications).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
