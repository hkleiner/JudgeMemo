1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whomsoever") and theological jargon might reduce accessibility for non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation and Church of England doctrine without clear transitional phrases.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few places (e.g., "is" with "have been" in close proximity, though not critically distracting).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
