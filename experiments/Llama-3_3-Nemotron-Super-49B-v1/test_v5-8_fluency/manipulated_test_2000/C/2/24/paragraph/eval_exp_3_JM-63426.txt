1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences that could be broken up for better flow (e.g., the first paragraph of "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "pi" in typesetting context, "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime") might confuse modern readers without context
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of "AN INTRODUCTION" and the start of "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clear link or divider beyond the chapter title
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures/events (e.g., Kelmscott House, specific artists and their movements) without brief explanation

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
