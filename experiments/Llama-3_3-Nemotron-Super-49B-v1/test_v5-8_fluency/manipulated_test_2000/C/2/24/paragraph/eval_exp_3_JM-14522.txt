1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slight awkwardness in long, compound sentences (e.g., "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening...") 
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic product placements (e.g., "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover", "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator") may distract some readers
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A surveillance camera moved slightly" (context unclear)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
