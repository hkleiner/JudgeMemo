1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "antldiluvians", "thoroughly satisfied", "providentially")
- [REPEAT] Repetitive use of "stuff" (clearly a placeholder, but disrupts fluency)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are too long or convoluted, hindering immediate understanding
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "admirirg", "commistes", "jageed")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between ideas or paragraphs

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
