1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "whilst", implied by context though not directly present, and "gyves") might require additional cognitive effort for less experienced readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Chapter and scene transitions are mostly smooth, but the abrupt shift in tone and subject matter within paragraphs (e.g., from describing nature to the ghost's appearance) could slightly disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are lengthy and packed with detail, potentially causing minor readability issues.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
