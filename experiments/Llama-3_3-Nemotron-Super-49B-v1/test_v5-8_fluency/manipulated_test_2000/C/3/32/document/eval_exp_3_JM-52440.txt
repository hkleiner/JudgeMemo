1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede immediate clarity (e.g., first paragraph).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("stuff" likely a typo for "Church" or similar, "thou"/"thee" not present but "whomsoever" suggests slightly formal tone).
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from discussing Scripture to the Church of England's teachings).
- [REPEAT] Slight repetition in emphasizing the distinction between material and spiritual food without adding new insight each time.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
