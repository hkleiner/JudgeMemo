1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long, nested sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "a stuff", "gamin", "precentor") might require additional context or lookup for less experienced readers.
- [CLARITY] Infrequent lack of specificity (e.g., repeated use of "a thing" instead of a specific noun) causes minor confusion.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context, literary analysis, and narrative summary in the introduction.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
