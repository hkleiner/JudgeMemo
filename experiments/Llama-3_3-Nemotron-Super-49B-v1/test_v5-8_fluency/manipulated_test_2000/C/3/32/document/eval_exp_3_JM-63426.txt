1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It is graduation day... You are six years old; next month you will be seven.")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague placeholder ("a thing") instead of specific nouns, disrupting clarity
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long, making focus difficult to maintain
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between scenes or topics without clear connectors
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (though rare and not severely distracting)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
