1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Incoherent sentence structure in Mr. Otis's response to Lord Canterville ("I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can...").
- [LEXICON] Unnatural word choice and phrasing in some dialogue (e.g., "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation").
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained transition from Chapter I to "CHAPTER: nothing" with a disjointed narrative start.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing or misplaced commas in long sentences).
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt end to the evaluated text without a clear chapter conclusion or transition.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
