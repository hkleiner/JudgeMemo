1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "As seemed read revealed the-appeared to fragment, half to clear opium...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gamin", "precentor", "picaresque") might require additional context for all readers.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are wordy or convoluted, potentially slowing the reader (e.g., "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched...").
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between some paragraphs or topics could be smoother for enhanced flow.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
