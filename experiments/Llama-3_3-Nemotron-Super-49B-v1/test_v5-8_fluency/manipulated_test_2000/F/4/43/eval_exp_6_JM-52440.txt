1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language and phrasing (e.g., "whosoever", "doth", "thee" implied in "the believerâ€™s heart feeds spiritually on the other")
- [CLARITY] A few sentences with unclear or ambiguous connections to the preceding context (e.g., the abrupt transition after "These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.")
- [REPEAT] Mild repetition in explaining the contrast between the Church of England's doctrine and others (could be enhanced for clarity without repetition)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
