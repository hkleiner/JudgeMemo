1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "they am", "we was", "it woulded")
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "was" instead of "were" in some places, mixed past and present tenses)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "In did this, our first business...")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity for modern readers (e.g., "beared" likely meant "bear" or "pertained")
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors (e.g., "beared", "was" in "was the present question" - context suggests "is")

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
