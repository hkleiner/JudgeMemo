1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "he certainly write", "We may thought", "he was to see", "he might had fallen")
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear reason)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Youth will was served")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices seem slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "amused", "unlooked-for sallies", "fain")
- [SPELLING] None noted
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between some paragraphs could be smoother for better flow
- [CLARITY] A few sentences require re-reading due to complexity or ambiguity (e.g., explanations of character relationships)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
