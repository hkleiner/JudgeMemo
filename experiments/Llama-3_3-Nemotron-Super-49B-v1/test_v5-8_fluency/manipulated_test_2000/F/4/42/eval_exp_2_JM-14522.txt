1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "every one tell", "they come", "it may had resisted", "the family go", "Mr. Otis have", "the twins am", "Washington have", "the blood-stain has been much admire", "the library have been lock", "all doubts about... am removed")
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies (e.g., "had been frightened", "was frightened" in the same context)
- [SPELLING] "recollect" not present but "recollect" is correct, however "woedn't" (should be "wouldn't"), "am see" (should be "have been seen")
- [SYNTAX] Word order and phrase structure anomalies (e.g., "which he never ceased to regretted", "as they am always getting swished")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary without clear contextual necessity (e.g., "punctilious", while correct, may be less familiar to some readers)
- [STRUCTURE] Some long, winding sentences may impede immediate clarity

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
