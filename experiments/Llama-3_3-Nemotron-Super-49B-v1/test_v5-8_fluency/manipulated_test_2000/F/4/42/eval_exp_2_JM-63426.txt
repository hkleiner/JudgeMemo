1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "barriers being demolish everywhere" (should be "barriers being demolished everywhere")
- [GRAMMAR] "In America, these goings-on am know to a few connoisseurs" (should be "In America, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs")
- [GRAMMAR] "it isn’t Europe’s leadership he followed" (consider "he didn't follow Europe's leadership" for clarity)
- [GRAMMAR] "he take off into a career" (should be "he took off into a career")
- [GRAMMAR] "We have never have any more indigenous art than Bradley’s" (should be "We have never had any more indigenous art than Bradley’s")

- [GRAMMAR] "it don’t worked" (should be "it didn't work")
- [GRAMMAR] "he thrill him to spoke to thousands" (should be "it thrilled him to speak to thousands")
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement throughout the text, especially in the second chapter (e.g., "you was", "there is often a cold cod-fish cake to was found")
- [SPELLING] None noted
- [SYNTAX] Frequent use of simple sentences; varied sentence structure could enhance readability
- [LEXICON] "gaiety, courage, vitality" (effective, but some word choices could be more precise or contemporary)
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between chapters could be smoother, with a clearer connection between the introductory chapter and the biographical narrative
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, reducing clarity (e.g., the description of Bradley's impact)
