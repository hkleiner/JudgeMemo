1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "had venture to published", "I is ignorant")
- [SPELLING] Misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "moralized" not present but "moral" is used in a way that suggests a typo for "moralized" might have been intended elsewhere, however "moral" is correct in context)
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It has appeared in brief articles... in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "veritable", "antideluvians", "thoroughly satisfied")
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences hindering understanding (e.g., the long, descriptive paragraphs about the garden's location and features)
- [SPELLING] "Bridtish" (should be "British")
- [GRAMMAR] "was being settled and inhabit" (should be "was being settled and inhabited")
- [SPELLING] "consitutes" (should be "constitutes")
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded have been" (should be "would have been")
- [SPELLING] " Literally alive with rattlesnakes." (missing quotation start, assuming it's a quote)
- [GRAMMAR] "as Christians have take possession" (should be "as Christians have taken possession")
- [SPELLING] "was disappearing" (inconsistent verb tense)
- [GRAMMAR] "mirroring their shining beauties into our faces" (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "jageed" (likely a typo, possibly "jagged")
- [GRAMMAR] "was being effaced" (inconsistent verb tense with the rest of the paragraph)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
