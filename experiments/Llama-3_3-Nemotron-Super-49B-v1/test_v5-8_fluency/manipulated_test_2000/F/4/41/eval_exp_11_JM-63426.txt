1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "wre" instead of "were", "cemts" instead of "cents", "qant" instead of "want", "esucation" instead of "education", "ro" instead of "to", "og" instead of "of", "towan" instead of "town", "prdss" instead of "press", "boardcand" instead of "board and", "isbalways" instead of "is always")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary may hinder readability for all audiences (e.g., "Narrow Gauge", "picklelime", "esquisite")
- [SYNTAX] Infrequent but noticeable lack of commas for clarity in long sentences

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
