1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "fsw", "tuey", "reavhed", "Myerw", "librwry", "evwrything", "anmold", "rhe", "unoted")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices seem slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading (e.g., "simce", "whilst" implied but not directly used, "thou" not used but tone suggests antiquity)

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
