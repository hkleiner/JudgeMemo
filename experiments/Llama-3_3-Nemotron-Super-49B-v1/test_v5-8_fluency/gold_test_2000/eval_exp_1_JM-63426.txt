1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences that could be broken up for better flow (e.g., the paragraph starting "In America, these goings-on...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety", "emancipation", "paymaster", "Narrow Gauge") that might slightly hinder readability for all but the most literate readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative tone and style between the introductory chapter and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without clear transitional elements.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are somewhat ambiguous or require a second read due to complex structure or assumption of specific historical knowledge (e.g., the context of Kelmscott House).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
