1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede immediate clarity (e.g., first paragraph).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("thou", "thee", not present but "whomsoever") and formal tone may slightly hinder modern readability.
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, with some abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from doctrine explanation to the Church's state).

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
