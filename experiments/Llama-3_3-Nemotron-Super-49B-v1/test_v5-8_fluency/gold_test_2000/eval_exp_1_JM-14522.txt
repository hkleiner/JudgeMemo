1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sundry", "gyves", "receptive expectations") might require additional cognitive effort for less advanced readers.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Chapter I to Chapter II without a clear transitional phrase, which might slightly disrupt the flow.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
