1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin", "fain") might require additional effort for comprehension.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between historical context, literary analysis, and plot summary could be smoother in a few instances.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
