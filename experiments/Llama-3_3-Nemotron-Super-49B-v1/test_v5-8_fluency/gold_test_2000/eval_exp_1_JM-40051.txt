1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent;")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "veritable", "antldiluvians", "antideluvians", "beau ideal")
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "admirirg", "commencement" not present but "commenced" is correctly used, however "Bridtish" instead of "British")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive and argumentative paragraphs
- [GRAMMAR] Sporadic lack of subject-verb agreement (e.g., "The river and bottoms are about two miles wide... and play their dances" - unclear subject for "play")

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
