Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of the given story. First, I need to read through both chapters carefully. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The first thing I notice in the text are grammatical errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "It should be talked about." There's also "realized" instead of "realize," "demolish" instead of "demolished," and "take off" without "take." These errors disrupt the smooth reading. 

Also, some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased. Like, "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appeal to him" should be "appealed." Subject-verb agreement issues here. Then in the second chapter, there are a lot of tense inconsistencies. The narrative switches between past tense and past perfect without clear reason, which might confuse the reader. For example, "you was" instead of "you were" repeatedly. That's a big fluency problem because it's distracting and shows lack of consistency.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about organization, logical flow, transitions, and consistency. The first chapter seems to have a clear structure, introducing Will Bradley's impact. But there's a sudden shift to European artists without a clear connection explained. The transition to talking about Bradley's use of colonial typography feels a bit abrupt. It could use smoother transitions between paragraphs.

The second chapter, "The Boy Printer," has a lot of fragmented scenes. The narrative jumps from school to moving, to working at the press, without clear connections between each event. The use of "you" as the narrative voice is unusual and might cause confusion. Also, there are unresolved references, like the mention of Theodore Roosevelt's libel case, which isn't explained further. It feels like a random detail. 

Additionally, in coherence, the second chapter's structure is somewhat disjointed. Events are listed chronologically but lack cohesive linking. The story relies heavily on the reader piecing together the timeline, which isn't always clear. For example, the switch from being at home with the father to moving to Ishpeming happens quickly without much transition.

So, for fluency, the main issues are grammatical errors, tense inconsistencies, awkward phrasing, and incorrect word choices. These definitely bring the score down. Maybe a 2 or 3? But since the text is mostly understandable despite errors, maybe 3?

For coherence, the structure in the second chapter is weak, transitions are poor, and some references are unclear. The first chapter is better organized but has some abrupt shifts. Overall, coherence might be a 2 because the disjointedness is more pronounced, especially in the second part.

Wait, but the first chapter does have a logical flow overall, even with some transitions. The second chapter's problems are more severe. So coherence score might average to a 2.5, but since we have to use integers, maybe 2?

But let me check again. Fluency: despite errors, the text is mostly readable. Maybe 3 for fluency because while there are issues, it's not completely opaque. Coherence: the second chapter really struggles, so overall coherence is 2.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**  

#### **Fluency (3/5)**  
1. **Grammatical Errors**: Frequent subject-verb mismatches (e.g., "it don’t worked," "was" instead of "were"), incorrect verb forms (e.g., "shoulded," "realized"), and punctuation inconsistencies.  
2. **Tense Inconsistencies**: Unexplained shifts between past simple and past perfect in "The Boy Printer" (e.g., "you was," "would be").  
3. **Awkward Phrasing**: Wordy or unclear constructions (e.g., "the turbulent current... appeal to him").  
4. **Redundancy**: Minor repetition (e.g., emphasizing Bradley’s "American" style multiple times without added depth).  

#### **Coherence (2/5)**  
1. **Abrupt Transitions**: Sudden shifts in "Introduction" (e.g., from Bradley’s impact to European art movements without clear links).  
2. **Fragmented Structure**: "The Boy Printer" lacks cohesive scene connections, relying on disjointed vignettes (e.g., moving to Ishpeming, working at the press, circus day).  
3. **Unresolved References**: Untroduced details (e.g., Roosevelt’s libel trial, "the old army game") assume prior knowledge.  
4. **Narrative Voice**: Unconventional second-person perspective ("you") disrupts immersion and clarity.  
5. **Lack of Transitions**:
