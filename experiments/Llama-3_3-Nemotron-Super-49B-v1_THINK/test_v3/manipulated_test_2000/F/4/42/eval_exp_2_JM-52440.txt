Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically the Real Presence. It's structured with an introduction and a first chapter.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, etc. Looking at the text, there are several grammatical errors. For example, "blind consent is blindly give" should be "blindly given." Also, "the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" is a bit wordy. There are subject-verb agreement issues like "those who was loyal" instead of "were." Punctuation seems mostly okay, but some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. Word choice is formal but sometimes archaic ("thou," "thee"), which might affect modern readability. Despite the errors, the overall structure is logical, but the frequent grammatical mistakes and complex sentences hinder smooth reading.

Now coherence. Coherence is about organization, logical flow, transitions. The text starts by addressing a controversy, then outlines the plan to examine Church documents. The structure is clear: introduction sets the stage, Chapter I dives into the Real Presence. Transitions between ideas are generally good, like moving from Scripture to Church teachings. However, there are abrupt shifts, such as the paragraph starting "The Articles.—There are seven Articles…" feels a bit sudden without a clearer link from the previous discussion. Also, some paragraphs are too long and dense, making it hard to distinguish between main points and supporting details. The author references different elements (Articles, Catechism) in a logical order, but the density of information might confuse readers. The main argument is clear, but the text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the doctrines, which could reduce coherence for unfamiliar readers.

Issues for fluency: Grammatical errors (subject-verb, tense), wordy sentences, archaic language. For coherence: Some abrupt transitions, overly dense paragraphs, assumptions of background knowledge.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while there are issues, it's still mostly readable. Coherence could be a 4 since the structure is logical but has some flaws in flow and clarity.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**  

### Issues Affecting Ratings:  

#### **Coherence (4/5)**  
- **Logical Structure**: The text is well-organized, with a clear introduction, stated objectives, and a systematic approach to addressing the topic (e.g., distinguishing between Scripture and Church documents).  
- **Transitions**: Mostly effective, though some paragraph openings (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles…") feel abrupt without smoother bridging.  
- **Assumptions**: Assumes familiarity with theological terms (e.g., "Real Presence," sacramental debates) and Church of England documents, which may confuse uninformed readers.  
- **Paragraph Density**: Overly long, dense paragraphs (e.g., the explanation of Reformation principles vs. Roman views) hinder clarity.  

#### **Fluency (3/5)**  
- **Grammar/Spelling**: Frequent errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were," "blinded give," "referred" inconsistency, missing articles).  
- **Sentence Complexity**: Excessively long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph contrasting Rome and England’s views) disrupt readability.  
- **Word Choice**: Archaic language ("thee," "was directed," "am examined") and redundant phrasing ("now that after three hundred years…").  
- **Redundancy**: Minor repetition (e.g., reiterating the importance of examining Church documents).  

Despite structural coherence, fluency is compromised by grammatical flaws and overly complex prose, while coherence suffers slightly from density and transitional gaps.
