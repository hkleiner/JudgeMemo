Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll take my time. The title mentions the Garden of Eden found in the American Northwest. The author is making a claim about locating Eden based on biblical descriptions and geographical features around the Mississippi River.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. As I read, I notice a lot of grammatical errors. For example, "had venture to published it" should be "ventured to publish." There are subject-verb agreements issues like "I is ignorant." Punctuation seems inconsistent, with missing commas or incorrect uses. Sentence structure is often convoluted. Some sentences are very long and hard to follow. Word choice is mostly formal but sometimes awkward, like "moral and intellectual growth" which is okay, but the overall flow is disrupted by errors.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about organization, logical flow, transitions, and consistency. The text jumps between different ideas—biblical references, personal discovery, geographical descriptions, and critiques of past explorers. Transitions between paragraphs aren't smooth. For example, moving from discussing the garden's location to criticizing the town's proprietors feels abrupt. The author assumes some background knowledge, like the significance of certain locations or names (e.g., "Havilah"), which might confuse readers. Despite the structure being somewhat chronological (discovery, explanation, description), the lack of clear linking between ideas disrupts coherence.

Issues affecting fluency: numerous grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, awkward phrasing, redundancy (repeating "our garden" frequently). For coherence: poor transitions, abrupt topic shifts, assumptions without explanation, and meandering descriptions that lack focus.

Scoring: Fluency is probably a 2 because the errors are frequent and hinder understanding. Coherence might be a 3 since there's some organization but significant disconnections and lack of clarity in presentation.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  

- **Coherence:**  
  - Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, geography, and social commentary (e.g., critiques of town proprietors).  
  - Assumptions of reader familiarity with terms like “Havilah” or biblical geography without explanation.  
  - Poor transitional phrases between paragraphs (e.g., “Now that we are up where we can see…” feels disconnected).  
  - Ideas (e.g., serpent symbolism, town development) are introduced without clear integration into the central argument.  

- **Fluency:**  
  - Frequent grammatical errors (e.g., “had venture to published,” “I is ignorant,” “woulded have been”).  
  - Awkward sentence structures (e.g., “It has appeared in brief articles… in order to invite general inspection”).  
  - Redundant phrasing (e.g., repetitive “our garden” without variation).  
  - Inconsistent punctuation (missing commas, incorrect dashes).  
  - Archaic or overly formal tone clashes with modern references (e.g., “electric towers”).  

**Rationale:**  
- **Coherence (3):** While the text loosely follows a narrative arc (discovery → explanation → description), its lack of clear transitions, uneven pacing, and tangential comments reduce coherence. The central argument about Eden’s location is intermittently clear but buried under meandering descriptions.  
- **Fluency (2):** The text is challenging to read due to pervasive grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of polish in sentence-level craftsmanship. While the vocabulary is largely correct, the writing lacks smoothness, forcing the reader to decipher intended meanings repeatedly.
