Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given text, which is a religious treatise from the Church of England. First, I need to read through the text carefully. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text is from an older time, so the language might be formal and somewhat archaic. I notice long, complex sentences. For example, the first paragraph has sentences that are quite lengthy and dense. The structure is logical, but the verbosity might make it hard to follow for modern readers. There are some awkward phrasings, like "the thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer..." which seems like a typo or mistranscription. Also, words like "wheresoever" and "wherein" are formal but might affect readability. Grammar and punctuation seem mostly correct, but the complexity of sentences could reduce fluency.

Now coherence: This is about how well ideas are organized and connected. The text is structured with chapters and clear headings, which is good. The author outlines the objective in the introduction and follows through. Each section builds on the previous, discussing the Real Presence, then moving to Church documents. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, like moving from Scripture discussion to the Church's teachings. However, there are abrupt shifts, such as the part where the text talks about the Church's current state without a clear connection to the preceding analysis. Also, some paragraphs are very long, which might disrupt the flow. The author refers to "us who cling to the great principles of the Reformation" without explanation, which could confuse readers not familiar with the context. 

Issues for fluency: Archaic vocabulary, overly complex sentences, possible typos (like "the of two perfectly the eating faith"), redundancy in some explanations. 

Issues for coherence: Some abrupt topic shifts, lack of clear transitions in a few places, assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., Reformation principles), and very long paragraphs that could be broken up for better flow.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while it's mostly grammatically correct, the complexity and archaic language hinder readability. Coherence could be a 4 since the structure is logical overall, but there are some disruptions and assumptions made about the reader's background.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**  

---

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**  

#### **Coherence (4/5)**  
- **Clear Structure**: The text is well-organized with chapters, headings, and a logical progression from introducing the topic to analyzing Church documents.  
- **Transitions**: Generally smooth between paragraphs, though minor abrupt shifts occur (e.g., the sudden mention of the Church’s "sifting time" without prior context).  
- **Assumed Knowledge**: Readers unfamiliar with theological debates (e.g., Reformation principles, specific Scripture references) may struggle with unexplained terms.  
- **Long Paragraphs**: Dense blocks of text (e.g., the explanation of sacramental views) could benefit from subdivision for clarity.  

#### **Fluency (3/5)**  
- **Archaisms/Vocabulary**: Formal, antiquated language (e.g., "wheresoever," "thou") and complex sentence structures reduce readability.  
- **Grammar/Punctuation**: Mostly error-free, but occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the of two perfectly the eating faith") suggests minor transcription errors.  
- **Redundancy**: Repetitive emphasis on distinguishing Church of England views from Rome (effective for clarity but slightly verbose).  
- **Sentence Complexity**: Frequent long, nested sentences (e.g., the opening paragraph) impede smooth flow.  

### **Rationale for Scores**  
- **Coherence (4)**: While the text is logically structured and ideas build coherently, minor disruptions and assumptions about the reader’s background prevent a perfect score.  
- **Fluency (3)**: Despite grammatical correctness, the text’s antiquated style, redundancy, and overly complex syntax make it challenging for modern readers to navigate.
