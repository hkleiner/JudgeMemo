Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on fluency and coherence, then give scores from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the entire story carefully. 

Starting with fluency: The text is from the 19th century, I think, because of the language and structure. Sentences are long and complex, which might make them hard to follow. There are some grammatical errors, like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "commencing" used incorrectly. Also, punctuation seems inconsistent—lots of commas without clear structure. Word choice is formal but sometimes awkward, like "veritable" and "euphony," which might be less common now. Some sentences are redundant or repetitive, like repeating the beauty of the location multiple times.

For coherence: The structure jumps around. The author starts with a discovery, then goes into biblical references, then describes the location in detail, and brings in snakes and the city. Transitions between paragraphs aren't smooth. For example, moving from discussing the garden's features to talking about rattlesnakes feels abrupt. The author assumes the reader knows some context, like the significance of certain place names or biblical references without explanation. There's a lot of repetition in emphasizing the garden's perfection without clear logical flow. Also, some parts are unclear, like the mixed-up sentences towards the end (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...") which seem like typos or jumbled text.

Issues with fluency include archaic language, grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and awkward phrasing. Coherence issues are poor transitions, repetition, assumptions without explanation, and some incoherent paragraphs.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 2 because while it's readable with effort, the errors and complexity hinder smoothness. Coherence could be 3 since the main idea is there, but the execution is disjointed and hard to follow at times.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  

### **Key Issues Affecting Ratings**  

#### **Coherence (3/5)**  
- **Abrupt Transitions**: Paragraphs shift abruptly between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, geographical description, and speculative claims (e.g., snakes in the garden appear out of context).  
- **Redundancy**: Repeated emphasis on the garden’s beauty and biblical alignment without progressive logic (e.g., "our garden is still in the right place" repeated in slightly varied forms).  
- **Assumptions**: Unexplained references (e.g., "the finger of time pointing to the North West," "Havilah") assume reader familiarity with obscure contexts.  
- **Structural Disorder**: The text conflates discovery narrative, scriptural analysis, and tourist-like descriptions without a clear thematic hierarchy.  
- **Unresolved Ideas**: Claims about the garden’s moral/intellectual suitability are asserted without evidence or connection to preceding ideas.  

#### **Fluency (2/5)**  
- **Archaisms & Complexity**: Overly formal, 19th-century syntax (e.g., "evidently must place him somewhere," "sensibly impressed by a suggestion") and excessively long sentences hinder readability.  
- **Grammatical/Punctuation Errors**: Typos ("antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions"), inconsistent commas, and run-on sentences (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...").  
- **Awkward Phrasing**: Redundant phrases ("being in the state of nature for the garden plow"), overly poetic language ("fenced or walled in by... variety of topping out"), and mixed metaphors ("wild scenery" vs. "profuse growth of timber").  
- **Clarity Gaps**: Jumbled passages (e.g., the incoherent block starting with "Nineteen been at lost a...") and unclear spatial descriptions (e.g., "three banks" of the river explained confusingly).  

### **Summary**  
The text struggles with **fluency** due to its antiquated style, errors, and cumbersome structure, making it laborious to parse. **Coherence** suffers from poor organization, repetition, and unguided shifts in focus, though the central claim (locating Eden) remains vaguely traceable throughout.
