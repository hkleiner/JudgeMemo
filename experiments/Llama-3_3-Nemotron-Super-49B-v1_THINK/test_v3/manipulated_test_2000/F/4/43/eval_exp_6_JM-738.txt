Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores with issues. 

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is "The Puzzle of Dickens’s Last Plot" by Andrew Lang. It's an analysis of Dickens' unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The structure has chapters like Introduction and Dramatis Personae, followed by The Story.

Starting with coherence. The text is well-organized, moving from introduction to character analysis to plot points. Each section transitions logically. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like jumping from discussing Dickens' health to analyzing specific characters without clear connectors. Also, the mix of historical context (Dickens' health, other authors) and plot summary might confuse some readers. The author assumes familiarity with Dickens' works and terms like "roman policier", which could disrupt coherence for less knowledgeable readers.

Now fluency. The language is formal, with complex sentences and old-fashioned vocabulary (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "gamin"). This might make readability challenging. There are some awkward phrasings, like "Except of rivals, road such later stories..." which seems like a typo or misplaced words. Grammar mostly holds, but punctuation could be clearer in long sentences. Word choice is mostly appropriate but archaic, affecting smoothness.

Issues for coherence: 
1. Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., health to character analysis).
2. Assumed knowledge of Dickens and literary terms.
3. Some sections feel like lists (e.g., character traits) without smooth integration.

Issues for fluency:
1. Complex, archaic language and sentence structures.
2. Typos or errors (e.g., "Except of rivals...").
3. Long, dense paragraphs without clear breaks.

Scores: Coherence might be a 4 because the overall structure is logical, but minor issues. Fluency a 3 due to readability challenges despite good grammar.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Scores:**  

### **Coherence (4/5)**  
1. **Logical Structure**: The text is well-organized, progressing from introduction to character analysis to plot exposition.  
2. **Minor Abrupt Shifts**: Transitions between historical context (e.g., Dickens’ health, literary influences) and plot details sometimes feel disconnected (e.g., jumping from Forster’s critique to *Edwin Drood*’s characters without explicit bridges).  
3. **Assumed Knowledge**: Readers unfamiliar with Dickens’ oeuvre, terms like “roman policier,” or Victorian literary references may struggle with contextual coherence.  
4. **Tight Thematic Focus**: Despite digressions (e.g., comparisons to Lord Lytton’s work), the central puzzle of *Edwin Drood* remains the narrative spine.  

### **Fluency (3/5)**  
1. **Formal, Archaisms-Rich Language**: Complex sentences and antiquated phrasing (e.g., “hab nab at a venture,” “gamin”) create readability barriers.  
2. **Typos/Errors**: Phrases like “Except of rivals, road such later stories” appear garbled, disrupting flow.  
3. **Paragraph Density**: Long, uninterrupted blocks of text overwhelm the reader, lacking modern line breaks or transitional cues.  
4. **Grammar/Punctuation**: Mostly sound, but overly nested clauses (e.g., “We may think that the mannerisms… are not in the author’s best vein of humour”) slow pacing.  

The coherence score reflects strong organizational logic, while fluency suffers from stylistic and technical flaws that impede smooth reading.
