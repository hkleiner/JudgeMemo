Okay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to carefully read both chapters of the story provided. The user wants me to assess fluency and coherence, each on a scale of 1 to 5. 

Starting with the first chapter, "AN INTRODUCTION." The text seems to be an introduction to Will Bradley's work. The writing style here is quite formal, almost like an academic or literary introduction. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect fluency. For example, the opening sentence is a bit convoluted: "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK. I agreed to write an introduction to Will Bradley, His Chap Book before I had seen the book’s text itself." The use of all caps for the title is jarring, but maybe that's intentional for emphasis. There's a shift in topic when it mentions Dickens's last plot, which feels abrupt. Wait, that part seems out of place. The author talks about Bradley's impact, then suddenly brings up William Archer and Dickens. That might disrupt coherence.

Moving to the second chapter, "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING." This appears to be a biographical sketch of Will Bradley's early life. The narrative jumps between different scenes of his childhood, using a lot of dialogue and descriptive passages. The structure here is more fragmented, with short paragraphs and abrupt transitions between events. For instance, the story shifts from graduation day to his father being ill, then to moving, and so on, without clear connectors. This could impact coherence. Also, there are some sentences that are simplistic, like "You are six years old; next month you will be seven." which contrasts with more detailed descriptions. The fluency might suffer here because of the choppy transitions and varying sentence complexity.

Now, evaluating coherence. The first chapter has a clearer structure, discussing Bradley's work and impact, but the sudden mention of Dickens and Archer disrupts the flow. The second chapter's biography is more disjointed, with events presented in a non-chronological or loosely connected manner. The lack of transitional phrases makes it hard to follow the narrative flow.

For fluency, the first chapter's complex sentences and some archaic language (e.g., "emancipation," "corn-fed American") might make it less readable. The second chapter has simpler sentences but the fragmented structure and lack of smooth transitions affect readability. There are also some unclear references, like the part about Sir Simon and the blood-stain, which seems unrelated and confusing.

Issues to note for coherence: abrupt topic shifts (Dickens in the introduction), unresolved references (Sir Simon's story), disjointed narrative in chapter 2. For fluency: complex sentence structures, archaic vocabulary, inconsistent sentence simplicity in chapter 2, and formatting issues like the all-caps title.

Scoring: Coherence might be a 3 because while each chapter has its logic, the shifts and unresolved parts detract. Fluency could be a 3 as well due to readability issues from sentence complexity and structure, despite some clear passages.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Scores:**  
- **Coherence:**  
  - Abrupt shift in "AN INTRODUCTION" from discussing Bradley to analyzing Dickens’s plot (unresolved connection).  
  - Fragmented, non-chronological structure in "THE BOY PRINTER" (e.g., jarring transitions between childhood scenes, unresolved tangent about Sir Simon’s death).  
  - Lack of transitional phrases to guide the reader through ideas or scenes.  

- **Fluency:**  
  - Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK...") and archaic vocabulary ("emancipation," "corn-fed American").  
  - Inconsistent tone: Formal, poetic language contrasts with simplistic, childlike narration in "THE BOY PRINTER."  
  - Formatting quirks (e.g., all-caps title, abrupt paragraph breaks without clear segmentation).  
  - Redundant or vague details (e.g., "the blood-stain... cannot be removed" with no context).  

**Rationale:**  
- **Coherence (3):** While each chapter broadly explores a coherent theme (Bradley’s impact / childhood biography), the narrative suffers from unresolved tangents and poor transitions, disrupting logical flow.  
- **Fluency (3):** The text is readable in isolated passages but hindered by uneven sentence complexity, archaic phrasing, and structural inconsistencies that interrupt smooth progression.
