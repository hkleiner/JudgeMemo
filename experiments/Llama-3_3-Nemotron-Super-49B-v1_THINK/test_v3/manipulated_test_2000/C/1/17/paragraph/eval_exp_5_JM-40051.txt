Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to assess the given story's fluency and coherence, then score them from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the story carefully. 

Looking at the text, the first thing that stands out is the structure. The story starts talking about the Garden of Eden, then suddenly shifts to a completely different narrative about Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin. Then there's a description of a landscape, followed by a scene with Mrs. Umney at Canterville Chase, then a part about a glass partition in an office, a mention of serpents being destroyed, another segment about George Stransom, and so on. These sections seem unrelated. That's a big coherence issue because the narrative jumps around without connections.

For fluency, the language is mostly formal and old-fashioned, which might make it less readable. There are long, complex sentences. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that's quite convoluted: "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The phrase "reasonable thing of it" is unclear. Also, there are typos like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring). 

In the Jasper/Rosa part, the writing style changes to a more modern, possibly excerpt from a different story. The transition is abrupt. Then the description of the Mississippi as the Euphrates tries to link geography to the Bible, but it feels forced. The part about Mrs. Umney seems like a snippet from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which is a different story entirely. The glass partition section might be from another work, like a mystery novel. The George Stransom part has a distinct literary style, possibly from Henry James. 

So, coherence is really bad because the text is a mashup of different stories without any logical flow or connection between paragraphs. The author jumps between topics like biblical geography, personal relationships, office settings, and philosophical reflections without transitions. 

Fluency issues include archaic language, grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent writing styles. The readability suffers because of long sentences and unclear references. For example, the sentence "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark,—densely covered with forest trees..." uses a complex structure and unclear terms like "three banks."

Also, some parts are redundant. The repeated emphasis on the garden's location without clear evidence disrupts flow. The mix of different narrative voices (formal essay, romantic drama, philosophical reflection) makes the text disjointed.

So, coherence score would be 1 because there's no logical connection between sections. Fluency might be 2 due to the errors, archaic language, and awkward structures, but some parts are clear when considered alone. However, overall, the fluency is poor because of the inconsistencies and obstacles to smooth reading.

FINAL Coherence Score: 1  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Affecting Scores:**  
- **Coherence:**  
  - **Abrupt Unconnected Sections:** The text jumps between biblical speculation, romantic drama, descriptive geography, office settings, and philosophical reflections without logical transitions or narrative threads.  
  - **Lack of Central Theme:** Topics (Garden of Eden, personal relationships, office glass partition, literary character analyses) are unrelated and lack cohesive progression.  
  - **Inconsistent Tone/Voice:** Shifts wildly from academic/formal to romantic to sarcastic to melancholic without justification.  
  - **Unresolved References:** Characters (Jasper, Rosa, George Stransom) and settings (Canterville Chase, Life Assurance Office) appear randomly and unresolved.  

- **Fluency:**  
  - **Archaisms/Complex Syntax:** Overly formal, outdated language (e.g., "antldiluvians," "pleasantry," "fiancée") and convoluted sentence structures hinder readability.  
  - **Grammatical/Spelling Errors:** Typos ("admirirg," "dimentions"), awkward phrasing ("reasonable thing of it"), and inconsistent punctuation.  
  - **Redundancy:** Repetitive defenses of the Garden of Eden claim without clarity.  
  - **Inconsistent Style:** Mix of poetic descriptions, dialogue snippets, and essayistic arguments disrupts flow.  

The text fails to maintain coherence due to its fragmented, unrelated content, while fluency suffers from antiquated language, errors, and disjointed structure.
