Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores with issues.

First, I need to read both chapters carefully. The story seems to be a biographical introduction and a chapter about Will Bradley's early life. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, etc. Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-constructed. There's varied sentence length, which is good. However, some sentences are quite long and complex, like the one starting "Across the Atlantic..." That might make them a bit hard to follow. Also, there's a mention of "The home assistant played ambient music." That seems out of place in a 19th-century context. Maybe a typo or anachronism. 

In the second chapter, there are a lot of specific details about the protagonist's childhood. The narrative jumps between different events—school, moving, jobs. While the details are vivid, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, moving from the school scene to the father's illness feels a bit abrupt. Also, some sentences are simple and direct, which is fine, but the constant switching between past and present tense in narration (e.g., "You are six years old") might cause slight confusion. 

Now coherence. Coherence is about logical flow and connections between ideas. The first chapter connects Bradley's work impact well, contrasting Europe and America. The structure is clear: introduction, his influence, his style. However, the second chapter has a lot of fragmented scenes. The story of the boy's life is told in vignettes without clear transitions. Events like the circus, the printing press wishes, and job changes happen quickly without much linking. Also, some parts feel like a list of events rather than a flowing narrative. For instance, the switch from being at home with his father to moving to Ishpeming lacks a smooth transition.

Issues to note for fluency: anachronistic term, long complex sentences, tense shifts. For coherence: abrupt scene changes, lack of transitional phrases, some disjointed paragraphs.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because despite some issues, it's mostly readable. Coherence maybe a 3 due to the disjointedness in the second chapter. Wait, but the first chapter's coherence is good. Overall, averaging both chapters, coherence might be a 3.5, but since scores are integers, maybe 3 or 4. Let me check again. The first chapter is coherent, the second less so. Since the user provided two chapters, the overall coherence is affected more by the second. So Coherence 3, Fluency 4.

Wait, the second chapter's coherence issues are significant with many abrupt shifts. So Coherence 3. Fluency has some flaws but overall manageable, so 4.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  
- **Coherence:**  
  - Abrupt scene transitions in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" (e.g., shifting between school, family struggles, and job sequences without clear bridges).  
  - Fragmented vignettes in the second chapter disrupt narrative flow (e.g., circus day, prayer for a printing press, arithmetic trouble).  
  - Anachronistic phrase ("The home assistant played ambient music") disrupts historical context.  
- **Fluency:**  
  - Occasionally overly complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "Across the Atlantic...").  
  - Present-tense narration in "The Boy Printer" ("You are six years old") creates slight disorientation.  
  - Minor redundancy ("enormously enriched our arts; and he smashed...").  

**Explanation:**  
- **Coherence (3):** While the first chapter logically explores Bradley’s impact, the second chapter’s episodic structure and lack of transitional cohesion weaken overall coherence.  
- **Fluency (4):** Strong sentence-level clarity and vivid imagery, but marred by occasional awkward phrasing, anachronisms, and tense shifts.
