Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully. It's about someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden near the Mississippi River. The text is quite long, so I'll have to parse through it step by step.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, etc. The first thing I notice is the writing style—it's archaic, maybe from the 19th century. Words like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians), "gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent," which has a comma splice. There are long, winding sentences that are hard to follow. For example, the second paragraph has a sentence that's really long and convoluted. Also, there are typos like "admirirg" instead of "admiring," and "scietist" instead of "scientist." Punctuation seems inconsistent, with missing commas or overly long sentences without clear breaks.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The author jumps between biblical references, personal anecdotes, geographical descriptions, and defensive statements about criticism. The structure isn't very logical. It starts with the discovery, then talks about the Bible, then location details, and suddenly mentions snakes and Christian settlement. Transitions between paragraphs feel abrupt. For example, after describing the garden's location, it shifts to talking about rattlesnakes without a clear link. Also, some points feel repetitive, like emphasizing the beauty and the comparison to the Euphrates.

Issues affecting fluency: archaic language, grammatical errors (typos, comma splices), overly complex sentences, redundancy in phrases. For coherence: lack of clear structure, abrupt transitions, unclear connections between ideas (like the snake part), and some tangents (like the city names' beauty).

Rating fluency: Maybe 2 or 3. It's readable with effort, but errors and style issues hinder smoothness. Coherence: Also 2 or 3. The main idea is there, but the execution is disorganized.

Wait, but the author does connect biblical descriptions with the location, so some coherence is present. However, the execution is poor. Maybe coherence is a 3 because the overall argument is somewhat followed, but poorly presented. Fluency is 2 due to more severe issues with sentence structure and errors.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  
- **Coherence:**  
  - Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions (e.g., sudden focus on rattlesnakes).  
  - Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs (e.g., jump from garden location to Christian settlement impacts).  
  - Repetitive emphasis on beauty without logical integration (e.g., naming "beauty and euphony" of city names).  
  - Tangents (e.g., criticism of Trempealeau’s proprietors) disrupt the central argument.  

- **Fluency:**  
  - Archaisms ("antldiluvians," "fended") and outdated phrasing hinder modern readability.  
  - Grammatical errors (typos: "admirirg," "scietist"; comma splices).  
  - Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., paragraphs exceeding 5 clauses without clear punctuation).  
  - Redundancy ("most beautiful," "veritable") and awkward phrasing ("being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in the world").
