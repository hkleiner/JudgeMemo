Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story's fluency and coherence based on the given definitions. First, I need to carefully read the text and note any issues.

Starting with fluency: The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. Sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I notice words like "wheresoever" and "thou" which are outdated. Grammar seems correct, but the structure is dense. There's some redundancy, like repeating "the Church of England" multiple times. Punctuation is mostly correct but could be improved for modern readers. 

For coherence: The structure is logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. Transitions between ideas are generally clear, but some paragraphs are very long, making the flow a bit disjointed. The author references specific Articles and Scriptures, which helps organization. However, there are abrupt shifts, like moving from discussing the Church's documents to expressing anxiety about the Church's state without a clear link. Also, some sentences are too long and convoluted, disrupting the logical flow.

Issues for fluency include archaic language, lengthy sentences, redundancy, and outdated terms. For coherence, the main issues are long paragraphs, abrupt topic shifts, and overly complex sentence structures.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while it's clear, the readability is hindered by complexity and outdated language. Coherence is a 4 since the structure is mostly logical but has some disruptions.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  

### **Coherence (4/5)**  
- **Logical Structure**: The text is well-organized, progressing from introduction to specific doctrinal analysis (e.g., referencing Articles and Scripture in a systematic way).  
- **Transitions**: Mostly clear, with phrases like “Now it would be strange indeed” and “In doing this, our first business is” guiding the reader.  
- **Abrupt Shifts**: Sudden transitions, such as the paragraph lamenting the Church’s state (“That dear old Church is at this present time...”) feels disconnected from the preceding scholarly analysis.  
- **Paragraph Length**: Extremely long paragraphs (e.g., the first paragraph of Chapter I) disrupt flow and make digestion of ideas challenging.  
- **Resolved References**: Allusions to “the stuff” (likely a typo for “Church”) and vague terms like “a thing” (in “three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing”) confuse clarity.  

### **Fluency (3/5)**  
- **Archaisms**: Outdated vocabulary (“thou,” “wheresoever,” “mercifully granted”) and formal tone (e.g., “IT is a very easy thing...”) hinder modern readability.  
- **Sentence Complexity**: Overly long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph beginning “The practical conclusion is the same...”) require re-reading.  
- **Redundancy**: Repetitive phrasing (“the Church of England” repeated without variation) and verbose explanations (e.g., defining “real objective presence” at length).  
- **Grammar/Punctuation**: Mostly correct, but commas and semicolons are overused, creating pauses that slow the pace.  
- **Word Choice**: Terms like “stuff” (likely “Church” or “doctrine”) and unclear abbreviations (e.g., “1 Cor. x. 16, 17” without context for non-specialists) cause confusion.  

### **Summary**  
Coherence is strong in structure but weakened by poor paragraph management and abrupt thematic shifts. Fluency suffers from antiquated style, redundancy, and overly complex sentence design, though grammar is largely intact.
