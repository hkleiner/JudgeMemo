Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores from 1 to 5 for each. First, I need to read the story carefully.

The text is a religious treatise from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. It's structured with chapters, starting with an introduction and then Chapter I on the Real Presence. The author is arguing against the Real Presence doctrine, citing Church documents like Articles and the Catechism.

Looking at fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text is written in a formal, somewhat archaic style (words like "whilst", "thou", "thee" aren't here but the structure is old). Sentences are long and complex, which might make readability harder for modern readers. However, the grammar and punctuation seem correct. There's some redundancy, like repeating the point about the Church's documents needing examination. The vocabulary is appropriate but dense, which could affect fluency for less knowledgeable readers.

For coherence: This is about organization, logical flow, transitions, and consistency. The text is well-structured with clear chapters and headings. The introduction sets up the problem, then each chapter tackles a point. Transitions between ideas are mostly smooth, though some paragraphs are quite long and dense. The author contrasts Roman Catholic views with the Church of England's, using Scriptural references and Church documents. However, the frequent shifts between Scripture interpretation, doctrinal explanation, and references to Church texts might cause some confusion without clear transitions. Also, some paragraphs have multiple ideas that could be separated for better clarity.

Issues affecting scores: For fluency, the main issues are long sentences, archaic tone, and some redundancy. For coherence, the long paragraphs, dense information, and occasional lack of clear transitions between complex ideas.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because while it's clear and grammatically correct, the complexity and length of sentences hinder smooth reading. Coherence could be a 4 as well since the structure is logical but the density and paragraph length affect flow.

Wait, but maybe coherence is stronger because the overall structure is clear, even if paragraphs are long. Alternatively, the lack of clear paragraph breaks in the provided text (since it's a block) might affect coherence. But the user provided the text with chapters and headings, so structure is good. Maybe coherence is 4, fluency 4. But let me check again.

Fluency: The text is well-written in terms of grammar, but the sentence complexity and formality might reduce fluency for some readers. So maybe 4.

Coherence: The argument is well-organized, but the detailed explanations and multiple references in single paragraphs could make it less coherent for those not familiar with the topic. So also 4.

Alternatively, if the audience is assumed to be knowledgeable, coherence might be higher. But since the author is explaining to possibly a general audience within the Church, maybe the coherence is good but not perfect due to paragraph length. So I think both scores are 4.

### **Key Issues Affecting Ratings**  

#### **Coherence (4/5)**  
- **Clear Structure**: The text is well-organized with explicit chapters and a logical progression (e.g., introducing the controversy, defining terms, citing authoritative documents).  
- **Transitions**: Ideas are generally connected, but long paragraphs (e.g., in Chapter I) overwhelm the reader with dense theological distinctions without clear subheadings or paragraph breaks.  
- **Consistency**: The author contrasts Roman Catholic and Reformation views effectively but occasionally shifts abruptly between Scriptural interpretation, doctrinal critique, and appeals to Church authority (e.g., jumping from 1 Cor. 10:16 to the Articles without a smooth bridge).  
- **Clarity of Purpose**: The central question ("Does the Church of England teach the Real Presence?") stays focused, but tangents (e.g., the Churchâ€™s "sifting time") slightly disrupt flow.  

#### **Fluency (4/5)**  
- **Grammar/Punctuation**: Error-free, with complex but correct sentence structures (e.g., "Now it would be strange indeed if...").  
- **Readability**: Hindered by overly long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph explaining "real objective presence" has multiple nested clauses).  
- **Word Choice**: Formal, archaic tone ("whilst," "thou" absent but implied in style) and theological jargon ("accidents of bread and wine") may alienate modern or non-specialist readers.  
- **Redundancy**: Repetitive emphasis on "authoritative documents" and the distinction between "sign" and "gift" slows pacing.
