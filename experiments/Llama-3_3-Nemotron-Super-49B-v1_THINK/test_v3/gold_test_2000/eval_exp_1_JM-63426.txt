Okay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to read through both chapters carefully and understand what the text is about. The story seems to be a biographical introduction to Will Bradley, focusing on his impact in American graphic arts and his early life as a boy printer in Ishpeming.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, and flow. The first chapter has some complex sentences, but they're mostly well-constructed. There's a good use of metaphors like "romped like a breeze" and "perennial springtime freshness," which adds to the readability. However, some sentences are a bit long and might cause a slight pause. For example, the part about European artists (Morris, Beardsley, Toulouse-Lautrec) is a long list but still clear. The transition between paragraphs seems logical, discussing Bradley's influence and then his unique American style.

In the second chapter, the narrative shifts to Bradley's childhood. The use of "You" as the narrative voice is engaging but might feel a bit disjointed in places. There are many specific details (suckling a picklelime, eating clam chowder) that create vivid imagery but could make the text feel a bit fragmented due to the numerous short scenes. Some sentences are simple, others more complex, which might affect flow. For example, the part about the father's advice and then immediately going to play feels a bit abrupt. Also, terms like "Gordon press" or "job printers" might require some background knowledge, potentially hindering readability for non-experts.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well ideas are organized and connected. The first chapter has a clear structure: introduction to Bradley's work, his impact, contrast with European influences, and his American style. The flow is logical, building from his general contribution to specific aspects of his work. The transition to discussing his retirement and legacy is smooth.

The second chapter tells a chronological story of Bradley's early life. Each paragraph moves through time (graduation, moving, starting work), which is clear. However, some scenes feel a bit disconnected. For instance, the switch from being at home with his father to suddenly being on a train to Boston could be smoother. Also, the inclusion of specific historical events (Theodore Roosevelt's libel case) adds context but might interrupt the narrative focus on Bradley's development. The chapter ends with his progression in the print shop, which ties back to his future career, so that's coherent.

Issues for fluency might include some lengthy sentences, occasional redundancy (like repeated mentions of his American spirit), and specialized terms. For coherence, the main issue is the abrupt scene changes in the second chapter and perhaps too many detailed anecdotes that don't always clearly build on each other. However, overall, both chapters are well-organized, and the ideas connect logically. The use of transitions and consistent narrative voice helps maintain coherence despite some jumps in the second chapter.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because while there are some complexities and minor disruptions, the text is generally smooth. Coherence could also be a 4 since the structure is mostly logical, but the second chapter has some slight disconnects between scenes.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  
- **Coherence:**  
  - The second chapter’s episodic structure (e.g., abrupt shifts from school to travel to job details) occasionally disrupts narrative flow.  
  - Some historical asides (e.g., Roosevelt libel trial) feel tangential to Bradley’s personal development.  
  - Transitions between childhood scenes could be smoother (e.g., father’s illness to moving to Boston).  
- **Fluency:**  
  - Occasionally dense, winding sentences (e.g., “Across the Atlantic…” paragraph).  
  - Specialized terms (e.g., “job printers,” “Gordon press”) may confuse non-experts.  
  - Repetitive emphasis on Bradley’s “American” spirit, while clear, slightly disrupts variety.  
  - Engaging vivid details (e.g., “picklelime,” clam chowder) sometimes overwhelm the broader narrative arc.  

**Overall:** The text excels in vivid imagery and thematic coherence but falters in minor pacing and sentence-level clarity issues.
