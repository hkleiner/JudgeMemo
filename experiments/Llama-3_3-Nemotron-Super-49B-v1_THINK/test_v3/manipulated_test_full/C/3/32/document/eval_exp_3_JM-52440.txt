Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text's fluency and coherence, then provide scores from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to read the story carefully. The text is a historical theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. It's quite dense with references to Articles, Catechism, Homilies, and historical context. 

For Fluency: I need to check sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and readability. The text is formal, with long sentences. Some sentences are very complex, like the one starting with "But those who are loyal..." which has multiple clauses. The vocabulary is archaic (e.g., "a thing" likely a typo for "the Church"), which might affect clarity. There are also some unclear references, like "a thing more or less upon the subject" which seems like a placeholder error. Grammar and punctuation seem mostly correct, but the archaic style and length of sentences could hinder smooth reading.

For Coherence: Organization, logical flow, transitions, and consistency. The text is structured with chapters and clear topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter addresses a point with references to Church documents. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing the Catechism to the Communion Service feels a bit abrupt without a clear connector. The author assumes the reader is familiar with the documents and historical context, which might make it less coherent for those unfamiliar. The repetition of points (e.g., emphasizing the Church's rejection of transubstantiation) helps reinforce the argument but might feel redundant.

Issues to note for Fluency: Archaisms, sentence complexity, typos/placeholders ("a thing"), redundancy in explanations. 

Issues for Coherence: Assumed knowledge, abrupt transitions between some sections, repetition, and lack of clear summaries between chapters.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while it's mostly grammatically correct, the style and errors impact readability. Coherence could be a 4 since the structure is logical but has some gaps in transitions and assumes background knowledge.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Scores:**  

- **Coherence:**  
  - The text is highly structured and logically organized around its three main themes (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), with clear references to authoritative documents.  
  - Transitions between paragraphs occasionally feel abrupt (e.g., shifting from the Catechism to the Communion Service without explicit bridging).  
  - Assumes deep prior knowledge of Church of England documents and historical context, potentially alienating unfamiliar readers.  
  - Repetition of core arguments (e.g., rejection of transubstantiation) strengthens emphasis but risks redundancy.  

- **Fluency:**  
  - Archaisms ("a thing," "stuff") and outdated phrasing (e.g., "sorely tried by internal difficulties") create barriers to modern readability.  
  - Extremely long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph beginning "But those who are loyal...") hinder smooth flow.  
  - Typos/placeholders ("a thing" instead of "Church") and redundant explanations (e.g., repeated critiques of "theological sophistry") detract from polish.  
  - Formal, theological jargon ("propitiatory sacrifice," "consubstantiation") requires specialized vocabulary knowledge.  

**Rationale for Scores:**  
- **Coherence (4):** Despite minor transitional gaps and assumed expertise, the text’s thematic focus and systematic use of evidence maintain strong logical coherence.  
- **Fluency (3):** While grammatically sound, the text’s antiquated style, complexity, and errors reduce its overall clarity and readability for non-specialist audiences.
