Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given story, which is a biography of Will Bradley. 

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, divided into chapters. The narrative jumps between different periods of Bradley's life, his career in printing and design, interactions with various figures, and his contributions to typography.

Starting with coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The story has clear chapter divisions, each focusing on a specific period or aspect of Bradley's life. However, the transitions between chapters might be abrupt. For example, moving from his early life in Ishpeming to his time in Chicago without a clear link. Also, there are abrupt shifts in narrative voice, like switching from first person to third person (e.g., "You are six years old" to "Will Bradley"). Some sections feel like separate memoirs stitched together, causing discontinuity. 

There's also a lot of specific historical and technical detail (like typesetting, presses, historical figures) that might make the flow dense for readers not familiar with the context. The chronology and afterword add structure but are separate from the main narrative, which might disrupt the flow for some readers.

Now, fluency. Fluency concerns clarity, readability, sentence structure, etc. The writing often uses complex sentences with multiple clauses, which can make reading slower. For example, the long sentence in "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION" about Bradley's impact. There's also archaic language ("stuff", "thing") which seems like placeholders or redactions, causing confusion. These missing terms disrupt the flow and make sentences unclear. 

Word choice is mostly formal and appropriate, but some phrases are overly poetic or melodramatic (e.g., "joy bells ringing"), which might not fit the biographical tone consistently. Grammar and punctuation seem mostly correct, but the redacted terms ("stuff", "thing") are a big issue, leading to awkward phrasing. 

Considering all this, coherence is affected by structural jumps and narrative inconsistencies, while fluency is impacted by redactions, complex sentences, and some tone inconsistencies. 

I need to list the specific issues for each dimension. For coherence: abrupt chapter transitions, inconsistent narrative voice, dense technical content, separate add-ons (chronology, afterword). For fluency: redacted terms, complex sentences, archaic language, some melodramatic tone.

Scoring: Coherence might be a 3 because while the chapters are themed, the overall flow is disrupted. Fluency is lower, maybe 2, because the redactions significantly hinder readability, despite good grammar otherwise.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**

### **Issues Affecting Scores**

#### **Coherence (3/5)**  
1. **Abrupt Transitions**: Chapters jump between life stages (e.g., childhood to Chicago) without transitional phrases or clear chronological bridges.  
2. **Inconsistent Narrative Voice**: Shifts between first-person ("you"), third-person ("Will Bradley"), and reflective narration disrupt continuity.  
3. **Dense Technical/Historical Context**: Overloaded with printing jargon (e.g., "Golding press," "Caslon roman") and historical references (e.g., Kelmscott Press) that assume prior knowledge.  
4. **Appendices (Chronology, Afterword)**: Feel tacked on, interrupting the narrative flow rather than integrating seamlessly.  

#### **Fluency (2/5)**  
1. **Redacted Terms ("stuff," "thing")**: Frequent placeholders obscure meaning, causing confusion (e.g., "a stuff and Fifty-ninth Street").  
2. **Complex, Winding Sentences**: Overly long constructions (e.g., the first paragraph of "AN INTRODUCTION") hinder readability.  
3. **Archaic/Melodramatic Tone**: Phrases like "joy bells ringing" and "heart-rending sobs" clash with the biographical tone.  
4. **Lack of Clarifying Context**: Assumes familiarity with figures (e.g., Irving Way, Richard Harding Davis) without introduction.

### **Rationale for Scores**  
- **Coherence (3)**: While chapters are thematically organized, the narrative suffers from structural gaps and inconsistent voice, making the story feel episodic rather than cohesive.  
- **Fluency (2)**: The text is frequently interrupted by redactions, archaic language, and overly complex syntax, significantly impairing smooth reading. Despite strong technical grammar, the obstacles outweigh the clarity.
