Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of the given text, which is a lengthy analysis of Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". 

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is quite dense, filled with literary critique, theories about the plot, and references to various characters and events. The structure is somewhat fragmented, with chapters like "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY" and discussions on different scholars' interpretations (Mr. Proctor, Mr. Cuming Walters). There are also sections with dialogue and speculative scenarios about how the unfinished novel might have concluded.

For Fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, etc. The text uses complex sentences, sometimes very long, which might make it hard to follow. There are numerous parenthetical comments and asides, like "(if the Glasgow letter be genuine)" or explanations in parentheses that break the flow. The vocabulary is formal and includes archaic terms ("thou", "thee", "whilst"), which might slow down reading. Also, there are abrupt shifts between discussing the story, analyzing character motivations, and presenting different theorists' views without clear transitions. Grammar and punctuation seem mostly correct, but the overall density and lack of clear paragraphing (in the provided text, though maybe in the original it's better) could hinder fluency.

For Coherence: Coherence is about how well ideas are organized and connected. The text jumps between explaining the plot, criticizing Forster's account, discussing character identities (like who Datchery might be), and presenting different theories. There's a lack of a clear linear progression; for example, the author moves from describing Jasper's actions to debating whether Edwin is alive, then to analyzing book covers and illustrations without smooth connections. The abundance of theories and counter-theories (Proctor vs. Walters) can confuse the reader unless they're well-signposted, which they aren't always. However, the text does stay focused on unraveling the mystery, so there's a central theme, but the execution is disjointed.

Issues to note for Fluency:
- Overly complex sentence structures.
- Frequent parenthetical remarks disrupting flow.
- Archaic language and formal tone that may not be universally clear.
- Lack of clear paragraph breaks in the provided version (assuming the original has them, but as given, it's a block).

Issues for Coherence:
- Non-linear presentation of theories without clear sectioning.
- Abrupt transitions between plot summary, character analysis, and theoretical debates.
- Over reliance on assuming reader familiarity with the novel and its critiques.
- Multiple unconnected points (e.g., the opium hag's identity speculation feels tangential).

Now, scoring. Fluency: The text is challenging due to complexity and style, but no major errors. Maybe a 3? Coherence: The structure is weak, with poor transitions and too many tangents, but it's focused on the mystery. Maybe a 2 or 3. But since the user provided a detailed analysis with clear (if complex) points, maybe Coherence is 3 because despite the jumps, it's all related to the central mystery. Fluency, despite being dense, is well-written in terms of grammar, so 3 as well? Or maybe Fluency 4 if the writing is strong despite complexity, but the readability suffers. Wait, the definitions say Fluency includes readability. Given the complexity and archaic terms, maybe Fluency is 3. Coherence, due to the disjointedness but central theme, also 3. But some might argue Coherence is lower. Let me check examples. If the text frequently loses the reader due to poor connections, Coherence could be 2. But the author does link ideas around solving the mystery, even if clumsily. So final scores: Coherence 3, Fluency 3.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Scores:**  

#### **Coherence (3/5)**  
1. **Non-Linear Structure**: The text jumps abruptly between plot summaries, character analyses, theoretical debates, and speculative scenarios without clear transitional markers.  
2. **Overlapping Theories**: Multiple interpretations (e.g., Mr. Proctor vs. Mr. Walters) are presented disjointedly, confusing the narrative flow.  
3. **Tangential Speculations**: Subplots (e.g., the opium hag’s backstory) feel loosely integrated into the central mystery.  
4. **Assumed Prior Knowledge**: Readers are expected to be familiar with *Edwin Drood*, Forster’s account, and 19th-century literary conventions.  

#### **Fluency (3/5)**  
1. **Complex Sentence Structures**: Frequent long, convoluted sentences hinder readability (e.g., the 5-sentence paragraph on Grewgious’s experiment).  
2.
