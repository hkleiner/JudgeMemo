Okay, so I need to evaluate this story based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. The story is about someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Midwest, specifically between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The author uses a lot of biblical references and geographical descriptions.

First, looking at fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with long, winding sentences. There are multiple clauses stacked together, which can make it hard to follow. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that starts with "It has appeared in brief articles..." which feels a bit disconnected. There are also some grammatical errors, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antideluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admiring". Punctuation seems mostly correct, but the long sentences might affect readability. The vocabulary is formal but sometimes uses outdated terms or overly complex phrases, which might hinder smooth reading.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The text jumps between different topics: the author's discovery, biblical interpretations, descriptions of the landscape, comparisons to other locations (like Yosemite), and even what seems like unrelated paragraphs about George Stransom and a commercial traveler. There's a section that talks about George Stransom's ghosts, which doesn't seem to relate to the Garden of Eden claim at all. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt; for example, after describing the garden, there's a sudden switch to a discussion about the author's past experiences with a church society. The author also includes quotes and references (like Dr. Warren and Moritz Engel) without clear integration into the main argument. The structure lacks a clear flow, making it hard to follow the author's points logically.

Issues affecting fluency: archaic language, long convoluted sentences, some grammatical errors, and word choice that's occasionally obscure. 

Issues affecting coherence: abrupt topic shifts, lack of clear transitions, unrelated paragraphs, poor organization, and failure to logically connect ideas.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while there are issues, the text is mostly understandable with effort. Coherence is worse, maybe a 2, due to the severe disorganization and lack of logical flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  

- **Coherence:**  
  - Abrupt, unconnected shifts between topics (e.g., George Stransom’s narrative, random dialogue snippets).  
  - Lack of logical transitions between paragraphs (e.g., biblical analysis jumps to dairy farming statistics).  
  - Poor organization: Ideas (e.g., geographical descriptions, debates with critics) are not structured coherently.  
  - Unresolved tangents (e.g., "The wide gulf between the tao and the rich man...") and unrelated references (e.g., Moritz Engel’s book).  
  - Failure to maintain a clear central argument despite repetitive "Come and see!" appeals.  

- **Fluency:**  
  - Overly complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere.").  
  - Grammatical/spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg").  
  - Redundant or awkward phrasing (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing").  
  - Word choice inconsistencies (formal vs. colloquial: "Goo' Tea Rose" amid biblical rhetoric).  
  - Readability hindered by lengthy, unbroken paragraphs.
