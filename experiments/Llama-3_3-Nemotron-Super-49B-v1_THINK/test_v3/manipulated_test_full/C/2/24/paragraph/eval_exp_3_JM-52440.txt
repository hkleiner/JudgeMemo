Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores for each and list the issues.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text is quite long and formal, written in an old style, maybe 19th century. The sentences are complex and long, which might make them hard to follow. I notice words like "whilst," "whereas," and phrases that are somewhat archaic. The structure is logical, with clear chapters and topics, but the language is dense. There might be some redundancy in explanations, like repeating the distinction between spiritual and material food. Grammar and punctuation seem correct, but the outdated vocabulary could affect readability.

Now coherence. Coherence is about how well ideas are organized and connected. The text has a clear structure: Introduction, chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice. Each chapter analyzes different aspects using Church documents. The author uses transitional phrases and references previous points. However, the depth of theological discussion might make the flow dense. Some paragraphs are very long, which could disrupt coherence. The author assumes prior knowledge of the topic, which might confuse less familiar readers. The use of quotes from documents supports the argument but adds complexity.

Issues for fluency: archaic language, long sentences, some redundancy. For coherence: assumption of background knowledge, lengthy paragraphs, complex theological concepts without explanation.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while it's well-structured, the language and sentence complexity hinder readability. Coherence could be a 4 since the structure is clear, but the depth and assumptions might make it less accessible.

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**

#### **Coherence (Score: 4)**  
1. **Clear Structure**: The text is highly organized, with logical chapters and explicit analysis of theological concepts (e.g., Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice).  
2. **Transitions and Signposting**: Transitional phrases (e.g., "Thus far," "Now it would be strange") and references to earlier arguments maintain flow.  
3. **Overreliance on Unexplained Assumptions**: Assumes deep familiarity with Reformation history, Anglican documents, and theological jargon (e.g., "transaccidentation," "consubstantiation"), potentially alienating non-specialist readers.  
4. **Lengthy Paragraphs**: Some paragraphs span multiple topics without clear breaks, overwhelming the reader (e.g., the critique of Dr. Pusey in Chapter II).  
5. **Tone Shifts**: Oscillates between academic analysis and emotive appeals (e.g., "Oh! how I pity laymen..."), slightly disrupting formal coherence.  

#### **Fluency (Score: 3)**  
1. **Archaisms and Formality**: Uses antiquated vocabulary ("whilst," "whereas," "verily") and sentence structures (e.g., "I am not now discussing..."), reducing modern readability.  
2. **Complex Sentence Construction**: Frequent embedding of clauses (e.g., "Now, there can be no doubt...") creates syntactic density.  
3. **Redundancy**: Reiterates distinctions (e.g., spiritual vs. material food) without significant added clarity.  
4. **Grammar/Punctuation**: No major errors, but excessive semicolons and parenthetical explanations disrupt rhythm.  
5. **Word Choice**: Overly abstract terms (e.g., "sacramental appointment," "invisibly to feed the soul") slow comprehension.

The text excels in logical organization and thematic coherence but struggles with accessibility due to its archaic tone and specialized assumptions. Fluency is compromised by outdated language and overly complex syntax, though grammar remains strong.
