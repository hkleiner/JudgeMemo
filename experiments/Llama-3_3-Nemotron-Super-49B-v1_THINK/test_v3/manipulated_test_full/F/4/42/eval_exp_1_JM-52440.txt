Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given text, which is a religious doctrinal discussion from the Church of England. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's quite lengthy, so I'll have to skim through the chapters and note the structure and arguments presented.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, etc. The text is written in a formal, somewhat archaic style (uses "whence," "thou," etc.), which might make it less readable for modern readers. The sentences are long and complex, often with multiple clauses. For example, the first chapter has sentences that stretch on for several lines, which can make following difficult. There are also some grammatical errors, like "we was" instead of "we were." Punctuation seems mostly correct but the complexity of sentences might hinder smooth reading.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well ideas are organized and connected. The text is structured into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author uses transitional phrases and references previous discussions, which helps flow. However, the depth of theological argumentation might make it hard for non-experts to follow. The author assumes prior knowledge of Church documents (Articles, Catechism) which could disrupt coherence for unfamiliar readers. There's a clear logical progression in each chapter, but the overall length and repetitive emphasis on certain points (like criticizing Real Presence) might cause some disjointedness.

Issues affecting fluency: archaic language, overly complex sentences, grammatical errors. For coherence: assumptions of prior knowledge, repetitive arguments, and dense theological jargon.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while it's mostly clear, the style and errors hinder readability. Coherence could be a 4 since the structure is logical but accessibility is limited.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**  

#### **Coherence (4/5)**  
1. **Clear Logical Structure**: The text is organized into thematic chapters (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) with a consistent method of analyzing Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy).  
2. **Transitions and Signposting**: The author previews objectives (e.g., “my object is to endeavour to ascertain…”) and connects ideas across sections (e.g., referencing the 28th Article in multiple chapters).  
3. **Repetitive Emphasis for Clarity**: Key points (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified) are reiterated to counter opposing views, aiding thematic coherence.  

**Weaknesses**:  
- **Assumes Prior Knowledge**: Readers unfamiliar with the Church of England’s documents or theological debates may struggle to follow nuanced arguments.  
- **Dense Theological Jargon**: Terms like “transubstantiation” and “consubstantiation” are not defined for non-specialists.  
- **Lengthy Paragraphs**: Some paragraphs span over 20 lines, overwhelming the reader and disrupting focus.  

#### **Fluency (3/5)**  
1. **Formal Consistency**: The archaic, rhetorical tone is maintained throughout, suitable for a theological treatise.  
2. **Grammar and Punctuation**: Mostly error-free, with occasional archaisms (e.g., “was” instead of “were”).  

**Weaknesses**:  
- **Overly Complex Sentences**: Frequent use of nested clauses (e.g., “Now it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly clear a general definition…”) hinders readability.  
- **Archaic Vocabulary**: Words/phrases like “whence,” “saith,” and “thou” create a barrier for modern readers.  
- **Redundancy**: Phrases like “I am not now discussing…” or “it is my conviction…” could be streamlined for efficiency.

### **Summary**  
The text excels in **coherence** due to its rigorous logical structure and systematic engagement with source materials, though it sacrifices accessibility for non-experts. **Fluency** is compromised by antiquated language, grammatical irregularities, and overly dense sentence construction, making it challenging for casual readers to navigate.
