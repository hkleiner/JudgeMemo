Okay, I need to evaluate the fluency and coherence of this story. Let me start by recalling the definitions. Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, and word choice. Coherence is how well ideas are organized and connected, logical flow, transitions, etc.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, divided into chapters. The writing style seems somewhat old-fashioned, which might be intentional given the historical context. 

Looking at fluency: There are long, complex sentences. For example, in the first chapter, sentences like "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." Wait, that part seems garbled. Maybe a typo or a formatting issue? The original text has some lines that are jumbled, like "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." That doesn't make sense. Could be a scanning error or missing punctuation. That would definitely affect fluency.

Other parts have clearer sentences, but the structure is often convoluted. For example, "You tell him about your father and that you are going back to Boston to study art. He suggests your stopping off in Chicago to see him. Says he can perhaps help you." These are simple, but sometimes the narrative jumps without clear transitions between paragraphs.

Coherence: The overall structure is chronological, which is good. Each chapter covers a different period in Bradley's life. However, within chapters, there are abrupt shifts. For instance, in "THE GAY NINETIES," there's a detailed description of the era, then suddenly a first-person narrative about visiting Scribner's. The transition feels abrupt. Also, some paragraphs mix historical context with personal events without smooth connections.

There are also inconsistencies in tense and person. Sometimes it's first-person ("You are six years old"), sometimes third-person ("Will Bradley"). This might confuse the reader.

Issues affecting fluency:
1. Scanning errors or typos causing garbled sentences.
2. Overly complex sentence structures.
3. Inconsistent narrative voice (first to third person).
4. Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs.

Issues affecting coherence:
1. Abrupt scene changes within chapters.
2. Mixing of historical description and personal narrative without clear links.
3. Inconsistent narrative perspective.
4. Some paragraphs feel like lists of events rather than a flowing narrative.

Now, scoring:

Fluency: The major issues are the garbled sentences (which might be technical errors) and complex structures. If those are corrected, the rest, while somewhat archaic, is readable. But as presented, those errors hurt. I'd give Fluency a 3.

Coherence: The structure is mostly logical chronologically, but within chapters, the shifts and inconsistent narrative voice disrupt coherence. So Coherence might be a 4, but the abrupt transitions and inconsistencies lower it. Maybe 3.5, but since we use integers, 3.

Wait, but the overall story is understandable, and the chapters follow a logical timeline. The main issues are within-chapter coherence. So maybe Coherence is 3, Fluency 3 as well because the errors are significant.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  
- **Fluency:**  
  1. **Garbled Sentences:** Errors like "It about state and it..." suggest scanning/typographical issues, severely disrupting readability.  
  2. **Complex Sentence Structure:** Overly long, convoluted sentences (e.g., Chapter: THE GAY NINETIES).  
  3. **Inconsistent Narrative Voice:** Shifts between first-person ("You") and third-person ("Will Bradley") confuse the narrative flow.  

- **Coherence:**  
  1. **Abrupt Transitions:** Sudden shifts between historical descriptions and personal anecdotes (e.g., "THE GAY NINETIES" chapter).  
  2. **Mixed Narrative Modes:** Historical context and biographical events are not seamlessly integrated.  
  3. **Tense Inconsistencies:** Unmarked shifts between past and present tense (e.g., "You are on your way" vs. "Will Bradley was").  
  4. **Lack of Transitional Phrases:** Paragraphs often lack connectors to guide the reader through time jumps or thematic changes.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Fluency (3):** While the textâ€™s antiquated tone is stylistic, the technical errors and sentence complexity hinder smooth reading.  
- **Coherence (3):** The chronological structure is clear, but internal chapter disorganization and narrative inconsistencies weaken logical
