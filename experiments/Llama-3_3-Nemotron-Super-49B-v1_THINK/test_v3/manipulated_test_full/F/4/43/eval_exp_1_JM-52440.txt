Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores with issues.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. It's quite dense with complex sentences and religious terminology. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, etc. The text has very long, convoluted sentences. For example, the first chapter has sentences that are multiple lines long, making them hard to follow. There's also a lot of repetition in points, like repeatedly referencing the Articles and Catechism. The vocabulary is formal and sometimes archaic ("thou," "thee"), which might affect modern readability. However, the grammar seems mostly correct, but the structure is overly complex.

Now coherence: This is about organization, logical flow, transitions. The text is divided into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the author jumps between different documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without clear transitions. There's a lot of back-and-forth between refuting opposing views and presenting their own, which can be confusing. The main point is clear—the Church of England doesn't teach Real Presence—but the supporting arguments are densely packed and not always clearly connected. Some paragraphs are too long and meander.

Issues for fluency: Complex sentence structures, archaic language, redundancy. For coherence: Poor transitions between sections, overly dense paragraphs, abrupt shifts in focus (like suddenly quoting Dr. Pusey without introduction).

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while it's understandable with effort, the readability is poor due to sentence length and vocabulary. Coherence could be a 4 because the overall structure exists, but the execution has flaws in transitions and paragraph management.

Wait, but the user's example had fluency 3 and coherence 4. Let me check again. The text is well-organized in chapters, but within chapters, the flow is poor. The author assumes a lot of prior knowledge, which might hinder coherence for some readers. Fluency is lower because of the writing style. Maybe coherence is 3 instead? Hmm. Need to balance.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**

### **Issues Affecting Ratings**  

#### **Coherence (3/5)**  
1. **Overly Dense Structure**: The text is divided into logical chapters, but individual sections lack clear transitions between ideas. For example, the shift from discussing the Articles to critiquing Dr. Pusey’s views feels abrupt.  
2. **Assumed Knowledge**: Heavy reliance on unexplained theological terms (e.g., "transaccidentation," "consubstantiation") and historical context (e.g., the Council of Trent, Smithfield fires) may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.  
3. **Redundancy**: Key points (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified) are repeated verbatim across chapters without added clarity.  
4. **Paragraph Length**: Extended, unbroken paragraphs (e.g., the critique of Dr. Pusey in Chapter III) hinder digestibility.  

#### **Fluency (2/5)**  
1. **Sentence Complexity**: Extremely long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the first sentence of Chapter I) impede readability.  
2. **Archaic Language**: Frequent use of antiquated vocabulary ("thou," "thee," "whilst") and phrasing ("I do verily believe") clashes with modern tone.  
3. **Lack of Concision**: Redundant phrases ("it is therefore clear that," "I venture to say") and repetitive examples (e.g., comparisons to Rome) slow the narrative.  
4. **Grammar/Clarity**: Minor errors (e.g., "they but is" in Chapter I) and ambiguous constructions (e.g., "the manner of the two are so far connected").  

### **Summary**  
The text is coherent at a macro level (logical chapter structure) but suffers from poor micro-level execution (awkward transitions, redundancy). Fluency is notably weaker due to archaic style, overly complex sentences, and lack of modern clarity. Readers must invest significant effort to follow the argument despite its clear thematic focus.
