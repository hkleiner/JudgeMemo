Okay, I need to evaluate the fluency and coherence of this story. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, the story is titled "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden" and it's written in a somewhat archaic style. The author is claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Northwest, specifically between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The text is quite lengthy, with detailed descriptions of the geography, rivers, and geological features, comparing them to biblical descriptions.

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text has long, complex sentences that might be hard to follow. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that's over 20 words without a clear structure. There are also archaic phrases like "whence" and "whereof," which might make it less readable for modern readers. I noticed some grammatical errors, like missing articles ("a" or "the") in places, and inconsistent verb tenses. The word choice is formal but sometimes overly elaborate, which could hinder smooth reading.

Now, coherence: Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The text jumps between different topics: the author's discovery, biblical references, geographical descriptions, responses to critics, and even some personal anecdotes. There's no clear structure; it feels more like a collection of notes than a coherent narrative. Transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, the author moves from describing the garden's location to discussing Dr. Warren's theory without a smooth connection. The author also repeats points, like the uniqueness of the garden and invitations to "come and see," which disrupts the flow.

Issues affecting fluency include complex sentences, archaic language, grammatical errors, and redundancy. For coherence, the main issues are lack of organization, abrupt transitions, repetitive claims, and tangential information.

Rating fluency: Despite the challenges, the text is mostly understandable, but the readability is poor due to sentence structure and language. I'd give it a 3.

Coherence: The lack of clear structure and abrupt shifts make it hard to follow the author's argument. However, the core claim is repeated, so there's some thematic coherence. Maybe a 2 or 3. Since the organization is very weak but the main idea is consistent, I'll go with 2.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Ratings:**  

- **Fluency:**  
  - **Overly complex, winding sentences** (e.g., "When God formed the earth...") hinder readability.  
  - **Archaic vocabulary** ("whence," "antideluvians," "muff") and formal tone create distance for modern readers.  
  - **Grammatical inconsistencies** (e.g., missing articles, tense shifts).  
  - **Redundancy** (repeated invitations to "come and see").  

- **Coherence:**  
  - **Lack of clear structure**: Topics (discovery, biblical analysis, geography, debates) are poorly sequenced.  
  - **Abrupt transitions** (e.g., shifting from Dr. Warrenâ€™s critique to dairy statistics without connection).  
  - **Repetitive, unproven claims** (e.g., "we have the Garden") without logical buildup.  
  - **Tangential details** (e.g., mound-builders, personal anecdotes) disrupt focus.  

While the text conveys a fervent, consistent thesis, its execution suffers from disorganization and stylistic barriers. Fluency is compromised by antiquated language and poor sentence craft, but the core message remains decipherable. Coherence fails due to lack of logical flow and excessive tangents.
