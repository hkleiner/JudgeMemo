Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the style. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. Fluency is about how smoothly it reads, grammar, syntax, etc. I notice that the sentences are very long and complex. For example, the first paragraph has sentences that are multiple clauses long. That might make it hard to follow, but the structure is correct. There's no obvious grammar or spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is rich but appropriate. So maybe the main fluency issue is the complexity of sentence structure leading to slightly awkward phrasing for modern readers. But since the text is old, maybe that's expected. Still, according to the scale, if the issues are minor and don't disrupt readability much, it might score high. 

Now Coherence. The text is structured with chapters and clear topics. The introduction sets up the problem, then each chapter tackles a point. The author transitions between ideas logically, like moving from Scripture to Church documents. However, there's some repetition, especially in explaining the Reformation principles versus the Real Presence doctrine. The paragraphs are long, which might make it hard to see the structure, but the logic holds. The main issue might be the density of the content and the assumption of prior knowledge about theological terms, which could confuse some readers. But overall, the coherence is strong because the author outlines their approach and follows through systematically.

For Fluency score: The text is mostly fluent despite complex sentences. Maybe a 4 because while it's well-structured, the long sentences might cause some pauses. 

For Coherence score: Highly coherent with a clear structure and logical progression. Maybe a 5, but if there are minor disconnects or assumptions that might trip up readers, perhaps 4.5. But given the clear outline and step-by-step argument, probably 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentence structures may impede smooth readability. - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and formal tone (e.g., "whomsoever," "visibly signed and sealed") could challenge modern readers.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Dense, lengthy paragraphs obscure topic transitions. - [CLARITY] Assumes theological background knowledge (e.g., "the great principles of the Reformation").  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
