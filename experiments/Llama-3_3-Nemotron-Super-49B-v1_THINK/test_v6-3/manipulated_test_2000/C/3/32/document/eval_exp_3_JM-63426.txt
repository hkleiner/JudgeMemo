Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the text's fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. First, I need to read through both chapters carefully.

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some issues. I noticed a lot of instances where "a thing" is used instead of a specific noun. For example, "a thing, Massachusetts" or "across the thing, the Nineteenth Century". That's probably a placeholder or error, which affects clarity and fluency. Also, in the second chapter, there are missing nouns replaced with "a thing" repeatedly. That's a syntax and grammar problem because it disrupts the flow. The writing is generally smooth otherwise, with good phrasing, but these errors are noticeable.

For coherence, the structure seems logical. The first chapter introduces Will Bradley's impact, and the second chapter tells his childhood story. However, the transition between chapters might be abrupt without a clear link. Also, in the second chapter, the narrative jumps between different events in Bradley's childhood without smooth transitions. For example, moving from school to living with his uncle to working at the print shop feels a bit disjointed. There's also some repetition, like mentioning his desire to be an artist multiple times without adding new info. The overall story is understandable, but these transitions could be better.

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, despite the "a thing" errors, the text is mostly readable. The mistakes are minor but frequent, so maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally fluent but with notable issues.

Coherence: The structure is mostly there, but the transitions and some repetitions deduct points. Maybe a 3? It's generally coherent but has noticeable issues affecting the flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Repeated use of placeholder "a thing" instead of specific nouns (e.g., "a thing, Massachusetts", "across the thing, the Nineteenth Century"), disrupting clarity.  
- [LEXICON] Overly simplistic vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "lusty, democratic ambition", "giant’s spirit").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift between chapters without explicit narrative link.  
- [STRUCTURE] Unresolved repetition of themes (e.g., Bradley’s artistic ambition, debt owed to him) without added depth.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous timeline in Chapter 2 (e.g., unclear transitions between childhood events).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
