Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully and assess both Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems to be a mix of different writing styles and possibly different sources. The first part mentions Jasper, Sapsea, and Durdles, which sounds like a narrative, maybe from Dickens (Great Expectations?). Then there's a theological discussion about the Real Presence, which is formal and dense. Later, there's a passage about a ghost story (maybe Oscar Wilde's The Canterville Ghost) and another about George Stransom, which could be from James's "The Altar of the Dead".

Fluency issues might arise from the juxtaposition of these different styles. The theological section has complex sentences and theological jargon, which could make it less fluent for some readers. However, within each section, the grammar and syntax seem mostly correct. I notice some long, convoluted sentences in the doctrine part, which might interrupt flow. Also, transitions between the different chapters or sections might be abrupt, affecting coherence.

For Coherence, the big problem is the abrupt shifts between entirely different topics and styles. The text jumps from a narrative scene to a religious treatise to a ghost story to a character reflection without any connection. Each part on its own might be coherent, but together they're disjointed. There's no logical sequence or transition between these segments, making the overall text incoherent.

So, for Fluency, the main issues are complex sentence structures and possible minor grammar/spelling issues, but overall it's readable. For Coherence, the lack of connection between sections is the major problem.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in theological discussions (e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms ("whilst," "verily") and formal jargon ("consecrated elements") may disrupt modern readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected shifts between narrative fragments (e.g., ghost story, character introspection) and theological analysis.  
- [LOGIC] No thematic or contextual link between disparate sections (e.g., "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION" to "CHAPTER I" to unrelated vignettes).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
