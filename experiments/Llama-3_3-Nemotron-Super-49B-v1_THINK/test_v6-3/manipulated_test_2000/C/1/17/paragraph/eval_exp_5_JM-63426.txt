Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. For Fluency, I'm looking at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Coherence is about how the ideas flow logically and connect throughout the text.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written. I didn't notice any major grammar or spelling errors. The sentences are structured correctly, and the language flows smoothly. However, there are some long, complex sentences that might make reading a bit challenging. For example, the paragraph about Stransom and Creston has a lot of clauses, which could disrupt the flow slightly. But overall, these are minor issues. So Fluency score would be high, maybe 4.5 because while there are no errors, the complexity might affect readability a little.

Now Coherence. The text seems to have two distinct parts: the introduction about Will Bradley and then a chapter about "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming". The introduction connects well, discussing Bradley's impact. Then there's a sudden shift to a completely different narrative style in the second chapter, which appears to be a biographical sketch of someone else, possibly Bradley's early life. The problem here is the abrupt transition between the two chapters without clear connection. The first part talks about Bradley's artistic influence, and the second part is a detailed, anecdotal childhood story. There's no explicit link explained, which might confuse the reader. The coherence within each section is good, but the overall structure lacks a smooth transition between the chapters. So Coherence score would be around 3.5 because while each part is coherent on its own, the jump between them is noticeable and disrupts the flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, multi-clausal sentences may impede smooth reading flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unexplained transition between introductory analysis and biographical narrative in "The Boy Printer" chapter.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
