Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. The text is a religious treatise from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The author is analyzing whether the Church teaches the Real Presence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in a somewhat archaic style (uses "IT" capitalized at the start of sentences, which might be a typesetting artifact but is consistent). Grammar and syntax seem mostly correct. There are long, complex sentences, which might affect readability but aren't errors. I notice a couple of possible minor issues: "before men they are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs" â€“ the structure is a bit awkward but not wrong. Also, phrases like "if it please God" are archaic but intentional. No obvious spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate. So Fluency is high, maybe 5, but the complexity of sentences might make it a 4.5. Wait, the scale says 5 is "highly fluent with minimal errors". Since the sentences are complex but correct, maybe 5.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear: Introduction outlines the problem, then Chapter I dives into the Real Presence. The author sets up the debate, references Scripture, contrasts Roman Catholic and Church of England views, then moves to examine the Church's documents (Articles, etc.). Transitions between ideas are logical. However, the text assumes a lot of background knowledge about theological terms and Church documents, which might make it less clear to non-experts. But within its context, it's coherent. The only possible issue is the depth of assumptions, but the author is methodical. So Coherence is likely a 5, as the progression is clear and well-connected.

Wait, but the user instructions say to detect problems. For Fluency, maybe the archaic style could be seen as slightly less fluent for modern readers, but the scale doesn't mention style preferences, just errors. So Fluency is 5. For Coherence, the text is well-structured, so 5. But let me check again. Are there any abrupt jumps? The transition from discussing Scripture to moving into Church documents is smooth. The author announces each step. So yes, both scores are 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentence structures may impede readability for some readers.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Assumes significant background knowledge of theological terminology and Church of England documents, potentially limiting clarity for non-specialists.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 5
