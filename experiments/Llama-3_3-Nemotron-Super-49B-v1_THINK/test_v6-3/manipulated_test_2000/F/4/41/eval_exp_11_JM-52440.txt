Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The user wants me to check for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious errors. 

Looking at the text, there are several typos. For example, "best-establisjed" should be "best-established", "unvommon" instead of "uncommon", "as ifmthey" missing a space, "groundworknof" should be "groundwork of", "srrvice" is "service", "businessbis" is "business is", "tue" instead of "the", "RealnPresence" has an 'n' that shouldn't be there, "prssent" is "present", "wnd" should be "and", "vter" is probably "veto" but maybe a typo, "invisibly bestows the invisible gift on tye" should be "the". These are clear spelling mistakes.

Then, there's syntax and grammar. Phrases like "it is not at all an unvommon thing to hear it asserted" might be a bit awkward but not major. However, some sentences are quite long and complex, which could affect fluency. For example, the sentence starting "Now kt would be strange indeed..." has a typo ("kt" instead of "It") and the structure is a bit convoluted. Also, repeated phrases like "in the soul" multiple times might make the text a bit repetitive in wording.

For coherence, the text is well-structured with clear chapters and topics. The author transitions between ideas logically, discussing the doctrine, then moving to Scripture, and analyzing Church documents. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like shifting from discussing the Reformation principles to talking about the Church of England's state without a clear connector. Also, the paragraph about the Church's situation feels a bit out of place in the otherwise focused doctrinal analysis. Some sections repeat similar points, like the distinction between material and spiritual food, which might make the text slightly less cohesive.

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, despite the typos and some awkward phrasing, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much, so maybe a 4. For coherence, the structure is good, but there are some minor disconnects and repetitions, so a 4 as well.
