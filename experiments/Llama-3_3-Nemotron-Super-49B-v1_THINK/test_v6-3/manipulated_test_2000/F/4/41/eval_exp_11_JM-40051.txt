Okay, let me start by reading through the text carefully to evaluate both fluency and coherence.

First, for fluency. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. I notice several spelling errors like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "locayion" (location), "princopak" (principal), "admirirg" (admiring), "plafe" (place), "scwttered" (scattered), "jt" (it), "endkess" (endless), "jageed" (jagged), etc. These typos could disrupt the flow. Also, there are grammatical issues, such as "have ventured to publish it" which is correct but sounds a bit formal. The sentence structure is often complex and long, which might make it hard to follow. For example, "When God made man..." is a very long sentence. Punctuation seems mostly correct but could be improved for clarity. Word choice is mostly appropriate but sometimes awkward, like "sensibly impressed by a suggestion."

Now, coherence. The text jumps between biblical references and geographical descriptions. The author starts with a discovery claim, then discusses biblical context, then shifts to the location in the US. Transitions between these sections could be smoother. There's some repetition, like mentioning the beauty of the location multiple times. The structure is mostly logical, but the abrupt shift from scripture to describing Trempealeau might confuse readers. The author assumes some prior knowledge about the biblical Garden of Eden's description and the locations mentioned. Also, the part about snakes feels a bit tacked on without clear connection to the main point.

For fluency score: Despite the errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? Because while there are multiple issues, the overall structure is understandable.

For coherence score: The text has some logical flow issues and abrupt transitions, but the main narrative about identifying the Garden of Eden location is clear. Some parts feel disconnected, but it's generally followable. Maybe a 3? Because there are noticeable problems but not severe enough to make it hard to understand overall.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "locayion," "admirirg," "scwttered").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, fragmented sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thoroughly satisfied," "fancied").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between biblical analysis and geographic descriptions.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear links between paragraphs (e.g., snakes in "Hanging Garden" section).  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with biblical geography and regional details.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
