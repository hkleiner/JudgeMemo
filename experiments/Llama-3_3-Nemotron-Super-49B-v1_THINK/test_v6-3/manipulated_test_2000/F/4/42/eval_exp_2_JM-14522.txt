Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues with fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which I recognize as a classic. However, the version provided has numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." There are subject-verb agreement issues like "Mr. Otis have telegraphed" instead of "had telegraphed." Also, inconsistent verb tenses, such as "was frightened into a fit... from which she never really recover" (should be "recovered"). Spelling isn't a big issue here, but syntax and grammar are problematic. Despite these, the text is mostly readable, so the fluency score might be around 3 or 3.5 because while there are multiple errors, they don't make it completely unintelligible.

Now for coherence. The story structure seems logical, moving from the introduction of the characters to their experiences with the ghost. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like the shift from the family's conversation topics to the ghost's appearance without clear connection. Also, the dialogue sometimes feels a bit disjointed, and the humor might not land as intended due to the errors. But overall, the narrative progresses coherently. Maybe a coherence score of 4 because the main points connect, but there are minor disruptions.

Wait, but the errors in fluency could affect coherence. For example, incorrect verb forms might confuse the timeline. But the overall story flow is still understandable. So coherence might be 4, fluency 3.5. Let me check the scales again. Fluency 3 is "generally readable with multiple issues," which fits. Coherence 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," which also fits. Yeah, that makes sense.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "Mr. Otis have telegraphed," "the library have been lock up").  
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "she never really recover," "it was removed at once").  
- [LEXICON] Misused phrases (e.g., "we'dded have it," "woulded did it").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor abrupt transitions (e.g., shift from dinner conversation to ghost appearance without clear link).  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive descriptions of the stain removal (could be streamlined).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
