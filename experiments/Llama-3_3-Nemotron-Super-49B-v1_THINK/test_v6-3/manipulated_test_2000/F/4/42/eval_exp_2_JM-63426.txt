Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through both chapters carefully to spot any fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some grammatical errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "It should be talked about." Also, "realized" should be "realize." In the second chapter, there are tense inconsistencies, like "was" used incorrectly instead of "were" in several places. Words like "was" instead of "were," "don’t worked" instead of "didn’t work," and "smell" missing in "the smell of salt and sand." These are clear grammar and spelling mistakes. The structure of sentences is generally good, but some are a bit long and could be clearer. However, the errors, though present, don't make the text unreadable. So Fluency would be a 4, maybe 4.5, but the errors bring it down a bit.

Now Coherence. The narrative flows well overall. The first chapter connects Bradley's impact on his time, and the second chapter tells a coherent childhood story. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like jumping from Bradley's career to his retirement without a clear link. In the second chapter, scenes like the circus day or the printing press details might feel a bit disconnected if not for the overall developmental narrative. The structure is mostly logical, but some parts could be smoother. So Coherence is probably a 4, as the main points connect but with minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It shoulded be talked about" (should be "should be")  
- [SPELLING] "realized" (should be "realize")  
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple incorrect uses of "was" instead of "were" (e.g., "children was")  
- [SPELLING] "don’t worked" (should be "didn’t work")  
- [LEXICON] Missing word ("smell of salt and sand" lacks "smell")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Bradley’s career peak to retirement  
- [TRANSITION] Minor disjointedness in childhood anecdotes (e.g., circus day feels slightly tangential)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
