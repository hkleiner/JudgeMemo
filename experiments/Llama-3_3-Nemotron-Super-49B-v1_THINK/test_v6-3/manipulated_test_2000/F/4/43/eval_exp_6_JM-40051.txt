Okay, let me tackle this evaluation step by step. The user wants me to assess the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

First, Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. I notice a few grammatical errors, like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring). There are also some awkward phrasings, such as "Nineteen been at lost a..." which seems like a typo or jumbled sentence. Spelling mistakes like "commisitutes" (constitutes) and "Bridtish" (British) are present. The syntax is mostly okay but sometimes convoluted, making it a bit hard to follow. Despite these, the text is generally readable, so Fluency is probably a 4, maybe 3.5 because the errors, though minor, are noticeable.

Now Coherence. The structure is logical overall, starting with the discovery claim, biblical references, and then the location description. However, there are abrupt transitions, like jumping from discussing the garden's features to talking about snakes without a clear link. Some parts repeat ideas, like emphasizing the garden's beauty multiple times. The flow is mostly maintained, but the shifts between topics can be confusing. Also, the section with garbled text ("Nineteen been at lost a...") disrupts coherence. So Coherence might be a 4, since the main points connect but there are some weak links and repetitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "Bridtish", "commisitutes").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...").  
- [GRAMMAR] Rare but noticeable grammatical slips (e.g., "have been opening to the minds", inconsistent verb tenses).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., snakes introduced without clear connection to prior context).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on beauty without tight logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] Localized incoherence in garbled passages (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
