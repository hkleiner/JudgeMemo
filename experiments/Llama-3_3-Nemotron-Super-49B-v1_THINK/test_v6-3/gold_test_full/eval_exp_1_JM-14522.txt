Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as per the instructions. 

Starting with Fluency: It's about how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The sample text is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which I recognize as a classic. Given its age, the language might be somewhat archaic but still fluent. I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Reading through the text, the sentences are complex but well-structured. There's a lot of dialogue with distinct character voices, especially the Americans vs. the ghost. The vocabulary is rich and appropriate for the period. I notice some long, winding sentences, but they seem intentional for comedic effect or to mimic Victorian style. No obvious grammar or spelling mistakes jump out, considering it's a published work. So Fluency is likely high, maybe a 5, but I should check if the archaic language affects readability. Since it's a known work and the language, though old, is clear, Fluency score is probably 5.

Now Coherence: How the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, no ambiguities. The narrative has chapters, each advancing the plot. The ghost's attempts to scare the family, their reactions, and the final resolution with Virginia. The story progresses logically from the introduction of the ghost to the family's interactions and the emotional conclusion. There's a clear structure: setup, conflict, climax (Virginia's encounter), resolution (ghost's death, funeral). Transitions between chapters are smooth. The only potential issue might be the length of some chapters or the ghost's lengthy monologues, but they serve the comedic and character development purposes. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistently woven throughout. So Coherence is also high, likely a 5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any abrupt shifts or unclear parts? The shift from comedic scenes to Virginia's serious conversation with the ghost might be a point, but it's handled well with her character development. The prophecy's fulfillment with the almond tree blossoming ties things up neatly. No major coherence issues detected. 

So final scores: Fluency 5, Coherence 5. But wait, the instructions mention using half-points if necessary. Given that the text is from the 19th century, some readers might find the language slightly less fluent due to archaisms, but since it's a classic and the flow is maintained, it's still a 5. Coherence is tightly structured, so 5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "gipsies," "gamboge") may slightly impede modern readability.  
   - [SYNTAX] Rarely, overly elaborate sentence structures (e.g., Chapter V’s descriptive paragraphs) require close attention.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor thematic shift between comedic ghost antics and Virginia’s emotional arc, but well-integrated.  
   - [CLARITY] One ambiguous transition (Virginia’s disappearance resolved abruptly in Chapter VI).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*Both Fluency and Coherence scores are maximal (5) due to the text’s masterful, era-appropriate language, logical narrative flow, and thematic cohesion, despite minor stylistic demands on modern readers.*
