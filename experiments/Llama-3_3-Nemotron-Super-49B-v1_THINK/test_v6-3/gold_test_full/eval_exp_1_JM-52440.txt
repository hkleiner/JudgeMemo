Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a historical theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The text is quite formal and dense, with complex sentences and religious terminology.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability, but they're correctly formed. There's some archaic language ("IT is a very easy thing...") which might make it less fluent for modern readers, but it's consistent with the historical context. I didn't notice any major grammatical errors. So Fluency score is likely high, maybe 4 or 4.5. The only deduction is for the overly complex sentences and some outdated phrasing.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about logical flow, transitions, and overall structure. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author builds a clear argument, referencing Church documents systematically. Transitions between ideas are smooth, like moving from Articles to Catechism to Homilies. However, the text is very detailed and assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and historical context, which might make it hard for some readers to follow. But within its target audience, the structure is logical. So Coherence score is also high, maybe 4.5. The main issue is the density and specialized knowledge required.

Finalizing scores: Fluency 4.5 (minor issues with complexity and archaism), Coherence 4.5 (well-structured but dense). No major problems in either metric.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [COMPLEXITY] Overly complex sentence structures and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing...") may impede modern readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [SPECIALIZED ASSUMPTIONS] Assumes deep prior knowledge of theological history and terminology (e.g., "transaccidentation," "Reformation principles").  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
