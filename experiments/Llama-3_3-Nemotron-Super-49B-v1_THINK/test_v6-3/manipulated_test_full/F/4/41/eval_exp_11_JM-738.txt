Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided scales. The text is an analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is quite long and dense. I notice some archaic language and complex sentences, which might affect readability. For example, phrases like "unaccountable expedition" or "fancied" might be less common today. There are also long paragraphs without clear breaks, which could make it harder to follow. However, the structure within each chapter seems logical. Are there any grammatical errors? Scanning through, I see "unlooked-for sallies" which is correct but formal. Maybe some missing articles or slight punctuation issues, but overall, the grammar seems okay. The vocabulary is rich but might require some effort for modern readers. So, Fluency score might be around 4, considering it's mostly fluent but with some challenges due to style and length.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow, structure, and how ideas connect. The text has a clear introduction, chapters, and a conclusion. Each part builds on the previous, analyzing the plot and presenting theories. However, the discussion jumps between different theories (Proctor, Walters, Lang's own) which might confuse readers without prior knowledge. The transitions between sections could be smoother. For example, moving from describing characters to analyzing Datchery's identity feels a bit abrupt. Also, the inclusion of Forster's evidence and Collins's drawings adds complexity. Despite this, the overall argument is structured, even if dense. Coherence score might be 3.5, as it's generally coherent but with some disjointedness and assumed background knowledge.

Wait, but the Coherence scale says 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable abrupt shifts." The text does have shifts, especially when introducing new theories without clear connections. So maybe 3.5 is right. For Fluency, despite some complexity, it's well-structured with minimal errors, so 4.

Double-checking the criteria: Fluency 4 is "mostly fluent... minor issues." The text's main issue is complexity and some outdated language, but no major errors. Coherence 3.5 fits "generally coherent... noticeable shifts." Yes. So final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and complex sentence structures may impede readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between analytical sections and theories; assumes prior knowledge of the novel.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
