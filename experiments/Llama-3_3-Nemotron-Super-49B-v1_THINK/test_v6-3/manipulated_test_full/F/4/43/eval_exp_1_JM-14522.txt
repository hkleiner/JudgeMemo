Okay, I need to evaluate the text based on Fluency and Coherence. Let's start with Fluency. The text is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which I know is a classic, so I expect good writing. But I have to check for any issues.

Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Scanning through, the text uses complex sentences but they seem structured. I notice some archaic language like "thou" and old spellings, but that's intentional for the period. Are there any actual errors? The example given in the problem had a jumbled sentence ("fear smiling ghost have Canterville I,"), but in the actual text provided, that part isn't present. Wait, looking back, the user provided a long text. Let me check for any grammatical errors. The narrative flows well, uses correct punctuation. Maybe some long sentences, but they're clear. So Fluency score might be high, maybe 5, since it's a well-known work with no errors.

Now Coherence. The story has a clear structure: introduction of the family, interactions with the ghost, the girl's empathy, resolution. Each chapter builds on the previous. The themes of American vs. British culture, the ghost's attempts, and the emotional resolution with Virginia are well-connected. However, there might be some abrupt scene changes between chapters, but given it's divided into chapters, that's expected. The prophecy in the library window ties into the ending, showing coherence. So Coherence score is likely 5 as well.

Wait, but the user might have included errors in the text they provided? Let me double-check. The text provided seems to be the original story without typos. So both scores should be 5. But maybe the user introduced some errors? Wait, the initial instruction says "You will be given a human-written text." The text here is the actual Canterville Ghost, which is fluent and coherent. Unless there's a trick, but the task is to rate as per the given text. So the answer should be both 5.
