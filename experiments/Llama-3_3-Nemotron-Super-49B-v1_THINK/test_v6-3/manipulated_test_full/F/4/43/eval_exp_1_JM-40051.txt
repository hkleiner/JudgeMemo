Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long and dense, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, looking at Fluency. The author's writing style seems old-fashioned, which might be expected if it's from the 19th century. But fluency isn't just about modernity; it's about clarity and errors. I notice some archaic language and long, winding sentences. For example, sentences like "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The structure here is a bit awkward with the comma after "evidently." There are also repetitive phrases and unclear transitions between ideas. 

Checking for specific issues: Are there grammar errors? The text has some, like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians." Spelling mistakes like "admirirg" instead of "admiring." Syntax issues, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place" – the structure here is a bit confusing. Lexicon-wise, some word choices are outdated or overly formal, which might impede smooth reading.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between describing the garden's location, biblical references, and personal anecdotes. There's a lack of clear structure; the author meanders through different topics without strong transitions. For example, the shift from geological descriptions to discussing dairy farming in the area feels abrupt. Logical flow is disrupted by these jumps. Also, there are assumptions the reader might not share, like equating the Mississippi with the Euphrates without clear justification. The argument for the garden's location relies heavily on unproven claims and personal belief rather than logical evidence.

For both metrics, the most serious issues are the frequent grammatical and spelling errors affecting fluency, and the disjointed structure with lack of logical progression in coherence. Despite the challenges, the text is mostly readable, so scores probably aren't the lowest. Fluency might be a 3 due to multiple errors but still understandable. Coherence could be a 2.5 because while some parts connect, overall it's hard to follow the main argument due to tangents and poor transitions.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Frequent archaic sentence structures and minor grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg").  
- [SPELLING] Occasional typos (e.g., "comminced," "scenery now around us surpasses").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence constructions disrupting flow.  
- [LEXICON] Outdated vocabulary and overly formal tone.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking Mississippi to Euphrates) and weak causal connections.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear organization; abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., dairy farming, geology, biblical interpretation).  
- [CLARITY] Assumptions without explanation (e.g., "mound-builders" context).  
- [TRANSITION] Poor linking of ideas; repetitive appeals ("Come and see!") without logical progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
