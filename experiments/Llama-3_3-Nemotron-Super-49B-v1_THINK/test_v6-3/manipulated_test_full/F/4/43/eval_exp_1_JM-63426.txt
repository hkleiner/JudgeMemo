Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific labels and then score each on a 1-5 scale with half-points allowed.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a biography of Will Bradley, structured with chapters and an afterword. The text is quite lengthy, so I'll need to look for patterns rather than every single error.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might be intentional given the historical context (late 19th and early 20th centuries). However, there are some noticeable issues. For example, in the "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION," there's a sentence that seems garbled: "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." That looks like a major syntax error or possibly a typo. Also, in "CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING," there's a part where the text jumps abruptly without clear transitions, like "Your for a visit East uncle back aunt “go and.”" which is hard to parse.

For Coherence, the structure and logical flow are key. The text has many chapters, each covering a different period in Bradley's life. However, some transitions between chapters feel abrupt. For instance, moving from his childhood to his time in Chicago without a clear link. Also, within chapters, there are paragraphs that list various events or projects without connecting them cohesively. The afterword seems to repeat some information from the chronology, which might disrupt the flow.

Now, labeling the issues. For Fluency, the main problems are [SYNTAX] errors like the garbled sentence, [SPELLING] if there are typos (though I didn't spot obvious ones), and [LEXICON] if word choices are awkward. The example sentence definitely has syntax issues. 

For Coherence, [STRUCTURE] is an issue with abrupt chapter transitions, [TRANSITION] problems within paragraphs, and possibly [LOGIC] if events are illogical, though here it's more about presentation than logic.

Scoring: Fluency has some major errors but the text is mostly readable. The severe syntax error in one place might deduct more, but overall, it's mostly fluent with minor issues, so maybe a 4? But wait, that one sentence is really bad. Maybe 3.5 because despite the overall flow, there are noticeable disruptions.

Coherence: The structure is mostly clear, but transitions are weak. The text is generally coherent but with some awkward shifts. So maybe a 3 or 3.5. Since the issues are more in transitions and structure repetition, perhaps 3.5 as well.

Wait, the user's scale says Score 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways." The Fluency issue here has at least one major syntax error and some awkward phrasing, but overall readable. So maybe 3.5 for Fluency because it's mostly okay but with some notable errors.

For Coherence, the structure is there but with weak transitions and some repetition (like the afterword repeating chronology points). So Coherence might be a 3, as it's generally coherent but with noticeable problems.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severe sentence fragmentation (e.g., "It about state and it...") disrupting readability.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "lusty, democratic ambition") may cause minor confusion.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., childhood to Chicago career).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connective phrases between paragraphs (e.g., "Your for a visit East uncle...").  
- [REPEAT] Redundant information (e.g., chronology details repeated in afterword).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
