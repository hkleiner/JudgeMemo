Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

First, Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text provided is quite long, so I need to scan through and find any errors or awkward phrasing.

Looking at the text, I notice some archaic language and long sentences, which might affect readability. For example, phrases like "I have encounter here" should be "I have encountered here." There are a few grammatical errors like "you was" instead of "you were." Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. 

Now, Coherence. This is about how well the ideas are connected, logical flow, transitions, etc. The text is autobiographical, spanning many chapters. Each chapter seems to focus on a different period, but there might be abrupt shifts between them. For instance, moving from childhood to Chicago without clear transitions. However, the overall structure is chronological, which helps coherence. But some parts, like the "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" chapter, feel a bit disconnected from the rest. Also, there's a lot of detail that might not be necessary, causing some sections to feel disjointed.

I need to categorize the issues. For Fluency, the main problems are GRAMMAR errors, some SYNTAX issues with long sentences, and LEXICON choices that are outdated. For Coherence, the STRUCTURE has some abrupt shifts, and TRANSITIONS between chapters could be better. 

Scoring: Fluency has several errors but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 3.5? Coherence is generally okay but with some disconnects, so maybe a 3. 

Wait, let me double-check. The Fluency scale says 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow." Yes, that fits. The Coherence scale for 3 is "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts... affect the reading experience." That also fits. 

So final scores: Fluency 3.5 (since some parts are quite fluent, but errors are present), Coherence 3.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Sporadic grammatical errors (e.g., "you was," "hasnâ€™t long to live")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing ("thou," "whilst")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some narrative segments  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
