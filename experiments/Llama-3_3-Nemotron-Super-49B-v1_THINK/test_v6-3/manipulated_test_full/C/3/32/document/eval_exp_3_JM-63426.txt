Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, split into chapters. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. Scanning through the text, I notice some archaic language and long sentences, which might affect readability. There are also some missing or replaced words with "[stuff]" which could be placeholders or errors. For example, phrases like "a thing" or "the stuff" repeated many times. These might disrupt the flow because the reader has to infer what's missing. Also, the structure within chapters seems a bit disjointed with abrupt shifts between topics, like jumping from Bradley's childhood to his career without clear transitions.

Now, Coherence. This is about the logical structure, connections between ideas, and overall organization. The text has multiple chapters, each covering a different period. However, there are abrupt jumps, like moving from his time in Chicago to Springfield without a smooth transition. The use of "[stuff]" again causes confusion, making it hard to follow the narrative thread. Some sections feel like a list of events rather than a cohesive story. For example, the "CHRONOLOGY" section is a list, which is coherent on its own but might disrupt the narrative flow when included in the main text.

For Fluency score: The text is mostly readable, but the placeholders and long sentences cause issues. Maybe a 3.5? It's not highly fluent due to the archaic terms and missing content, but it's not completely unintelligible.

For Coherence score: The overall structure is there with chapters, but within chapters, there are jumps and missing links. The placeholders hurt the coherence. Maybe a 3? Generally coherent but with noticeable disruptions.

Wait, but the chronology is clear, and each chapter has a topic. However, the internal coherence within chapters suffers from the [stuff] placeholders and some lack of transitions. So maybe Coherence is a 3, and Fluency, considering the errors and archaic language, also a 3.5?

Alternatively, Fluency might be lower because of the frequent [stuff] which acts like missing words, causing confusion. But the rest of the grammar seems okay. So Fluency could be 3, and Coherence 3 as well. But I need to check the scales again.

Fluency Scale: 
- 5: Highly fluent, minimal errors.
- 4: Mostly fluent, minor issues.
- 3: Generally readable but multiple issues interrupting flow.
The text has many [stuff] which are like missing words, causing frequent interruptions. So maybe Fluency is 3.

Coherence Scale:
- 5: Highly coherent, logical progression.
- 4: Mostly coherent, few weak parts.
- 3: Generally coherent but noticeable issues.
The text's structure is mostly logical by chapters, but within chapters, the [stuff] and some jumps (e.g., between paragraphs without clear links) cause issues. So Coherence might be 3.

But wait, the chronology section is well-structured, but the main narrative has problems. Overall, I think both scores would be 3. However, the Fluency might be slightly higher because aside from the placeholders, the language, though old-fashioned, is mostly correct. So Fluency 3.5 and Coherence 3.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "stuff," "thing") and missing/replaced terms disrupt clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences impair readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts within chapters (e.g., career jumps).  
- [CLARITY] Repeated placeholders ("[stuff]") obscure narrative flow and context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
