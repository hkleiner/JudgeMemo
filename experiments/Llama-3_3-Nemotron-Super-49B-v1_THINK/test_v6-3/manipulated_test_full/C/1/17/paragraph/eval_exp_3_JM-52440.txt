Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability. The sentences are long and complex, which could make them hard to follow. I notice some archaic language like "thou" and "thee" in quotes, but those are probably intentional citations. Checking for grammar, spelling, or syntax errors... Hmm, the structure seems mostly correct, but the lengthy sentences might cause some confusion. Maybe some commas are missing, but not sure. Overall, it's mostly fluent but with minor issues due to style and length.

Now Coherence. The text is structured with chapters and clear topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each part seems to follow logically, addressing a point and then supporting it with references. However, there are abrupt shifts where unrelated paragraphs are inserted (like the parts about Dickens, Millet, George Stransom, etc.). These seem out of place and disrupt the flow. The main argument is clear, but these unrelated sections cause confusion. Also, transitions between some paragraphs could be smoother. The overall structure is logical, but those random inserts hurt coherence a lot.

So for Fluency, the main issues are long sentences and archaic style, but no major errors. For Coherence, the big problem is the unrelated paragraphs breaking the flow. 

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent but some minor issues. Maybe a 4? Because it's well-structured despite the complexity.

Coherence: The unrelated sections are a big problem. Even though the main flow is logical, those breaks make it a 3. Because while generally coherent, there are significant disruptions.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [COMPLEXITY] Excessively long, complex sentences impair readability. - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and formal tone may hinder modern comprehension.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated paragraphs disrupt thematic continuity. - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear links between some sections (e.g., random literary/math inserts).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
