Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, each with their own sub-aspects, and then score them from 1 to 5.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a historical theological essay from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The text is quite long, formal, and dense with theological arguments and references to Church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies.

Starting with Fluency:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**: The text uses complex sentences, which is typical for formal writing. I need to check if there are any grammatical errors. The example given in the text has "we was taught" which should be "we were taught". That's a clear error. Also, "was" used incorrectly in a few places, like "the bread and wine was" instead of "were". These are noticeable errors affecting correctness.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Scanning through, I see old-style punctuation (e.g., multiple periods in abbreviations like "St. John." with two dots), but that's stylistic. No obvious spelling mistakes, but the archaic style might cause flow issues for modern readers.

3. **Word Choice**: Vocabulary is formal and appropriate for theological discourse. Words like "consecration", "transubstantiation" are correct but might make the text less accessible. However, for the intended audience, it's suitable.

4. **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkward, like "we was taught by our Lord Himself". The subject-verb agreement error here disrupts flow. Also, long sentences with multiple clauses can make reading cumbersome.

5. **Flow**: Transitions between paragraphs are generally logical, but the text jumps between explaining doctrines and critiquing opposing views without clear section breaks. The chapters help, but within chapters, the flow could be smoother.

Now Coherence:

1. **Logical Sequencing**: The structure is clear: Introduction, then chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice. Each chapter analyzes Church documents sequentially. Logical, but dense.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**: Some points are repeated for emphasis, like the distinction between sign and thing signified. While not unnecessary, it could be more concise.

3. **Smooth Connections**: Transitions between ideas within paragraphs could be better. For example, shifting from discussing Articles to Catechism is logical but abrupt without transitional phrases.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The author defines key terms but assumes reader familiarity with theological concepts. Some explanations, like the distinction between substance and accidents, might be unclear without background.

5. **Structural Consistency**: The overall structure is consistent, using Church documents in order. However, the writing style varies between scholarly analysis and passionate appeal, which might disrupt consistency.

Scoring:

Fluency: The main issues are grammatical errors ("we was"), some awkward phrasing, and archaic style affecting readability. Despite formal vocabulary, the errors and flow issues bring it down. Maybe a 3? Because while it's mostly clear, the mistakes are notable.

Coherence: Logical structure, but some repetition, abrupt transitions, and assumptions of prior knowledge. The author stays on topic but could improve connections and clarity. Maybe a 4? It's well-structured but not perfectly smooth.

Wait, but the fluency has clear grammatical errors which are significant. That's a major flaw. Maybe Fluency is 2 or 3. Coherence is more about overall logic and structure, which is there but with some flaws.

Revising: Fluency has errors in Syntax (definite mistakes), so that aspect is poor. Spelling okay, word choice appropriate but formal. Phrasing sometimes awkward, flow impacted by long sentences and errors. So Fluency score might be 3.

Coherence: Logical sequencing yes, some repetition but not excessive. Connections could be smoother, ambiguity in assuming knowledge, structure consistent. So Coherence maybe 4.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

---

**Fluency Evaluation:**  
- **Syntax and Grammar**: Noticeable errors (e.g., "we was taught," inconsistent verb tense) detract from correctness.  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Archaisms (e.g., "St. John.") but no critical errors.  
- **Word Choice**: Formal vocabulary appropriate for the context but occasionally opaque.  
- **Phrasing**: Awkward constructions (e.g., "we was") and overly complex sentences.  
- **Flow**: Interrupted by grammatical mistakes and dense, unbroken paragraphs.  

**Coherence Evaluation:**  
- **Logical Sequencing**: Clear chapter structure, but transitions within sections are abrupt.  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: Key distinctions (e.g., sign vs. thing signified) are repeated for emphasis but could be condensed
