Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of this historical theological text. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria provided. 

Starting with Fluency. The aspects are Syntax & Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation, Word Choice, Phrasing, and Flow. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and archaic. I'll look for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, word choices that might be outdated but still appropriate, phrasing that's awkward, and how smoothly the text transitions.

Coherence has aspects like Logical Sequencing, Non-repetitiveness, Smooth Connections, Ambiguity Avoidance, and Structural Consistency. The text is structured with chapters and sections, which is good. I need to check if ideas follow logically, if there's unnecessary repetition, if transitions between sections are clear, if any parts are unclear, and if the structure is consistent.

Looking at the text, the syntax is complex with long sentences, typical of older writing. There are some spelling variations (e.g., "Taughtvby" probably a typo for "Taught by"), but overall spelling and punctuation seem correct for the era. Word choice is formal but appropriate. Phrasing might be wordy or awkward for modern readers. Flow is maintained through logical paragraphs, but the density of information might make it hard to follow.

For coherence, the structure is clear with chapters addressing different topics. The author repeats some points to emphasize, especially when refuting opposing views, which might be seen as repetitive. Transitions between chapters are smooth. Some sections are dense and might cause ambiguity, but overall, the author clarifies key points. The structure is consistent, using Church documents to support arguments.

Now, scoring. Fluency: Despite some archaic language and lengthy sentences, the text is well-constructed. Minor typos but not disruptive. I'd rate Fluency a 4. 

Coherence: Well-structured, logical flow, though some repetition. Clear connections between sections. Maybe a 4 here too, as the structure is strong but some density might confuse readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

**Coherence Evaluation:**  
- **Logical Sequencing**: The text is highly structured, with each chapter addressing a distinct aspect of the doctrine (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Ideas unfold logically, building on Church documents.  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: While the author repeats core distinctions (e.g., spiritual vs. material feeding) for emphasis, this repetition clarifies complex theological contrasts rather than redundantly restate the same point.  
- **Smooth Connections**: Transitions between chapters and sections (e.g., shifting from Articles to Catechism to Homilies) are clear and intentional.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The author explicitly disambiguates terms (e.g., distinguishing "Sacrament" as either the whole rite or just the elements) and confronts potential misunderstandings directly.  
- **Structural Consistency**: The framework (Chapter I-III, systematic analysis of Church documents) is rigorously maintained.  

**Fluency Evaluation:**  
- **Syntax & Grammar**: Complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "Now it would be strange indeed...") are grammatically correct but challenging for modern readers.  
- **Spelling & Punctuation**: Minor typos (e.g., "Taughtvby," "inbdonnexionn") are rare and do not disrupt flow. Punctuation is consistent with 19th-century conventions.  
- **Word Choice**: Formal, theological vocabulary (e.g., "transaccidentation") is appropriate for the context but may require familiarity with ecclesiastical terminology.  
- **Phrasing**: Some phrases are wordy or awkwardly verbose (e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him"), but clarity is prioritized over brevity.  
- **Flow**: Transitions between sentences are generally smooth, though dense paragraphs and repetitive rhetorical flourishes (e.g., "Oh! how did my heart burn...") occasionally slow the pace.  

Both scores reflect strong organizational coherence and meticulous attention to theological clarity, despite stylistic challenges due to its historical context.
