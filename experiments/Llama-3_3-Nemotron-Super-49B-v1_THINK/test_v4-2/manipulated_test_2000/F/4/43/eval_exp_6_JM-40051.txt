Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence, each with their own aspects. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, Fluency. The aspects are Syntax and Grammar, Spelling and Punctuation, Word Choice, Phrasing, and Flow.

Looking at Syntax and Grammar: The text is mostly correct, but there are some long, convoluted sentences. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." That's a bit awkward but grammatically okay. However, there are places like "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," which seems completely garbled. That's a major error. So Syntax and Grammar has issues, especially in that one paragraph.

Spelling and Punctuation: The main body seems okay, but there's a section with "Nineteen been at lost a..." which has multiple errors. Also, some commas might be misplaced, but overall not too bad except for that messed-up part.

Word Choice: The vocabulary is somewhat formal and old-fashioned (e.g., "veritable", "antldiluvians", "providentially"), which might make it less smooth for modern readers. Some words like "euphony" are correct but less common. Not a huge issue, but contributes to a slightly archaic feel.

Phrasing: Many sentences are long and winding, making them hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting "Since I commenced to publish my views..." has multiple clauses. Some phrasing is awkward, like "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" – "plat" might confuse some readers.

Flow: The text jumps between biblical references, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions. Transitions could be smoother. For instance, moving from discussing the garden's location to talking about snakes feels abrupt.

Now Coherence. Aspects: Logical Sequencing, Non-repetitiveness, Smooth Connections, Ambiguity Avoidance, Structural Consistency.

Logical Sequencing: The text starts with the author's discovery, then dives into biblical context, then location details. It's somewhat logical but meanders. The part about snakes seems out of place without clear connection.

Non-repetitiveness: The author repeats the uniqueness of the garden and its features multiple times, which could be condensed.

Smooth Connections: Transitions between ideas are weak. For example, after describing the garden, suddenly talking about snakes without a link.

Ambiguity Avoidance: Terms like "plat" and "antideluvians" might be unclear to some. The structure of the garden's description is confusing without a visual.

Structural Consistency: The narrative mixes personal reflection, biblical analysis, and geographical details inconsistently. The ending feels abrupt.

Considering all this, Fluency is hurt by the garbled paragraph and awkward phrasing, but mostly coherent otherwise. Coherence suffers from poor transitions and some ambiguity. I'd rate Fluency a 3 because despite some issues, it's mostly readable. Coherence maybe a 2 due to more significant structural and connectivity problems.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

### **Coherence Issues (Score: 2)**  
- **Logical Sequencing**: Ideas jump abruptly (e.g., biblical analysis → snake anecdotes → geography).  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: Overemphasis on the garden’s uniqueness without new insights.  
- **Smooth Connections**: Lack of clear transitions (e.g., "Now that we are up where we can see..." feels disconnected).  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Terms like "plat" and vague descriptions (e.g., "second bank" geography) confuse context.  
- **Structural Consistency**: Mixes personal, biblical, and geographical narratives inconsistently.  

### **Fluency Issues (Score: 3)**  
- **Syntax and Grammar**: One paragraph ("Nineteen been at lost a…") is severely garbled; otherwise, sentences are overly complex but grammatical.  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Major errors in the corrupted paragraph; occasional misplaced commas.  
- **Word Choice**: Archaic vocabulary ("antldiluvians," "providentially") and awkward phrasing ("standing on the hanging garden").  
- **Phrasing**: Long, winding sentences (e.g., "Since I commenced to publish my views…").  
- **Flow**: Disruptions from abrupt topic shifts (e.g., snakes in "Hanging Garden" description).
