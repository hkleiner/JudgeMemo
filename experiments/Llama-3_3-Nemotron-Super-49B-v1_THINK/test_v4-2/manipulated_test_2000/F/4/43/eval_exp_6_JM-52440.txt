Okay, let's tackle this assessment. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, each with their own aspects. First, I need to go through the text carefully and note any issues related to the specified aspects for both metrics.

Starting with Fluency. The aspects are Syntax & Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation, Word Choice, Phrasing, and Flow. 

Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-constructed grammatically. I didn't spot any major syntax errors. Spelling and punctuation seem correct too; the text uses proper commas, periods, and there are no obvious typos. Word choice is formal and appropriate for the theological context. However, some phrases might be a bit archaic ("IT is a very easy thing...") which could affect smoothness for modern readers. Phrasing is mostly good, but a few sentences are quite long and complex, which might make them slightly awkward. The flow between sentences is logical, but the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, moving from discussing the Church's documents to the personal belief about St. John's chapter feels a bit abrupt.

Now Coherence. The aspects are Logical Sequencing, Non-repetitiveness, Smooth Connections, Ambiguity Avoidance, and Structural Consistency. 

The text is well-structured, starting with an introduction, then Chapter I. The logical flow is there, but some points are repeated, like the emphasis on examining the Church's documents, which could be condensed. Transitions between ideas (e.g., from Scripture to Church doctrines) are generally smooth but could benefit from clearer linking phrases. There's some ambiguity in explanations, especially when contrasting views without clear summaries. The structure is consistent, following a logical investigation path, but the depth of analysis might overwhelm some readers.

For Fluency, the main issues are in Phrasing (long sentences) and Flow (transitions). For Coherence, Non-repetitiveness and Ambiguity could be improved. 

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because while it's strong, the phrasing and flow have minor issues. Coherence is also a 4 since the structure is good but with some repetition and ambiguity.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

### **Fluency Issues (Score: 4/5)**  
- **Phrasing**: Some sentences are overly long and complex (e.g., "That the material food is an emblem..."), risking awkwardness.  
- **Flow**: Transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from Scripture to Church documents) could be smoother with clearer connective phrases.  
- **Word Choice**: Formal tone is appropriate, but archaic language (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing") may disrupt modern readability.  

### **Coherence Issues (Score: 4/5)**  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: Repetitions (e.g., emphasis on "examining the Church’s own documents") could be condensed for efficiency.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Complex theological distinctions (e.g., "real objective presence" vs. Reformation principles) require clearer summaries for clarity.  
- **Logical Sequencing**: Ideas are mostly logical, but subsections (e.g., shifting between Rome’s view and the Church of England’s) occasionally feel fragmented.
