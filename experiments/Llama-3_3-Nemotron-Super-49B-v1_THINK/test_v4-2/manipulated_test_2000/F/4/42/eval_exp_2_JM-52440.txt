Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to assess the given text's fluency and coherence based on the detailed aspects provided. First, I need to go through each aspect for both fluency and coherence, note the issues, and then score them from 1 to 5.

Starting with Fluency. The aspects are Syntax & Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation, Word Choice, Phrasing, and Flow.

Looking at the text, there are several grammatical errors. For example, "was" instead of "were" in "a blind consent is blindly give." Also, "am" instead of "are" in "the real groundwork of that opinion am examined." These are clear syntax issues. Spelling and punctuation seem okay, except maybe some archaic uses like "was" in places, but maybe that's intentional for the style. Word choice is mostly appropriate but sometimes verbose, like "sifting time" which might be less common. Phrasing has some awkwardness, like "it would be strange indeed if..." which is a bit formal but not necessarily wrong. Flow is generally good despite length, but some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

For Coherence, the aspects are Logical Sequencing, Non-repetitiveness, Smooth Connections, Ambiguity Avoidance, and Structural Consistency. The text is well-structured with clear chapters and points. However, there's some repetition in explaining the doctrine comparisons, like repeating the distinction between the Church of England and Rome. Connections between ideas are mostly smooth, but the shift from discussing Scripture to Church documents could be clearer. Ambiguity is minimal, but terms like "real objective presence" might need more context for some readers. The structure is consistent, following a logical investigation path.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the grammatical errors, the rest is strong. Maybe a 4? Coherence is strong in structure but has minor repetitions and some ambiguity, so maybe a 4 as well. Wait, but the grammatical errors are quite frequent. Maybe Fluency should be lower, like 3? But the overall flow is maintained. Hmm. Need to balance the errors against the rest. Maybe Fluency 3 because the errors affect it noticeably, even if other aspects are good. Coherence is more consistent, so 4.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**  

---

### **Coherence Evaluation (Score: 4/5)**  
- **Logical Sequencing**: The text follows a clear, investigative structure (e.g., defining terms, contrasting doctrines, analyzing Church documents).  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: Minor repetition in distinguishing Church of England views from Rome (e.g., repeated emphasis on "no change in substance"), but not excessive.  
- **Smooth Connections**: Transitions between ideas (e.g., Scripture → Church documents) are mostly logical, though occasional shifts (e.g., from theological debate to the Church’s plight) feel slightly abrupt.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Terms like "real objective presence" are clarified, but some readers may struggle with unreferenced biblical contexts (e.g., "the 6th chapter of St. John").  
- **Structural Consistency**: Clear chapter divisions and a consistent analytical approach maintain coherence.  

### **Fluency Evaluation (Score: 3/5)**  
- **Syntax and Grammar**: Frequent subject-verb errors (e.g., "a blind consent is blindly give," "the real groundwork... am examined") and inconsistent verb tenses.  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: No major errors, but archaic phrasing (e.g., "was" in conditional statements) may disrupt modern readers’ flow.  
- **Word Choice**: Mostly formal and appropriate, but overly verbose in places (e.g., "sifting time," "endeavoured to ascertain").  
- **Phrasing**: Awkward constructions (e.g., "it would be strange indeed if...") and overly long sentences reduce clarity.  
- **Flow**: While paragraphs logically progress, transitions between sentences often rely on simple conjunctions ("and," "thus"), lacking polish.

The text excels in **coherence** due to its structured argumentation and clear goals but falters slightly in **fluency** due to grammatical inconsistencies and archaic phrasing.
