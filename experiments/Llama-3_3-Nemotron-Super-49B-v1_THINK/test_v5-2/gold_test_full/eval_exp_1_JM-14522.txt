Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, giving scores from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, right? I remember it's a comedic ghost story with a lot of humor and satire.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads—syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Since it's a classic work by Wilde, the language is formal and Victorian. There might be some archaic terms or complex sentences, but that's typical for the era. I didn't notice any grammatical errors. The vocabulary is rich, which might make it less fluent for modern readers, but according to the criteria, it's about the text's inherent quality. So Fluency should be high, maybe 5.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the story unfolding logically, connections between ideas, no abrupt jumps. The narrative has a clear structure: introduction of the Otis family, their interactions with the ghost, the ghost's attempts to scare them, Virginia's empathy, and the resolution with the ghost's death. Each chapter builds on the previous, and the plot flows logically. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistent. The only possible issue might be the abrupt shift when Virginia disappears and comes back with the ghost dead, but it's explained through the secret passage and the prophecy. The ending ties up with the funeral and the future marriage, so coherence is strong. Maybe a 5 here too.

Wait, are there any points of deduction? For Fluency, maybe some readers might find the long, winding sentences or outdated references (like specific actors or historical figures) to disrupt flow, but the question is about the text's own quality, not reader difficulty. So Fluency remains 5. For Coherence, the story has a clear beginning, middle, end, and the supernatural elements are handled consistently. The character motivations, especially the ghost's growing frustration and Virginia's compassion, are well-developed. No major gaps or inconsistencies. So Coherence is also 5.

I think both scores should be 5. The issues list might mention the formal language affecting modern fluency, but since the criteria don't consider reader background, it's not a deduction. Similarly, the coherence is well-maintained throughout.

Issues: 
- Formal, archaic language may impede modern readers' fluency due to complex syntax and dated references.
- Subtle thematic transitions (e.g., Virginia’s disappearance) rely on prophecy and supernatural logic, potentially taxing coherence for some readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
