Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate a story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story provided is a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text readsâ€”syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation. The text is formal, written in an old style ( chapters, "THE" capitalized, antiquated language like "thus", "whereof", "whomsoever"). The sentences are long and complex, which might make it hard to follow for modern readers, but grammatically correct. I didn't notice any spelling or punctuation errors. Word choice is appropriate for the topic but archaic. So Fluency might be high because it's well-structured despite being dense.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, clear progression, no ambiguities. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author references Church documents systematically (Articles, Catechism, etc.), which shows a clear structure. However, the text is quite repetitive in refuting the Real Presence doctrine and contrasting with Roman Catholic views. The author repeats points about the Church's documents contradicting Real Presence, which might be necessary for emphasis but could be seen as repetitive. The flow is logical, moving from general to specific, using each chapter to dissect an aspect. There's a clear thesis and consistent argument throughout. 

Potential issues for Coherence: Repetition of the same argument points across chapters, which might make it slightly less engaging but still logical. For Fluency, the archaic style and lengthy sentences could affect readability but don't hinder understanding for the intended audience.

So, Fluency score: The text is grammatically correct, no errors, but the style is formal and dense. Maybe a 4 because while it's fluent in terms of correctness, the readability is lower due to complexity.

Coherence score: The structure is clear, each chapter builds on the topic, but there's some repetition. The author effectively uses Church documents to support the argument. Maybe a 4 as well because while coherent, the repetition might deduct a point.

Wait, but the evaluation criteria for Coherence include "non-repetitive" ideas. The text does repeat the central argument across chapters, so that's a point deduction. But the structure is very logical. So maybe Coherence is a 4. Fluency, despite being correct, the archaic language and long sentences might make it a 4 as well. Alternatively, if the archaic style is considered part of the genre and acceptable, Fluency could be 5. But since Fluency also considers "how the text reads from start to finish" and smoothness, the complexity might bring it down to 4.

Final decision: Fluency 4 (correct but challenging readability), Coherence 4 (logical but repetitive).

Issues: 
- Archaisms and lengthy sentences may impede modern readability (Fluency).
- Repetitive refutations of the Real Presence doctrine across chapters (Coherence).

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
