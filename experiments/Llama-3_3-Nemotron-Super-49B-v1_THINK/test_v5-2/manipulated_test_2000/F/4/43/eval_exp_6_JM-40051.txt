Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using a 1-5 scale. First, I need to understand the criteria properly. 

Starting with Fluency: This is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is from the late 19th or early 20th century, judging by the style. There are some archaic terms and sentence structures, but that's expected. However, I notice a few typos like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "scientest" (scientist), and "commencing more than half way up the mound" (maybe "halfway"?). Also, some long, winding sentences might affect readability, but overall, the language is formal and mostly correct for its time. So Fluency might be a 4, deducting for the typos and complexity.

Now Coherence: The story has a clear structureâ€”the author presents a discovery, backs it with biblical references, describes the location, and defends its validity. The narrative flows logically from introduction to evidence to conclusion. However, there are abrupt jumps, like the paragraph starting with "Nineteen been at lost a..." which seems garbled and disrupts the flow. Also, some sections repeat ideas (e.g., describing the garden's beauty multiple times) and there's a mix of biblical analysis, geographical description, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions. The serpent part feels a bit tacked on. Despite this, the overall argument is consistent. Maybe a 3 for Coherence due to the jumps and repetitions.

Wait, but the author connects each part to the Garden of Eden claim. The main issue is the disrupted paragraph and some repetition. Maybe Coherence is a 3 or 4? Let me check again. The disrupted text ("Nineteen been at lost...") is a major issue, causing confusion. That's a big coherence problem. So Coherence score would be lower, like 3. Fluency, despite some errors, is mostly okay, so 4.

Finalizing: Issues would include the garbled paragraph, some typos, repetitive descriptions, and lack of smooth transitions. Fluency 4, Coherence 3.

Issues: 
- Archaisms and overly complex sentence structures may hinder readability.
- Minor typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "scientest").
- One severely garbled paragraph disrupts coherence ("Nineteen been at lost a...").
- Repetitive descriptions of scenery without clear transitions.
- Abrupt shift in tone when introducing rattlesnakes.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
