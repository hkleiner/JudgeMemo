Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully and assess both Coherence and Fluency based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency: The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. There are long sentences, but they seem grammatically correct. I notice some repetitive phrasing, like "it is... that" repeated, but no major grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary is appropriate, though a bit dense. So Fluency might be high, maybe 4 or 5. But wait, there's a part in Chapter I where the text seems jumbled: "That the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This looks like a typo or formatting error. That would deduct points for Fluency. So maybe a 3 or 4?

For Coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and a logical progression from introduction to examining the doctrine. The author sets a goal and follows through, using religious documents as evidence. However, the discussion might be too dense and repetitive. The transition between paragraphs could be smoother. Also, the jumbled text in Chapter I disrupts coherence. But overall, the argument is logically sequenced. Maybe a 4 for Coherence, considering the structure but deducting for clarity and the error.

Wait, the jumbled part affects both metrics. For Fluency, it's a clear error, so that's a big issue. For Coherence, if the text is unreadable there, it affects understanding. So Fluency score might drop to 3 because of that error. Coherence might be 3 as well if the error causes confusion, but the overall structure is logical otherwise.

So finalizing: Fluency 3 due to the jumbled section and some awkward phrasing. Coherence 4 because despite the error, the overall structure and logical flow are maintained.

Issues: 
- Severe formatting/error in a paragraph (e.g., "That the of two perfectly..."), disrupting readability.
- Archaisms and overly complex sentence structures may impede smooth flow.
- Mild repetition in introductory phrases ("it is... that").

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
