Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency. First, I'll read through the story again to spot any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written with good grammar and spelling. However, there are a few spots with awkward phrasing or missing words. For example, in the first chapter, "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." That sentence seems jumbled and hard to understand. Maybe a typo or missing punctuation. Also, in the second chapter, phrases like "the cars steamboats trains drawings of sailboats: is, blackboard, covered, chalk houses with, ferryboats, people and animals." The colon and listing without clear connection might disrupt flow. Some sentences are long and complex, which could affect readability, but overall, the language is fluent except for those specific errors.

Now Coherence. The story has two chapters. The first introduces Will Bradley's impact, and the second tells his childhood. The connection between the chapters seems logical as an intro and backstory. However, the transition between them isn't explicitly stated; it just jumps. Within each chapter, the ideas are mostly sequential. In Chapter 2, the narrative follows his early life events chronologically, but some parts feel a bit disjointed, like the sudden shift from school to working at the newspaper without clear transitions. Also, the part about the faker selling soap at the end of Chapter 2 feels abrupt and unresolved. It starts describing a scene but doesn't conclude it, which might confuse the reader.

So for Fluency, despite some errors and awkward sentences, the majority is fluent. Maybe a 4? For Coherence, the overall structure is okay, but the transition between chapters and some internal jumps deduct points. Maybe a 4 as well, but need to check if the issues are more severe.

Wait, the faker scene at the end—does it connect to anything? It just ends there. That's a coherence issue. Also, in Chapter 1, the jump from talking about Bradley's influence to his retirement and then the young men might need smoother connections. But overall, the narrative is clear. The main problems are the unresolved scene and some transitions. So Coherence might be a 4, but if the unresolved part is significant, maybe 3.5, but since scores are integers, 4.

Fluency: The errors are specific but not pervasive. So 4. Coherence: Some structural issues but generally holds. So 4 each.

Issues: 
- Sporadic grammatical/spelling errors (e.g., "Bradley may Press started...") and awkward phrasing (e.g., "the cars steamboats trains drawings...").
- Abrupt, unresolved scene (faker selling soap) at the end of Chapter 2.
- Mild disjointedness in transitions (e.g., chapter-to-chapter shift, sudden job changes in Chapter 2).

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
