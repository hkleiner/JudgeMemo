Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each scored from 1 to 5. I need to list the issues in bullet points and then provide the scores.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, but there are obvious grammatical and spelling errors throughout. For Fluency, I need to check syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. The original story is known for its wit and smooth flow, but the version here has many mistakes. Examples like "every one tell him" instead of "everyone told him", "when they come to discuss terms" should be "came", "am see" instead of "has been seen", "reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'dded have it at home" – "we'd have" is correct. There are also subject-verb agreement issues, like "Mr. Otis have telegraphed", "the family go down", "they sat down and begin to looked round". Tense inconsistencies, like "had been spilt" and "was removed" in the same context. Word choice errors, such as "am his only weaknesses" instead of "were".

For Coherence, the story structure seems intact—Lord Canterville warns Otis, the family moves in, encounters the ghost, etc. But some transitions might be abrupt due to the errors. However, the overall narrative flow is logical despite the mistakes. The ghost's appearance and the family's reactions are consistent with the original story's humor and progression. No major gaps or illogical jumps, just the errors affecting Fluency.

So, Fluency issues are plentiful, which would lower that score. Coherence remains good because the story's structure and logic hold up even with the errors. I need to list the specific Fluency problems and note that Coherence is less affected.

Now, scoring: Fluency would be lower, maybe 2 because of frequent errors but still understandable. Coherence might be 4 since the story makes sense overall despite the flaws.

Issues: 
- Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "every one tell him", "when they come", "am see", "we'dded").
- Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "had been spilt" vs. "was removed").
- Subject-verb agreement mistakes (e.g., "Mr. Otis have telegraphed", "the family go").
- Awkward phrasing and word choice errors (e.g., "am his only weaknesses", "looked round").
- Punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, incorrect quotation handling).
- Minor coherence disruption due to errors (e.g., "who do not quite understood").

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
