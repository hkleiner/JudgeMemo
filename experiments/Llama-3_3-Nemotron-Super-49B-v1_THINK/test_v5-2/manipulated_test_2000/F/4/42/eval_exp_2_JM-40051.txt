Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale, and list the issues in bullet points.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a 19th-century style text claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Midwest, specifically between La Crosse and Winona. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions.

For Fluency: Check grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice. The text has many grammatical errors like "had venture to published", "I is ignorant", "which had caused explorers... to the North Pole" (should be "who" instead of "which"). There are also archaic terms and inconsistent verb tenses. Despite the errors, the language is somewhat formal and flows okay in parts, but the mistakes are frequent.

For Coherence: The structure is a bit disjointed. The author jumps between biblical interpretation, personal discovery, and geographical details without smooth transitions. There's repetition in emphasizing the garden's features and the presence of snakes. The narrative isn't very logical in connecting ideas, and some parts feel abrupt, like the shift to talking about the city of La Crosse. However, the overall argument is clear even if the presentation is messy.

Issues to list: Grammar errors, inconsistent tense, awkward phrasing, disjointed structure, repetition, abrupt transitions.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 2 because of numerous errors but some flow. Coherence could be 3 since the main idea is there but execution is poor with jumps and repetition.

Issues: 
- Frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "had venture to published," "I is ignorant," inconsistent verb tense).
- Archaic or awkward phrasing (e.g., "the finger of time has am plainly pointing," "which had caused explorers... to the North Pole").
- Repetitive emphasis on the gardenâ€™s uniqueness without clear transitions.
- Disjointed structure (e.g., abrupt shift from biblical interpretation to local geography).
- Overly verbose descriptions with mixed metaphors (e.g., "wild scenery... being effaced by timber growth").

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
