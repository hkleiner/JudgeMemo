Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the provided story carefully. 

Starting with Fluency: I should check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is mostly formal and academic, discussing Dickens' work. I notice some grammatical errors like "he certainly write" (should be "wrote"), "was very disreputable for twenty-six years" (maybe "had been" instead of "was"), and "how coulded he hoped" ( incorrect "coulded"). There are also inconsistent verb tenses, like "We may thought" instead of "We might have thought". Some sentences are long and convoluted, which affects readability. However, the vocabulary is rich and appropriate, so despite the errors, the fluency isn't terrible. Maybe a 3 or 4? Let me check more.

For Coherence: The structure seems logical, moving from introduction to character analysis. However, there are abrupt jumps, like transitioning from discussing Dickens' health to analyzing characters without clear connections. Some sections feel repetitive, like repeated mentions of opium use without clear progression. The dramatis personae section is detailed but disrupts the flow when it appears after the introduction. Also, the shift from Andrew Lang's preface to "The Story" chapter feels a bit disconnected. The ideas are mostly connected, but the transitions could be smoother. Maybe a 3 for coherence?

Wait, but the story is non-fiction, an analysis. So coherence might be about how the arguments and points are structured. The author jumps between historical context, character analysis, and personal theories. There's some repetition in emphasizing Jasper's character. The structure is mostly clear but could be more cohesive. Maybe Coherence is a 3, Fluency a 3 as well due to errors but overall manageable flow.

Issues: 
- Grammatical errors (e.g., "he certainly write," "how coulded he hoped," inconsistent verb tenses).
- Word choice inconsistencies (e.g., "unlooked-for sallies," overly formal tone in dialogue descriptions).
- Punctuation errors (missing articles, awkward phrasing in long sentences).
- Abrupt transitions between historical context, character analysis, and authorial theories.
- Repetitive emphasis on opium use and Jasper’s character without clear narrative progression.
- Disruptive placement of "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" mid-narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
