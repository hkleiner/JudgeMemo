Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and archaic. There are some grammatical errors, like "was" instead of "were" in a few places. For example, "a blind consent is blindly give" should be "given". Also, "the point was supposed to had been settle" has a tense issue. These mistakes might disrupt the flow, but the overall structure of sentences is mostly clear despite being complex. The vocabulary is appropriate but old-fashioned, which might affect readability for modern readers.

Now, coherence. The structure is logical, starting with an introduction that sets the objective, then moving into Chapter I with a clear topic. The author outlines the controversy, presents different viewpoints (Rome vs. Church of England vs. Reformation principles), and then refers to the Church's documents. The transition from discussing Scripture to examining the Church's Articles is smooth. However, the text is densely packed with theological concepts without much explanation for someone unfamiliar. There's some repetition, like reiterating the distinction between the sacrament and spiritual feeding, but it's used for emphasis rather than being redundant. The main points are well-connected, but the depth of discussion might make it hard to follow without background knowledge.

For Fluency Score: Despite the errors, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are noticeable but not overwhelming. Maybe a 4?

For Coherence Score: The structure is clear, topics are well-linked, but the complexity and assumed knowledge might reduce coherence for some readers. Still, the author's progression is logical. Maybe a 4 as well, but need to check if the assumed background affects coherence. Since coherence is about the narrative's clarity and flow, the technical terms and dense argumentation might lower it a bit. Maybe 4 is still okay because the author guides the reader through the steps even if the content is complex.

Issues: 
- **Fluency**: Scattered grammatical errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were," "had been settle"), archaic phrasing ("blinded give," "am existed"), and overly complex sentence structures. 
- **Coherence**: Assumes significant theological background, dense argumentation, and repetitive clarifications of distinctions (e.g., sacramental vs. spiritual feeding) that slow pacing. Transitions between Scripture, Church doctrine, and polemical points are logical but opaque to non-experts.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
