Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully and then evaluate it based on Coherence and Fluency.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the language and structure. There are some archaic terms and spellings, like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "princopak" (probably principle), "locayion" (location), "cohsequently" (consequently), "admirirg" (admiring), "dkscovered" (discovered), "scientest" (scientist), "inhabitant" (maybe inhabitant is correct, but context matters), "Bridtish" (British), "scwttered" (scattered), "jt" (it), "wlmost" (almost), "endkess" (endless). These typos or old spellings might affect fluency. Also, sentence structure is complex and long, which can make it hard to follow. However, considering the period, maybe some leniency is needed. But the task is to rate as per modern standards? The criteria mention grammar, spelling, etc., so probably modern standards apply. So, lots of errors here. Fluency score might be lower, like 2 or 3.

For Coherence: The story has a clear thesis—the author claims to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location. The structure starts with introduction, biblical references, description of the location, and then detailed geography. However, there are abrupt jumps, like moving from biblical discussion to personal discovery without clear transitions. Repetitions, such as emphasizing the beauty and the rivers multiple times. Also, some parts feel like they're meandering, like the part about Trempealeau's town site and the greed of proprietors. The connection between that anecdote and the main point isn't clear. There's also a shift from geological description to talking about snakes and then Christians eliminating them, which feels a bit disjointed. The narrative tries to link everything back to Eden, but some sections don't flow smoothly into others. So coherence might be a 3 or 4. Need to weigh the clarity of the overall argument versus the disjointed sections.

Balancing both: Fluency is definitely lower due to errors. Coherence has a clear overall structure but with some weaknesses in transitions and repetition. So maybe Fluency: 2, Coherence: 3.

Issues: 
- Numerous archaic spellings and grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "princopak", "cohsequently", "dkscovered").
- Complex, overly long sentences hindering readability.
- Repetitive emphasis on the location’s beauty without clear transitions.
- Abrupt shifts (e.g., discussing town greed, snake eradication) disrupting narrative flow.
- Some ideas (e.g., Trempealeau’s history) feel tangential to the central claim.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
