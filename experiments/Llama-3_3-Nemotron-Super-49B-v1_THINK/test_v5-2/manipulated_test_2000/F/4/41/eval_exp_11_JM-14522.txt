Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, using a 1-5 scale. First, I need to read through the story carefully. The story is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, but there are typos and errors in the provided text. 

Starting with Fluency: The main issues here are the numerous typos like "seej" instead of "seen", "wdll" for "well", "ofteb" for "often", "xven" for "seven", "delicate withvthe" missing a space, "tuey" instead of "they", "fsw" for "few", "finebfreedom" should be "freedom", "xnd" for "and", "guarfians" for "guardians", "waw" for "was", "akl" for "all", "nonsensd" for "nonsense", "simce" for "since", "afger" for "after", "reavhed" for "reached", "Yhe" for "The", "evwrything" for "everything", "librwry" for "library", "Myerw" for "Myers", etc. These typos disrupt the smooth reading. However, the original story's fluency is good, but the errors here affect the score. So Fluency would be lower due to the mistakes.

For Coherence: The story structure is logical, following the Otis family moving in, encountering the ghost, and their reactions. Each chapter connects well, building up the ghost's appearances and the family's skepticism turning into interaction. There's a clear progression and no major jumps or ambiguities. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistent. So Coherence should be high.

Now, listing the issues in bullet points for Fluency: typos, grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes. For Coherence, maybe none major, but perhaps the transition between chapters or some minor repetitions, but overall coherent.

Wait, the user's story has many typos, which are not in the original. So the annotator is grading the provided text as given, not the original. So Fluency is badly affected by all the spelling and grammar errors. Coherence remains good because the structure is intact despite the typos.

So final scores: Fluency 2 (because despite good original structure, the errors are plentiful), Coherence 5 (since the narrative flow and logic are strong).

Issues: 
- Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xven", "fsw", "tuey", "finebfreedom", "xnd", "guarfians", "waw", "akl", "nonsensd", "simce", "afger", "reavhed", "Yhe", "evwrything", "librwry", "Myerw").
- Grammatical and punctuation errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb forms).
- Minor inconsistencies in formatting (e.g., inconsistent spacing, capitalization).

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
