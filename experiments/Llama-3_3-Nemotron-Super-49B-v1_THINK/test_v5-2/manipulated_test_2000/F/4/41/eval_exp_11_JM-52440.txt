Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria again. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., making sure the text flows smoothly. Coherence is about the overall structure, logical sequence, connections between ideas, and avoiding ambiguities.

Looking at the provided story, it's a theological text, part of a book or treatise. The language is formal, maybe from the 19th century given the style. Let's start with Fluency. Checking for grammar and spelling errors. I notice some typos like "best-establisjed" (should be "best-established"), "unvommon" (uncommon), "as ifmthey" (as if they), "srrvice" (service), "businesbis" (business is), "tue" (the), "prssent" (present), "wnd" (and), "vorb" (probably "of" or a typo), "ctwo" (two), "witheout" (without), "localised" (localized, but could be British spelling), "collaterl" (collateral), "writeds" (writings), "tp" (to), "pleae" (please), "hexven" (heaven), "tye" (the), "mommentn" (moment). These are quite a few typos, which affects fluency. Also, word choice is mostly appropriate but very formal. Phrasing is sometimes awkward due to archaic style, like "it is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." The structure of sentences is mostly clear, but some are long and complex, which might make flow a bit choppy. So Fluency score might be 3 because of the errors and some awkward phrasing, but the overall structure is manageable.

Now Coherence. The text is well-structured with chapters and clear headings. The introduction sets up the topic, states the objective, and outlines the approach. Each part connects logically: discussing the Real Presence, contrasting with Rome and the Reformation view, then examining Church documents. The author uses transitional phrases and references to Scripture and Church documents to support points. However, there's some repetition, like reiterating the importance of examining the Church's own documents. Also, the shift from theological discussion to the state of the Church might feel a bit abrupt, but it's contextual. The arguments are logically sequenced, and the author clearly distinguishes between different doctrines. So Coherence is strong, maybe a 4. The only deductions are for minor repetitions and one slight abruptness, but overall very coherent.

Issues: 
- Multiple spelling and typographical errors (e.g., "best-establisjed", "unvommon", "srrvice", "wnd", "localised").
- Archaisms and overly formal phrasing may disrupt modern readability.
- Repetitive emphasis on examining Church documents without immediate transition.
- Minor ambiguities in sentence structure due to length and complexity.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
