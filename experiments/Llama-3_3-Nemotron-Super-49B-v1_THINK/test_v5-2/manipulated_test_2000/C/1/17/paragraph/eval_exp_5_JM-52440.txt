Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to read the story carefully and identify the issues in both criteria.

Looking at the story, it seems like there are multiple parts that don't connect well. The beginning starts with a dialogue about loss and talent, then jumps to a chapter introduction with characters like Jasper, Sapsea, and Durdles. Then it shifts abruptly to a religious discussion about the Church of England and the Real Presence doctrine. After that, there's a part about a ghost story with the Otis family, and finally a scene with George Stransom reacting to Kate Creston. These sections are completely unrelated. That's a big coherence issue because the narrative isn't structured logically; each part seems like a different story or genre.

For Fluency, I need to check grammar, syntax, word choice, etc. The religious section is formal and uses complex theological terms, which might be clear to experts but could be confusing otherwise. The ghost story part has some clarity but feels disconnected. The last part about George Stransom has smoother language but again, the overall flow is disrupted by the unrelated sections. There might be some awkward phrasing, like in the transition between chapters or the sudden shifts without connectors.

So, Coherence is really poor because the story lacks a unified narrative. It's like multiple unrelated texts pasted together. Each section on its own might be coherent, but together they jump around too much. Fluency varies; some parts are well-written, others are dense or have complex vocabulary, but the main fluency issue is the disjointedness affecting the overall flow.

I should list the issues in bullet points. For Coherence: abrupt jumps between unrelated scenes, lack of narrative connection, multiple genres/topics without transition. For Fluency: varying writing styles, possible awkwardness in transitions, complex vocabulary in some parts.

Scoring: Coherence is probably a 1 because it's severely fragmented. Fluency might be a 3 since some parts are fluent but the overall flow is bad due to the structure.

Issues: 
- The narrative abruptly shifts between unrelated scenes (e.g., dialogue about loss, religious tract, ghost story, character introspection) without logical connection or transitions.
- Multiple genres/topics (theological debate, Gothic horror, character drama) coexist without thematic coherence.
- Lack of a unified storyline or character continuity across sections.
- Varying writing styles (formal theological language, conversational dialogue, introspective prose) disrupt consistency.
- Some sections rely on dense, specialized vocabulary (e.g., "real objective presence," "sacramental appointment") that may impede smooth reading for non-expert audiences.

FINAL Coherence Score: 1  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
