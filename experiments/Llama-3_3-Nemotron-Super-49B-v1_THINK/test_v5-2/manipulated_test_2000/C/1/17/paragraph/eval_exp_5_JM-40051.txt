Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale. First, I need to read the story carefully and identify issues for each criterion.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Looking through the text, there are some archaic terms like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians), "admirirg" (should be admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "Bridtish" (British), "consitutes" (constitutes), and "quaint, old-fashioned manner" which might be intentional but still stands out. Also, punctuation seems mostly okay, but some long sentences could affect flow. For example, the sentence starting "When God made man..." is quite long and convoluted. 

Now Coherence. The story seems to jump around a lot. There's a part about the Garden of Eden location, then a sudden shift to a narrative about Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin, which doesn't connect to the previous biblical discussion. Later, there's a scene with Mrs. Umney and Canterville Chase, which is completely unrelated. Then a office partition story, and finally a passage about George Stransom and Kate Creston. These sections are disjointed; there's no clear narrative thread linking them. The transitions are abrupt, making the story hard to follow. The author tries to link the Garden of Eden to a specific location but then inserts unrelated characters and settings without explanation.

So for Fluency, despite some typos and word choices, the language is mostly understandable, though a bit formal and old-fashioned. The errors are noticeable but not overwhelming. Maybe a 3 or 4? Considering the typos and some awkward phrasing, maybe 3.

For Coherence, the biggest issue is the lack of connection between sections. Multiple unrelated narratives make the story incoherent. The main topic of Eden is interrupted by unrelated scenes. So Coherence score would be very low, probably 1 or 2. Since there's no logical flow and abrupt jumps, 1 seems fitting.

Wait, but the first part about Eden has its own coherence within that section, but the overall story combines unrelated parts. So the entire text as a story lacks coherence, hence very low. Fluency has issues but is mostly readable. So FINAL Coherence: 1, Fluency: 3.

Issues: 
- Multiple unrelated narrative segments (Garden of Eden theory, Jasper/Rosa story, office partition anecdote, George Stransom passage) with no cohesive connection.
- Abrupt transitions between disjointed scenes.
- Typographical/spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "scientest," "Bridtish").
- Archaic language and inconsistent tone (formal biblical analysis vs. modern character drama).
- Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man...").

FINAL Coherence Score: 1  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
