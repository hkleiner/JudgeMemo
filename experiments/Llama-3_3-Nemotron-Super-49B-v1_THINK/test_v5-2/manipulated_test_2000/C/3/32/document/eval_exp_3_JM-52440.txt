Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using a Likert scale of 1-5. First, I need to understand the criteria properly. 

Starting with Fluency: This is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation, and smooth flow. The text provided is from an older style, probably 19th century given the language and structure. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability but not necessarily fluency in terms of errors. I need to check for any grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, or punctuation errors. The text uses archaic terms like "IT is" capitalized, which was common then. No obvious errors spotted here; the language is formal and consistent with its time. So Fluency might be high, maybe 5.

Next, Coherence: This looks at the overall structure, logical sequence, connections between ideas, absence of repetition or abrupt jumps. The text is structured with chapters and clear headings. The introduction sets up the topic, states the objective, and outlines the approach. Chapter I delves into the Real Presence, contrasting views, and then examines Church documents (Articles, etc.). The flow seems logical: problem statement, methodology, analysis of sources. However, the discussion is dense and assumes some background knowledge on the theological topics, which might make it less clear for non-experts. There's a clear progression from stating the issue to analyzing church documents. I don't see abrupt jumps or major repetitions. The author uses transitional phrases and signposts ("Now it would be strange indeed..."), which help coherence. So Coherence might also be high, perhaps 5.

Wait, but the user might expect some deductions. Let me check again. For Fluency: Are there any awkward phrasings? The sentence structure is complex but correct. Maybe some word choices are outdated but not incorrect. Fluency is about how smoothly it reads despite that. Since there are no errors, Fluency is 5.

For Coherence: The structure is clear, each part builds on the previous. The author defines terms, states the problem, outlines the method, and starts analyzing. The connection between chapters is logical. However, the text is heavily theological and dense, which might affect clarity for some readers, but coherence is about internal logical structure, not accessibility. So Coherence is also 5.

But wait, the user might have different expectations. Let me think again. Are there any points where the narrative jumps or lacks connection? The transition from discussing Scripture to examining Church documents is clear. The author signals each step. Maybe the only issue is the assumption of prior knowledge, but that's not a coherence problem per the criteria. So both scores are 5.

Issues: 
- Dense, archaic language may impede readability for modern readers.
- Assumes significant theological background, potentially limiting clarity for non-experts.
- Extended sentences and complex structures require careful parsing.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
