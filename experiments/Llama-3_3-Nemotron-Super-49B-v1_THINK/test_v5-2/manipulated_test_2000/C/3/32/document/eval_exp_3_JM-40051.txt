Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale of 1-5. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify issues under each criterion.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is archaic. Words like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians), "thing" repeated oddly, and "admirirg" (admiring) stand out. There are grammatical errors like missing articles, inconsistent punctuation, and awkward phrasing. For example, "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is confusing. Also, "scientest" should be scientist. These errors disrupt the flow.

Now, Coherence. The narrative jumps around a lot. The author switches between biblical references, personal discovery, geographical descriptions, and modern elements without clear transitions. The structure is meandering; for instance, the shift from discussing the Garden's location to talking about Trempealeau's town site feels abrupt. There's repetition, like emphasizing the beauty of the location multiple times. The claim about the Garden's location isn't logically built up; it feels assumed rather than argued. Also, some parts are unclear, like the "stuff" references which seem like placeholders or errors.

So for Fluency, despite the historical context, the numerous errors and awkwardness would lower the score. Maybe a 2 because while it's mostly understandable, the mistakes are frequent.

For Coherence, the lack of clear structure, abrupt transitions, and unconnected ideas make it hard to follow. The repetition and assumptions without evidence also hurt. So Coherence might be a 3, as there's some logical flow in parts but overall it's disjointed.

Issues: 
- **Fluency**: Frequent grammatical/spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "scientest," "admirirg"), archaic language, inconsistent punctuation, awkward phrasing ("the thing"), and repetitive word choices ("stuff"). 
- **Coherence**: Abrupt narrative jumps (e.g., biblical theory to local geography), repetitive emphasis on beauty without logical progression, unclear transitions, and unexplained placeholders ("stuff"). 

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
