Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story's Coherence and Fluency based on the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. 

Starting with Fluency: The story is mostly well-written. The sentences are structured correctly, grammar seems okay, and the vocabulary is appropriate. However, there are some placeholders like "a thing" and "stuff" which are probably placeholders that weren't replaced. Those would disrupt the flow and cause confusion. For example, in the line "Lord the thing, smiling," "the thing" doesn't make sense. Also, "a stuff Street" and "the stuff drawl" are unclear. These errors affect Fluency because they make the reader pause and wonder what's meant. But overall, the rest of the text flows smoothly without major errors, so Fluency might be a 4, deducting for the placeholders.

Now Coherence: The story unfolds logically. Each chapter connects to the next. The introduction of the ghost, the family's reaction, and the events follow a clear sequence. There's no abrupt jumps or repetitions. The characters' actions make sense in context. However, the part where the twins throw a pillow seems a bit sudden. It's mentioned they're called "The Star and Stripes" because they get swished, implying they're mischievous, so their action is somewhat justified, but the transition could be smoother. Also, Mrs. Umney's warning and the family's dismissal are consistent with their skeptical character. So Coherence is strong, maybe a 5, but maybe a 4 if the pillow incident feels too abrupt. But overall, the narrative is well-structured.

So final scores: Fluency 4 (due to placeholders), Coherence 5.

Issues: 
- Placeholder terms ("a thing", "stuff") disrupt clarity and consistency in multiple instances.
- Minor abruptness in the introduction of the twins' action with the pillow (lacks seamless transition).

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
