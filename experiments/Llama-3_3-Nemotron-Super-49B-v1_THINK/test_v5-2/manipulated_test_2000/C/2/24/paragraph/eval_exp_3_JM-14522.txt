Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency, then provide scores. First, I need to read through the story carefully. 

Starting with fluency: The text seems mostly smooth. It's a classic style, probably from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost." But there are some anachronisms. For example, a hologram, Bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera are mentioned. Those are modern elements in a 19th-century setting. That's jarring. Also, terms like "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover" and "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" might be authentic for the time, but the mix with modern tech disrupts fluency. Grammar and syntax are good otherwise.

Now coherence: The story structure is logical, following the Otis family's encounter with the ghost. However, the sudden appearance of modern devices (hologram, Bluetooth, camera) breaks the narrative's historical consistency. These feel like errors or intentional additions that don't fit. Also, when the ghost appears, the twins' intervention with a pillow seems a bit abrupt, but it's comic relief, so maybe intentional. The main issue is the inconsistency in time period elements, which affects coherence.

So for issues: Fluency problems due to anachronistic terms, coherence issues from inconsistent time setting. 

Scores: Fluency might be a 4 because the language is mostly fluent but marred by those errors. Coherence a 3 because the story mostly flows but the anachronisms cause disruptions.

Issues: 
- Anachronistic elements (hologram, Bluetooth signal, surveillance camera) disrupt historical consistency.
- Abrupt introduction of modern technology in a 19th-century narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
