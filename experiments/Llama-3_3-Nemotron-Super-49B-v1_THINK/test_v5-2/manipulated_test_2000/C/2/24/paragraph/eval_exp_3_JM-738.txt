Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues related to those two metrics.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The story seems to be a literary analysis or a scholarly piece about Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The language is formal and uses complex vocabulary, which is appropriate for the topic. I notice some long, intricate sentences that might make reading a bit challenging, but they're structured correctly. There are no obvious grammatical errors or typos that I can spot. The word choice is good, and punctuation seems correct. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 5. But wait, some sentences are quite dense and convoluted. For example, the part about Princess Puffer's timeline might confuse readers. That could deduct a point. So maybe Fluency is 4.

Now Coherence. This looks at how well the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, no abrupt jumps. The text starts with an introduction about Dickens' plot construction, then dives into the analysis of "Edwin Drood" characters and plot points. The structure is clear: introduction, dramatis personae, opening of the tale. However, there are a lot of detailed character relationships and backstory that might be hard to follow without prior knowledge of the novel. The transitions between sections are logical, but the depth of detail could make it hard for some readers to keep track. Also, the inclusion of real authors (Andrew Lang, Mr. Proctor, etc.) and their theories might disrupt the flow for those not familiar. There's a mention of "The Signalman" which feels a bit abrupt. So Coherence might be a 3 or 4. The main issue is the complexity and assuming reader knowledge, leading to potential confusion. Also, the story stops abruptly with "A livestream began recording." which seems out of place. That's a problem. So maybe Coherence is 3 because of that abrupt end and the dense information.

Wait, the story provided seems to cut off mid-sentence: "A livestream began recording." That's definitely an issue. It's an abrupt jump, disrupting coherence. So that's a major point deduction for Coherence. Also, the text mixes analysis with the dramatis personae and scene descriptions, which might not be fully connected smoothly. The transitions between the introduction and the character list could be better. So Coherence score might be 3. Fluency, despite some complex sentences, is mostly good except for the cutoff, but Fluency is more about the language quality. The cutoff affects Coherence more. So final scores: Coherence 3, Fluency 4.

Issues: 
- Abrupt, incomplete ending ("A livestream began recording.") disrupts narrative flow.
- Overly dense, complex sentences may hinder smooth reading experience.
- Assumes reader familiarity with Dickens’ works and historical context without clear integration.
- Minor ambiguity in character relationships (e.g., Princess Puffer’s timeline, Jasper’s motivations).

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
