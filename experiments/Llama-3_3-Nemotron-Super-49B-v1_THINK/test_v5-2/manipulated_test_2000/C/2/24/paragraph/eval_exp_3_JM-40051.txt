Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden near the Mississippi River, specifically between La Crosse and Winona. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is old-fashioned, probably from the 19th century given the language and references. There are some archaic terms like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians), "scientest" (scientist), and "admirirg" (admiring). Also, punctuation seems inconsistentâ€”long sentences, missing commas, or extra ones. For example, "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism." The "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" part is odd formatting. Spelling errors like "admirirg" and "scinetest". Word choice is formal but sometimes awkward, like "sensibly impressed by a suggestion". 

Now Coherence. The structure is a bit meandering. The author jumps between biblical references, personal anecdotes, geographical descriptions, and defensive comments about critics. There's repetition, like mentioning the location multiple times without adding new info. The transition from discussing the garden's features to talking about snakes feels abrupt. Also, the conclusion about Christians eradicating snakes isn't clearly connected. The argument relies heavily on the author's personal impressions rather than logical evidence, making the narrative less coherent.

For Fluency, despite the challenges, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely hinder understanding. So maybe a 3? 

Coherence suffers more from the disjointed structure and lack of clear progression. The ideas aren't well-linked, and there's repetition. So Coherence might be a 2 or 3. Wait, but the author does try to connect biblical descriptions with the location, even if not very effectively. Maybe a 3 for Coherence as well? Or 2 because the structure is really disjointed. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the criteria again. Coherence needs logical sequence, smooth connections, no ambiguities. This text has abrupt jumps (like the snake part), repetitive assertions (location details repeated), and assumptions without clear links (e.g., why this spot fits better). So maybe Coherence is 2. Fluency has errors but is still fluent in a formal, old way. So Fluency 3.

Yes, that makes sense. So Issues would list the specific problems under each category. For Fluency: archaic language, spelling errors, inconsistent punctuation. For Coherence: meandering structure, repetition, abrupt transitions, lack of logical flow.

Issues: 
- Fluency: Archaic language and formatting (e.g., "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT"), spelling errors ("admirirg", "scientest"), inconsistent punctuation, and overly formal phrasing.
- Coherence: Meandering narrative structure, repetitive location descriptions, abrupt transitions (e.g., shift to discussing snakes), and weak logical connections between biblical interpretations and geographical claims.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
