Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using a Likert scale of 1-5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria properly.

Starting with Fluency: This involves syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation, and smooth flow. The story is from the late 19th or early 20th century, given the style and language. I notice some archaic terms like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "scietest" (scientist), and "Bridtish" (British). There are also long, complex sentences which might make reading cumbersome. However, despite these, the text is mostly readable. The main issues here are the typos and somewhat outdated vocabulary, but overall, the structure is coherent in terms of sentence flow. So Fluency might be a 3 or 4. Let me check again: the typos are minor but present, and the sentence structure, while complex, is generally correct. Maybe 4 because the errors are noticeable but don't severely hinder understanding.

Now Coherence: This looks at the overall narrative structure, logical sequence, connections between ideas, and absence of ambiguities. The story starts with the author's discovery claim, then dives into biblical references, geographical descriptions, and comparisons. There's a clear progression from introduction to evidence presentation. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing the garden's location to talking about the town site of Trempealeau feels a bit abrupt. Also, the inclusion of specific details like the number of rattlesnakes killed might disrupt the flow slightly. The author's points are mostly logical, connecting the biblical Eden with the described location, but some parts feel like tangents (e.g., the greed of proprietors). Despite this, the overall argument is clear. Coherence score might be 4, deducting for some abrupt transitions and minor tangents.

Wait, let me re-examine. The story has a clear thesis and supports it with various points (location, river names, moral aspects), but the flow between these points could be better. The part about Trempealeau's development history might not be essential and could be seen as a detour. However, the author ties it back to the garden's features. So maybe Coherence is still a 4. 

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (some errors but manageable), Coherence 4 (mostly logical but some minor issues in transitions and tangents).

Issues: 
- Minor typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "scietest," "Bridtish") and archaic phrasing (e.g., "as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large").
- Occasionally cumbersome sentence structure due to length and complexity.
- Mild abruptness in transitions (e.g., shift from biblical analysis to Trempealeauâ€™s history).
- Tangential details (e.g., rattlesnake anecdote, townsite critique) slightly disrupt focus.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
