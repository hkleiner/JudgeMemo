Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the specified criteria. First, I need to read through both chapters carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems mostly well-written. I notice some long sentences, like in the first chapter where the author talks about European artists. Those might be a bit hard to follow, but they're not grammatically incorrect. There's also some archaic language, like "corn-fed American" or "pious ambition," which might affect modern readability but isn't an error. Punctuation looks good overall, but there are a few places with multiple short sentences in a row, like in the second chapter's descriptions of the boy's daily life. That could make the flow a bit choppy, but it's intentional for the narrative voice.

Now Coherence. The story has two distinct chapters. The first is an introduction to Will Bradley's impact, and the second is a biographical sketch of his early life. The connection between the chapters is clear—they both focus on Bradley. However, the shift from discussing his artistic influence to his childhood might feel a bit abrupt without a transitional paragraph. Within each chapter, the ideas are logically sequenced. The first chapter builds up his significance, and the second chapter follows his growth chronologically. There's no repetition or ambiguity noted. The only possible issue is the abrupt chapter transition, but each chapter is coherent on its own.

For Fluency, despite some lengthy sentences and old-fashioned terms, the language is fluent. The main deduction would be for the sentence structure variability causing slight awkwardness. So maybe a 4.

For Coherence, the overall structure is good, but the lack of a clear link between chapters might deduct a point. So also a 4.

Wait, let me check again. Are there any ambiguities? In the second chapter, some scenes like the faker selling soap might not be fully explained, but it's part of the setting. The coherence within each chapter is strong. The only real issue is the chapter transition. So Coherence could be 4. Fluency also 4 due to some sentence flow issues but no major errors.

Issues: 
- Occasional long, dense sentences (e.g., first chapter’s European art movements paragraph) may impede smooth reading.
- Abrupt transition between chapters without explicit narrative bridge.
- Some colloquial/archaic terms (e.g., “corn-fed,” “picklelime”) and repetitive simple sentences (e.g., second chapter’s daily routines) affect modern fluency.
- Minor ambiguity in unresolved subplots (e.g., the faker scene’s purpose).

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
