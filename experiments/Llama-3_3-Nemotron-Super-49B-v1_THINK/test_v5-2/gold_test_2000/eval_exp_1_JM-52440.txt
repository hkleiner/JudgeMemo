Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria.

Starting with Fluency: I need to check for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and archaic. Words like "whilst," "thou," and longer sentences might affect readability but aren't errors. I'll look for any actual grammatical mistakes. Scanning through, the sentences are complex but structured correctly. No obvious spelling or punctuation errors. Maybe some awkward phrasing due to the period, but that's expected. So Fluency is probably high, maybe 5.

Now Coherence: How the ideas flow, logical sequence, no ambiguities. The text is a theological argument. The introduction sets up the topic, then Chapter I breaks down the Real Presence. The author outlines the controversy, cites Scripture, contrasts Roman and Anglican views, then examines Church documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.). The structure is clear: problem statement, methodology, analysis of sources. Each part connects logically. However, the text is dense and assumes knowledge of theological terms. Are there abrupt jumps? The transition from discussing Scripture to analyzing the Articles seems smooth. The author signals each step ("The Articles.â€”There are seven Articles..."). Repetition might be an issue; for example, reiterating the distinction between the sacrament and spiritual feeding. But it's used for emphasis rather than unnecessary repetition. Coherence is strong, but the density and assumptions might slightly impact clarity for some readers. Maybe a 4 for Coherence because while structured well, it's complex and not easily accessible to all.

Issues to list: For Fluency, maybe archaic language affecting flow, but that's not a deduction since it's stylistic. For Coherence, perhaps the assumed background knowledge and some repetitive explanations, but overall well-structured. So the main issues might be the complexity and some repetition, but not major flaws.

Issues: 
- Archaisms and lengthy sentence structures may impede modern readability (Fluency).
- Assumes significant theological background knowledge, potentially limiting accessibility (Coherence).
- Some repetitive clarifications (e.g., distinguishing spiritual/material food) for emphasis.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
