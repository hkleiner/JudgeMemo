Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by recalling the criteria. 

Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. It should flow smoothly without errors. Coherence is about the structure of the story, logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, clear progression, no ambiguities or jumps.

Looking at the story, it's a biography of Will Bradley structured in chapters. The writing style is quite formal, almost vintage, which might be intentional given the subject's era. 

First, checking for Fluency. The text is mostly well-structured with proper grammar and punctuation. However, there are some archaic expressions and long, complex sentences that might make it a bit hard to follow. For example, sentences like "Recognized now as a period of over-ornamentation and bad taste, the Nineties were nevertheless years of leisurely contacts, kindly advice and an appreciative pat on the back by an employer, and certainly a friendly bohemianism seldom known in the rush and drive of today." These are grammatically correct but dense. Also, some words like "was" instead of "were" in a few places, but those might be minor typos. 

For Coherence, the story is chronological and each chapter builds on the previous one. The structure is clear, moving from Bradley's childhood to his career milestones. However, the chapters are quite long and dense. There's a lot of detailed information which, while coherent in sequence, might feel overwhelming or repetitive in some parts. For instance, the list of projects and jobs he took might benefit from more varied pacing. Also, the transition between chapters could be smoother, but overall, the narrative flows logically.

Potential issues for Fluency: Some sentence complexity, minor typos (e.g., "was" instead of "were"), and outdated language that might affect readability. 

For Coherence: The main issue is the density of information and possibly too much detail in some sections, which could make the narrative feel a bit dry or slow, but the overall structure is logical.

Scoring: 

Fluency: Maybe 4. The text is mostly fluent but has some complexity and minor errors. 

Coherence: Also 4. The structure is sound, but the density and some repetitive listing of achievements might deduct a point.

Issues: 
- Occasionally dense, complex sentences impacting readability.
- Minor grammatical slips (e.g., "was" instead of "were").
- Archaisms and lengthy paragraphs may disrupt flow for modern readers.
- Repetitive listing of projects in later chapters slightly disrupts pacing.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
