Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. I also have to list the issues in bullet points.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. However, there are no obvious grammatical errors, correct punctuation, and proper structure. The vocabulary is rich but appropriate for the theological topic. Despite the complexity, the language flows smoothly once you get used to the style. So Fluency might be high, maybe 4 or 5. But considering the modern reader might find it challenging due to length and complexity, perhaps a 4.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and logical progression. The author builds an argument step by step, referencing church documents in a systematic way. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), leading to a conclusion. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the author signals what they're about to discuss. However, the text is dense and assumes background knowledge of theological debates, which might make it hard for non-experts to follow. But within its context, it's well-structured. Coherence is strong, so maybe a 5.

Issues for Fluency: Archaisms, very long sentences, complex vocabulary. But no errors.

Issues for Coherence: Assumes prior knowledge, dense material, but logically structured.

So final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 5.

Issues: 
- Archaisms and overly formal, dense language may impede readability for modern readers.
- Extremely long, complex sentences requiring careful parsing.
- Assumes extensive background knowledge of theological debates and Church of England documents.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
