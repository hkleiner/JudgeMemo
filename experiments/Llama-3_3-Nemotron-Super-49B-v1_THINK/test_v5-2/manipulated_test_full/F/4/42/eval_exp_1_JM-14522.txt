Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, word choice, etc. Coherence is about the overall structure, logical flow, consistency, and how ideas connect.

Looking at the story, it's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I know this is a classic, so the writing style is from the late 19th century. That might affect fluency for modern readers, but since the task is to evaluate based on the given criteria without considering period, I should focus on technical aspects.

For Fluency: The text has complex sentences, which might make it less fluent for some, but they are grammatically correct. There's some archaic language (e.g., "whilst", "thou"), but no major errors. Word choice is rich and appropriate. Punctuation seems correct. So Fluency score might be high, maybe 5.

Coherence: The story unfolds logically. Each chapter builds on the previous, introducing the ghost, interactions, and resolution. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistent. The prophecy in Chapter V ties into the ending. However, some scenes might feel a bit disconnected, like the ghost's various attempts, but they contribute to the comedic build-up. The narrative is well-structured, so Coherence is also high, probably 5.

Wait, but the user might expect some deductions. Let me check for any issues. Are there repetitive ideas? The ghost's failed attempts could be seen as repetitive, but they serve the comedic purpose. Any ambiguities? The ending with Virginia and the ghost is clear once you understand the prophecy. The story flows well, so maybe no major issues. Thus, both scores 5.

Issues: 
- Slightly archaic language and complex sentence structures may impede modern readability.
- Repetitive comedic confrontations between the ghost and the Otis family could slightly disrupt narrative variety.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
