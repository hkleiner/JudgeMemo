Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on the given criteria for Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by recalling what each criterion means.

Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. So I need to check for errors in these areas and see if the language flows well.

Coherence looks at how the story unfolds as a whole. It should have logically sequenced ideas, be non-repetitive, smoothly connected, avoid ambiguities, and have a clear structure. 

The story provided is a biography of Will Bradley, structured in chapters. Let me read through the story to identify issues.

First, Fluency. Scanning the text, I notice some typos like "AN INTEODUCTION" (should be Introduction), "ghe" (the), "dtartling" (startling), "aplw" (apart), "sjoes" (shoes), "tlme" (time), "idda" (idea), "yrul" (your), "movjes" (movies), "q few" (a few), "mvtal" (metal), "neltow" (below), "temzture" (temperature), "thd" (the), "strret" (street), "importznt" (important), "exhange" (exchange), "thys" (this), "ks" (as), "necessitating" (probably a typo but not sure), "Cokonial" (Colonial), "casring" (casting), "fynances" (finances), "broke under the strain and had to go away for a complete rest" (seems like a sentence fragment), "q" (a), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "thys" (this), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a), "vnd" (and), "qnd" (and), "vnd" (and), "q" (a),
