Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale of 1-5. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll have to skim parts but make sure I understand the structure and content.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is from the 19th century, judging by the language and style. There are some archaic terms and sentence structures, but that's expected. However, I notice several typos and grammatical errors. For example, "thr earth" instead of "the earth", "tje" instead of "the", "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "giving tje antldiluvians" (repeated typo), "discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it" (maybe a comma splice). These errors disrupt the flow. Also, the sentence structure is often complex and verbose, which might make it hard to follow for modern readers. Despite the historical context, the sheer number of typos and minor errors would affect the fluency score. I'd probably give Fluency a 3 because while it's mostly understandable, the errors and outdated style hinder smooth reading.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the story holds together as a whole, logical sequence, connections between ideas, no abrupt jumps, etc. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Midwest, specifically between La Crosse and Winona. The structure starts with an introduction, then biblical references, description of the location, comparison with other proposed Edens, testimonials, and concludes with invitations to visit. However, the text jumps around a lot. For example, after describing the location, it suddenly talks about Dr. Warren's North Pole theory, then moves to geological points, then back to biblical quotes, and includes unrelated elements like the dairy products awards. There's a lot of repetition, especially in describing the scenery and emphasizing its beauty. The author also inserts personal anecdotes and debates with critics, which might disrupt the flow. The logical connection between some paragraphs isn't clear. Despite a clear overall thesis, the execution is meandering and repetitive. So Coherence might be a 2 or 3. Considering the meandering and lack of tight structure, maybe a 2, but since the main idea is somewhat consistent, perhaps a 3.

Wait, but the user's criteria mention "logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas". The text has significant repetition (e.g., multiple descriptions of the view, repeated invitations to "come and see"), and the sequence isn't very logicalâ€”jumps between different topics without clear transitions. So Coherence is definitely lower. Maybe 2.

Finalizing: Fluency 3 (due to errors but understandable with effort), Coherence 2 (due to poor structure, repetition, jumps).

Issues: 
- Numerous typos and grammatical errors (e.g., "thr earth," "tje," "antldiluvians," inconsistent punctuation).
- Overly verbose and archaic sentence structures hinder modern readability.
- Repetitive descriptions of scenery and defensive asides disrupt coherence.
- Abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, geography, and personal anecdotes.
- Lack of logical sequencing (e.g., sudden shifts to dairy statistics, geological age debates).

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
