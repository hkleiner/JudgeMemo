Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency. First, I'll read through the story to understand its structure and content.

The story is a theological treatise examining whether the Church of England teaches the Doctrine of the Real Presence. It's divided into chapters and discusses various documents like Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies. The author argues that the Church of England does not support the Real Presence, using evidence from these documents.

Starting with Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical sequencing, non-repetition, smooth connections, avoidance of ambiguities, and structural consistency. The text is well-structured with clear chapters (Introduction, Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect, building on the previous one. The author methodically examines each document, drawing conclusions step by step. There's a clear progression from introducing the topic to analyzing each source and concluding the Church's stance. The arguments are logically sequenced, and the author connects each part to the overall thesis. However, the text is quite lengthy and dense, with long paragraphs that might make it hard to follow for some readers. There's some repetition in emphasizing the distinction between the sign and the thing signified, but it's used for emphasis rather than unnecessary redundancy. The structure is consistent, using authoritative documents in order. Overall, coherence is strong, but the density might slightly affect it. Maybe a 4 here.

Next, Fluency. Fluency concerns syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation, and smooth flow. The text is written in formal, somewhat archaic English (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing...", "whomsoever"), which is appropriate for a theological treatise from the 19th century (given the references to Edward VI's Prayer Books). Grammar and syntax are correct; sentences are complex but properly structured. There are no spelling or punctuation errors noticed. Word choice is precise, using terms like "transubstantiation" and "consubstantiation" correctly. The flow is smooth despite the formality. However, the archaic style might make it less fluent for modern readers, but within its context, it's fluent. Score here is likely 5, as there are no errors and the language is appropriate.

Now, checking for issues. For Coherence: Possible issue with lengthy paragraphs and some repetitive explanations, but they support the argument. For Fluency: Archaisms, but that's intentional and correct for the context. No major issues.

Finalizing scores. Coherence: 4 (strong structure, logical flow, minor density issue). Fluency: 5 (perfect grammar, appropriate style).

Issues: 
- Dense, lengthy paragraphs may impede readability for some readers.
- Repetitive emphasis on key distinctions (e.g., sign vs. thing signified), though largely intentional for argumentative clarity.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
