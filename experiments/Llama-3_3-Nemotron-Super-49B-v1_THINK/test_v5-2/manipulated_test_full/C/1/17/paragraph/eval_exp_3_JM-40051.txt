Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the criteria for each metric.

Starting with Fluency: This involves syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation, and smooth flow. The text is quite long and written in an archaic style, which might make it harder to read. I notice some archaic terms and sentence structures, like "veritable" and long, complex sentences. There are a few possible typos, such as "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring). The punctuation seems mostly correct but dense, which could affect readability. The author uses rhetorical questions and repetitive phrases ("Come and see!") which might disrupt fluency for modern readers.

Now, Coherence: This is about the logical structure, sequence of ideas, connections between sections, and overall narrative clarity. The story jumps between biblical references, geographical descriptions, personal anecdotes, and scientific justifications. There's a clear central claim (identifying a location as the Garden of Eden), but the supporting points are scattered. Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the text shifts abruptly from describing the garden's features to discussing cyclones, then to quotes from other works, and includes unrelated passages (like the bit about George Stransom or the commercial traveler). These disruptions make the narrative disjointed.

Looking at the structure, the author starts with a thesis, provides some biblical context, describes the location, addresses criticisms, and ends with testimonials. However, the inclusion of unrelated sections (e.g., the George Stransom passage, the motor car killing, or the dialogue snippets) breaks the coherence. These sections seem out of place and don't contribute to the main argument. The text also repeats the "Come and see" invitation multiple times, which, while persuasive, adds redundancy.

For Fluency, despite some errors and archaic language, the text is mostly grammatically correct. The main issue is the dense, overly complex writing style which hampers smooth reading. I'd rate Fluency a 3 because while there are minor errors, the biggest problem is the challenging readability due to style and length.

For Coherence, the main issues are the lack of clear transitions, irrelevant inserts, and a somewhat chaotic structure despite a central theme. The narrative isn't logically sequential, and the abrupt jumps between ideas reduce coherence. Thus, Coherence would be a 2, as the disorganization outweighs the occasional logical flow in some paragraphs.

Issues: 
- **Archaisms and overly complex sentence structures** hinder modern readability.
- **Minor typos** (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg").
- **Repetitive phrasing** ("Come and see!") and dense punctuation.
- **Abrupt, unconnected passages** (e.g., George Stransom, motor car anecdote) disrupt flow.
- **Lack of clear transitions** between ideas (e.g., biblical theory, scientific claims, random dialogue).
- **Redundant or irrelevant sections** (e.g., Lewisâ€™s dairying speech, fragmented quotes).

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
