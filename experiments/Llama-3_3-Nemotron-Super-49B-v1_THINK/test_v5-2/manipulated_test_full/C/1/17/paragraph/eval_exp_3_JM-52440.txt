Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale, and list the issues in bullet points.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text appears to be a theological treatise from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic beliefs, particularly on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The author analyzes Church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies to argue against the Real Presence doctrine.

Looking at Fluency: The text is formal, with complex sentences and theological vocabulary. Grammar and spelling seem correct. However, the structure is dense with long paragraphs and repetitive explanations. There are sudden inserts of unrelated passages (like the opium hag, Millet's painting, newspaper clippings) that disrupt the flow. These interruptions are jarring and unrelated to the main topic, causing fluency issues. The author's style is persuasive but could be clearer with better transitions and paragraph breaks.

For Coherence: The main argument is clearâ€”the Church of England does not teach Real Presence. The author uses logical steps, citing specific documents in order. However, the inclusion of unrelated excerpts (e.g., George Stransom's story, Millet's art) creates abrupt jumps. These sections don't contribute to the theological argument and disrupt the narrative's logical flow. The conclusion effectively summarizes the points, but the overall structure is weakened by these interruptions.

Issues to note for Fluency: 
- Sudden unrelated passages disrupt flow.
- Overly complex sentences may hinder smooth reading.
- Lack of clear paragraph breaks or transitions between ideas.

Issues for Coherence:
- Unrelated sections cause logical disruptions.
- Despite a clear main argument, the structure is marred by non sequiturs.

Scoring: 
Fluency: The technical aspects (grammar, syntax) are good, but the disruptions and complexity lower the score. Maybe 3.
Coherence: Main argument is logical, but the unrelated inserts badly disrupt coherence. Maybe 2 or 3? Since the main points are clear but structure is poor due to interruptions, perhaps 2.

Wait, but the unrelated texts are significant. They seem like copy-paste errors or mistakes in the text provided. If those are errors, the actual text without them would have better coherence and fluency. But assuming the text is as given, those parts are major issues.

So Fluency: 3 (due to complexity and errors in flow from inserts)
Coherence: 2 (main argument clear, but structure severely impacted by unrelated content)
</think>

Issues: 
- **Fluency**: Overly complex, dense paragraphs; abrupt, unrelated narrative inserts (e.g., opium hag, Millet, George Stransom) disrupt flow; archaic language may impede readability.
- **Coherence**: Logical argument undermined by non-sequitur passages (e.g., random literary/artistic descriptions) that fracture thematic continuity; poor transitions between theological analysis and tangential content.

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
