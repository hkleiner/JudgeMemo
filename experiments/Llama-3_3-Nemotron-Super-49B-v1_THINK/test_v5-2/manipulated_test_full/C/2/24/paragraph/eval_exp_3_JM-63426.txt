Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale of 1 to 5. The user provided a lengthy story about Will Bradley's life, split into chapters. 

First, I'll start by understanding the criteria. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Coherence is about how well the story unfolds as a whole, including logical sequence, non-repetition, smooth connections, avoiding ambiguities, etc.

Looking at the story, it's a biography written in a somewhat old-fashioned style, which might be intentional given the subject's time period. The chapters are chronological, which is good for coherence. Each chapter covers a different period in Bradley's life, which helps in structure.

For Fluency: The writing is generally clear, but there are some long, winding sentences. For example, in the "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" chapter, the dialogue with Richard Harding Davis is a bit lengthy and could be broken up. However, the grammar and spelling seem correct. The use of antiquated terms (e.g., "gasconade") might cause some readers to pause, but they're explained or contextual enough. The text mostly flows well despite some verbosity.

For Coherence: The narrative follows Bradley's life in a logical order. Each chapter transitions smoothly to the next, covering his growth from a young printer to a renowned designer. There's some repetition in mentioning his use of Caslon type, but it's thematic and intentional to show his preference. The story doesn't jump around and maintains a clear structure. The only minor issue might be the inclusion of the chronology and afterword, which feel a bit tacked on but are likely part of the original document's structure.

Potential deductions: Fluency might lose a point for overly complex sentences and some archaic language. Coherence stays high because the structure is strong, even if some sections (like the chronology) break the narrative flow slightly. But since the chronology is presented as part of the document, it's probably intended and doesn't disrupt the main story much.

So, Fluency: 4 (minor issues but overall good). Coherence: 5 (well-structured, logical flow).

Issues: 
- Occasionally verbose or complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- Inclusion of detailed chronology and afterword slightly disrupts narrative flow.
- Some archaic terminology (e.g., "gasconade") requires contextual understanding.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
