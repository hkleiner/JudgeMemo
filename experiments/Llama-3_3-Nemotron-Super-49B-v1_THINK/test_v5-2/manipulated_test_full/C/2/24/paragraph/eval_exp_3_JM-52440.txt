Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic beliefs. The author analyzes various church documents to argue against the Real Presence doctrine.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, using complex sentences and theological vocabulary. Grammar and spelling seem correct. However, the structure is quite dense with long paragraphs and no headings except chapter titles. The language is somewhat archaic (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing..."), which might affect readability. There are also sudden, unrelated phrases like "A keyboard clicked without being touched" which disrupt the flow. These interruptions are distracting and break the fluency. Despite the formal tone, the text is mostly clear, but the random tech inserts are a major issue. So Fluency score might be 3 or 4, but those random phrases hurt it.

For Coherence, the overall structure follows a logical argument: introduction, examining Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, Homilies, then chapters on Adoration and Sacrifice. Each part builds on the previous, targeting the three points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). However, the random phrases (keyboard, drone, etc.) are completely out of place and disrupt the narrative's coherence. Without those, the argument is well-structured and clear. But since those phrases are present, they cause abrupt jumps. So Coherence might be a 4 if ignoring the inserts, but with them, maybe 3.

Wait, the user instruction says to rate based on the given text as is. So those random phrases are part of the text and must be considered. They definitely cause coherence issues. So Coherence score would be lower, maybe 2 or 3. Fluency also suffers from them, so maybe 3.

But let me double-check. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, flow. The main text has good grammar but archaic style and dense paragraphs. The random tech phrases are errors or insertions that weren't supposed to be there? Or are they part of the story? The user provided the story with those lines, so I have to include them. They disrupt fluency and coherence. So Fluency: 3 (good grammar but poor flow due to inserts and density). Coherence: 2 (logical structure marred by unrelated phrases causing abrupt jumps).

Wait, the evaluation criteria for Coherence includes logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections. The main argument is logical, but the random phrases disrupt smoothness. So Coherence score: 2. Fluency: 3 because while the language is mostly fluent, the inserts and archaic style affect it.

Issues: 
- Archaisms and overly formal language may hinder readability.
- Random, unrelated phrases (e.g., "A keyboard clicked...") disrupt flow and coherence.
- Dense, lengthy paragraphs without clear section breaks impair readability.
- Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted.

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
