Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any coherence issues.

Starting with the introduction, the text discusses Dickens's later works and his shift towards more constructed plots, comparing him to Wilkie Collins. Then it transitions into discussing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," mentioning Dickens's health issues and how the story was left unfinished. The author analyzes characters and their relationships, then moves into the story's opening scenes.

Looking for coherence problems: The introduction seems to jump between discussing Dickens's writing style, his health, and then the specific novel. There's a mention of Lord Lytton's tale, which might be a bit abrupt. The transition from the introduction to the "Dramatis Personæ" section feels sudden without a clear connector. 

In the character descriptions, there's a lot of detailed backstory, which might be overwhelming. The opening of the tale starts abruptly with Jasper's opium vision. The text also mentions various critics and their theories (like Mr. Proctor and Mr. Walters) without clear integration into the main narrative. 

Possible issues: 
1. **STRUCTURE**: The introduction and the detailed character section might disrupt the flow. The shift from general discussion to specific character analysis isn't smoothly transitioned.
2. **TRANSITION**: Moving from the introduction to the Dramatis Personæ and then to the story opening could be smoother.
3. **CLARITY**: Some sentences are complex and packed with information, making them hard to follow. For example, the part about Princess Puffer's timeline and her possible relation to Jasper.
4. **LOGIC**: The connection between Dickens's interest in the supernatural and the plot isn't clearly explained. 

The text is generally understandable, but there are noticeable shifts and some confusing segments. It doesn't fall apart completely, so it's not a 1 or 2. The issues are more about transitions and clarity rather than total incoherence. Maybe a score of 3 because while it's mostly coherent, there are several points where the flow is disrupted.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from introductory analysis of Dickens’s style to detailed character backstories without clear connective tissue.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing literary critics/theories (e.g., Forster, Lytton) to the narrative of *Edwin Drood* without smoothing the flow.  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, complex sentences (e.g., explanations of Princess Puffer’s timeline and Jasper’s opium use) that slow comprehension.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear relevance of Dickens’s supernatural interests to the plot analysis.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
