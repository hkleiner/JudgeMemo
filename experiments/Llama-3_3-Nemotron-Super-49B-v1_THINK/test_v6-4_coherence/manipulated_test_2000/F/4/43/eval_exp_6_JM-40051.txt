Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify coherence issues. The text is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location along the Mississippi River. 

Starting with coherence, the main points are whether the ideas flow logically, transitions are smooth, and there's no repetition or abrupt jumps. The author starts by introducing their discovery cautiously, then delves into biblical references and geographical descriptions. There's a lot of detail about the location, comparing it to the biblical Eden with rivers and features. 

One thing I notice is the shift between the author's personal journey of discovery and the detailed geographical descriptions. For example, they mention standing on the "hanging garden" and then launch into a lengthy description of the area's features. The transitions here might feel abrupt because the narrative jumps from personal reflection to detailed, almost encyclopedic descriptions without clear connectors.

Also, there are some sentences that seem disjointed. The part where the text mentions "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,'" looks like a typo or a jumbled sentence. That's definitely a coherence issue because it's unclear and disrupts the flow. 

The author uses biblical quotes and then applies them to the Mississippi location, which is a logical connection in their argument, but the explanations might be too verbose. For instance, explaining the rivers and their names in relation to Eden could be clearer with smoother transitions. 

There's also repetition in emphasizing the beauty and uniqueness of the location. While repetition can be effective, here it might make the text feel a bit redundant. For example, multiple statements about the garden's perfection and the inability to describe its beauty fully could be condensed.

Looking at the structure, the text moves from introduction to biblical context, then to the discovery, followed by detailed geography. The structure is mostly logical, but some sections feel like info dumps without clear links between paragraphs. 

In terms of logic, the author's argument relies heavily on personal impression and biblical interpretation without external evidence, which might not be a coherence issue per se but affects the overall persuasiveness. However, coherence is more about the flow of ideas rather than the validity of the argument.

The most serious issues are the jumbled sentences (like the "Nineteen..." part), abrupt transitions between personal anecdotes and detailed descriptions, and some unclear transitions between paragraphs. These would affect the coherence score. 

Based on the criteria, a score of 3 seems appropriate because there are noticeable issues (like the jumbled text and some transitions) that affect the reading experience, but the overall structure is generally followable. The text isn't completely incoherent, but there are enough problems to prevent it from being mostly coherent (which would be a 4).

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between personal narrative and detailed geographical descriptions (e.g., shift from standing on the "hanging garden" to river measurements).
- [CLARITY] Jumbled, unreadable sentences (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river ‘below greed’").
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between paragraphs (e.g., biblical analysis to Mississippi location details).
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repetitive emphasis on beauty without concise summarization.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
