Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite lengthy and old-fashioned, so first I need to read through it carefully to identify coherence issues.

Starting with the structure: The text jumps between different ideas. The author starts talking about discovering the Garden of Eden, then goes into biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes. There's no clear flow; it feels like multiple topics are mashed together without smooth transitions.

Looking at coherence, there are abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from discussing the Bible's description of Eden to the author's personal discovery in the Midwest feels disconnected. The text also repeats ideas, like the comparison between the Mississippi and Euphrates rivers, which isn't necessary and disrupts the flow.

Clarity is another issue. Some sentences are overly complex or have grammatical errors ("it has  am opening", "which had caused explorers..."). These make understanding difficult. For instance, the part about the garden's location and the rivers' configuration is hard to visualize due to vague descriptions.

Logic problems exist too. The author assumes the Garden must be in a temperate zone without fully justifying it, and the connection between the described location and biblical Eden is weak. There's also a lack of clear evidence supporting the claim, just assertions.

Transitions between paragraphs are poor. The shift from geological features to the presence of rattlesnakes (the serpent) is abrupt and unexplained. The text meanders, making it hard to follow the main argument.

Despite some attempts at organization, the overall structure is disjointed. The author mixes personal anecdotes, biblical interpretation, and geographical details without a cohesive narrative thread. This makes the text challenging to follow, even though individual parts might be understandable.

Considering the evaluation scale, the text has noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and some confusing segments. These affect the reading experience but don't make it impossible to understand. So, a score of 3 seems appropriateâ€”generally coherent but with significant issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences (e.g., "it has am opening") and grammatical errors ("which had caused explorers...") hinder understanding.  
- [LOGIC] Unjustified assumptions (e.g., temperate zone requirement) and weak evidence linking the described site to Eden.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jumps (e.g., from rivers to rattlesnakes) disrupt flow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
