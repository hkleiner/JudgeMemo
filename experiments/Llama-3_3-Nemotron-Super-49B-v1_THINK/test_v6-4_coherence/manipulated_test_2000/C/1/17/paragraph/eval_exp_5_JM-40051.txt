Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text and provide a score from 1 to 5 with half-points. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any coherence issues.

Looking at the text, it starts with a title about the Garden of Eden and then jumps into a discussion about the author's discovery. The first part seems to connect the Garden of Eden with a location in America, specifically between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The author uses biblical references and describes the geography, which seems coherent in itself. However, after that, there are sudden shifts to completely unrelated narratives. 

For example, there's a paragraph about Jasper and Rosa, which appears to be a romance or drama scenario. Then, a description of a house with Mrs. Umney, which seems like a scene from a different story, possibly "The Canterville Ghost" given the names. Next, there's a part about a glass partition in an office, and then a mention of Christians in the hanging garden. Further on, there's a section about George Stransom reacting to Kate Creston, which is another unrelated character interaction.

These abrupt switches between topics are major coherence issues. The text jumps from a religious/geographical argument to unrelated fictional scenes without any transitions or connections. Each segment on its own might be coherent, but together they disrupt the overall flow. The lack of transitions and the mixing of different storylines make the text hard to follow. The author's main point about the Garden of Eden location is interrupted by unrelated narratives, causing confusion.

I need to categorize these issues. The main problems are [STRUCTURE] due to the disjointed sections, [TRANSITION] because there are no links between paragraphs, and possibly [LOGIC] if the connections between ideas are illogical. However, the logic within each individual section might be okay, but the overall structure is the big issue.

The evaluation scale says a score of 3 is for noticeable abrupt shifts affecting the reading experience. Since the text has multiple abrupt jumps and no clear structure connecting the parts, it's definitely below a 4. But it's not a complete mess; some parts are understandable on their own. So a 2.5 might be appropriate because there are frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas, making overall coherence difficult to follow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected narrative shifts between religious/geographical argument, unrelated fictional scenes (Jasper/Rosa, Mrs. Umney, office partition, George Stransom), and biblical descriptions without logical transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] Complete lack of bridging between disparate topics (e.g., Garden of Eden theory to "The Canterville Chase" excerpt).  
- [LOGIC] Illogical juxtaposition of biblical interpretation with unrelated character dialogues/scenes.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**
