Okay, let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify coherence issues. The text is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. 

First, I notice the structure. The text starts with a title and then jumps into the author's discovery process. There's a lot of biblical referencing and geographical descriptions. The flow seems a bit disjointed. For example, the author talks about their initial skepticism, then shifts to discussing the location's features without clear transitions. 

Looking at coherence criteria: logical sequencing, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities. The text has several abrupt shifts. For instance, after discussing the biblical description, it suddenly talks about the Mississippi River location without a smooth link. There's also repetition in describing the beauty of the location multiple times, which might be redundant.

Another issue is clarity. Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the part about the river's banks and the garden's layout has complex descriptions that could confuse the reader. 

Transitions between paragraphs could be better. The author moves from talking about the discovery to quoting Bible verses and then to specific locations (La Crosse, Winona) without clear connections. The text assumes the reader is familiar with certain biblical references or geographical terms without explanation.

There's also a logical jump when the author discusses the serpent in the garden, introducing rattlesnakes out of nowhere. It feels like a tangent. The conclusion about Christians destroying serpents also comes suddenly.

Despite these issues, the overall argument is somewhat understandable. The author's enthusiasm and detailed descriptions, while overly elaborate, do convey a unified claim. However, the frequent shifts and lack of clear transitions detract from coherence.

So, categorizing the issues: STRUCTURE for disjointed sections, CLARITY for complex sentences, TRANSITION for abrupt jumps between ideas, and LOGIC for the serpent tangent. The most serious problems are the structure and transitions, which affect the flow significantly. 

Scoring: Since there are noticeable issues but the text is still generally followable, maybe a 3. It's not a 2 because some parts connect, but it's below 4 due to the frequent disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between biblical context, personal discovery, and geographical details without clear connectors.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth progression between paragraphs (e.g., jump from serpent symbolism to modern settlement).  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex, repetitive descriptions (e.g., river banks, bluffs) that obscure key points.  
- [LOGIC] Tangential claims (e.g., rattlesnakes as "serpents") disrupting logical flow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
