Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long, so I need to go through it carefully. First, I'll read through the entire text to get a sense of its structure and content. Then, I'll look for coherence issues based on the criteria provided.

Starting with the structure: The text has multiple sections. It begins with an introduction about the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden's location. Then it delves into biblical references and geographical descriptions, followed by a detailed explanation of the location on the Mississippi River. There's a part where the author invites the reader to imagine the scene, describing the landscape and mentioning the presence of rattlesnakes, which ties back to the biblical serpent. The conclusion seems to summarize the beauty and significance of the location.

Now, checking for coherence problems. Coherence involves logical sequencing, smooth connections between ideas, clear transitions, and consistency. Let's break down potential issues:

1. **Structure and Transitions**: The text jumps between different topics. For example, after discussing the biblical context, it shifts to the author's personal experience of standing on the hanging garden without a clear transition. There's a lack of smooth connections between paragraphs. The author moves from geological descriptions to talking about snakes and then to the destruction of serpents by Christians, which feels abrupt.

2. **Repetition**: Some points are repeated, like the beauty of the location and its comparison to the Euphrates. While emphasis is okay, repetition without adding new insight might disrupt flow.

3. **Logic**: The argument relies heavily on assumptions (e.g., the Garden's location must be temperate, lacking mineral wealth) without clear logical links to the chosen site. The connection between the described geography and biblical Eden seems based on vague similarities rather than rigorous evidence.

4. **Clarity**: Some sentences are complex and hard to follow. For instance, the description of the river banks and the garden's layout might confuse readers due to lengthy, detailed paragraphs without clear summaries.

5. **Abrupt Jumps**: The text mentions "Out of Eden to water the garden" suddenly, which might be a quote or a transition but isn't clearly integrated. Also, the shift from geography to the story about Mr. Dovile killing snakes feels disconnected.

Considering the evaluation scale: 

- A score of 5 requires highly coherent, smooth connections. This text doesn't meet that due to the issues mentioned.
- A score of 4 allows for a few weak parts but overall coherence. The text has more than a few issues; the structure is somewhat disjointed, and transitions are poor.
- Score 3 is for noticeable abrupt shifts affecting the reading experience. This seems to fit because while the overall narrative is followable, there are several points where the flow is disrupted.

The most serious problems are the lack of clear transitions between ideas, repetitive emphasis without progression, and logical leaps in argumentation. These fall under [STRUCTURE], [TRANSITION], and [LOGIC] categories.

Final score: 3. The text is generally coherent but has significant coherence issues that impact the reading experience.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description without clear transitions.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between paragraphs (e.g., jump from serpent symbolism to urban development critique).
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., "not too far north/south") lack explicit logical linkage to the claimed location.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex, repetitive descriptions (e.g., riverbank geography) obscure key points.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
