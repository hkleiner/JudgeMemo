Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text using a specific format. First, I need to understand what coherence means here. The criteria mention logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections, clear progression, avoiding ambiguities, and consistent structure.

Looking at the text, it's a long, 19th-century style piece claiming to locate the Garden of Eden in the Midwest. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions. The first thing I notice is the meandering structure. The text jumps between different topics: the author's discovery, biblical interpretations, descriptions of the landscape, responses to critics, and even geological notes. There's no clear outline or transition between sections. For example, the author talks about the rivers, then suddenly quotes a dairyman's speech without a smooth link.

Repetition is another issue. The author repeats the claim that this location matches the Bible's description multiple times, and phrases like "Come and see!" are used repeatedly without adding new information. This makes the text feel redundant.

There are also abrupt shifts. For instance, moving from describing the garden's beauty to discussing cyclones and then to geological age without clear connections. The transitions between ideas are weak or missing. The text assumes a lot of prior knowledge, like the significance of certain locations or biblical references, which might confuse readers not familiar with them.

The structure is disorganized. Instead of building a logical argument step by step, the author presents various points in a haphazard way. There's a lack of clarity in how each section supports the main claim. Ambiguities arise from vague terms like "the garden" without consistent definition, and unclear how the described features uniquely fit the biblical Eden.

Despite these issues, the text isn't completely incoherent. There's a central thesis, even if poorly executed. Some parts, like the landscape descriptions, are vivid but don't contribute coherently to the argument. 

Rating-wise, the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas, making it hard to follow without effort. But it's not entirely incoherent since the main point is somewhat clear. So, a score of 2 seems appropriate. The most serious problems are poor structure, lack of transitions, repetition, and ambiguities.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with abrupt topic shifts (e.g., biblical interpretation, geography, dairy statistics, geology) lacking logical flow or clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Overreliance on assumed biblical and geographical knowledge without contextualization (e.g., "Palestine" comparisons, river names).  
- [TRANSITION] Repetitive appeals ("Come and see!") and unresolved tangents (e.g., cyclone explanations, mound-builder theories) disrupt coherence.  
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning (e.g., using beauty as "proof" of Edenâ€™s identity) and unconnected claims (e.g., dairy awards as relevance).  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **2**
