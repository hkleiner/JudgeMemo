Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria and output a specific format.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a biography of Will Bradley, structured with chapters like "AN INTRODUCTION," "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING," etc. The text is quite long, so I should break it down chapter by chapter to check for coherence issues.

Starting with the introduction: It seems to introduce Bradley's work and impact. The author mentions Bradley's contribution to making American public aware of avant-garde art. Then there's a jump to the 19th-century context with Morris, Beardsley, etc. The transition here might be a bit abrupt. The paragraph shifts from Bradley's personal introduction to a broader historical context without a clear connector. That could be a coherence issue under [STRUCTURE] or [TRANSITION].

Next, "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" chapter: This is a biographical account of Bradley's early life. It's written in a somewhat fragmented, episodic style with many specific details (e.g., earning five cents, buying a printing press, interactions with his father). The narrative jumps between different events in his childhood without smooth transitions. For example, moving from his father's illness to playing at the beach, then to his mother's dress-making, etc. These shifts might disrupt the flow, making it [CLARITY] or [STRUCTURE].

"FIRST SOJOURN IN CHICAGO" and subsequent chapters: These detail his career moves. There are specific anecdotes (like the egg nog incident, meeting Mr. Kasten) but the narrative sometimes feels like a list of events rather than a cohesive story. Transitions between paragraphs could be better. For example, moving from his struggles in Chicago to his marriage feels sudden. Also, technical terms like "Golding press" or "Miehle presses" are used without explanation, which might confuse readers not familiar with printing terminology, leading to [CLARITY].

Later chapters like "THE MAGAZINE WORLD" and "ENTER MR. HEARST" discuss his work with various publications. There's a lot of specific names (Collier, Hearst, etc.) and projects, but the connections between these sections aren't always clear. The text assumes knowledge of the period's publishing landscape, which could be an issue for some readers.

The "TODAY IN 1954" and "AN AFTERWORD" sections switch to a reflective tone and then a third-person summary. The shift from first-person narrative to third-person in the afterword might be jarring, affecting [STRUCTURE].

Now, categorizing the issues: 

1. Abrupt transitions between historical context and personal narrative in the introduction [TRANSITION].
2. Fragmented episodic structure in early life chapters [STRUCTURE].
3. Lack of explanations for technical terms [CLARITY].
4. Assumed background knowledge in later chapters [CLARITY].
5. Jarring shift from first to third person in afterword [STRUCTURE].

Most serious problems would be the structural jumps and lack of clarity from assumed knowledge or unexplained terms. However, the text is generally understandable, with minor lapses. The score should reflect that it's mostly coherent but with noticeable issues. Given the scale, a 3.5 seems appropriate because while there are several issues, the overall narrative is followable, and the main points are clear.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter transitions (e.g., historical context shifts, episodic biographical fragments)  
                 - [CLARITY] Unexplained technical/printing terms (e.g., "Golding press," "Miehle presses")  
                 - [TRANSITION] Jarring first-person to third-person narrative shift in "AN AFTERWORD"  
                 - [ASSUMPTION] Assumes reader familiarity with early 20th-century publishing/media context  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
