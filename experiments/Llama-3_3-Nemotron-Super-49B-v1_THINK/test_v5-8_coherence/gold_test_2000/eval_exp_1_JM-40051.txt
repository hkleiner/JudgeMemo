Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any coherence issues. 

The text is quite long, so I'll need to break it down. The author is arguing that a specific location between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota, is the Garden of Eden. The structure seems a bit meandering. Let me look for transitions between paragraphs and how ideas connect.

Starting with the beginning: The author mentions their discovery and publishing it. Then jumps into biblical context about God placing man. There's a shift from personal discovery to biblical interpretation. That might be a transition issue. 

In the next part, the author discusses the location on the Mississippi, comparing it to the Euphrates. There's a lot of descriptive language about the geography. The paragraphs about the hanging garden, the layout, and the rivers seem detailed but might lack clear connections to the main claim. For example, the mention of rattlesnakes feels abrupt—why is that relevant to Eden? It's supposed to symbolize the serpent, but the transition isn't smooth.

Also, the text mixes personal anecdotes (like Mr. Dovile killing snakes) with geographical descriptions and biblical references. These shifts might disrupt the flow. The author also switches between describing the beauty of the location and defending its validity as Eden without clear transitions. 

I need to check for logical flow. The argument relies on the author's impressions and some biblical interpretations, but there's no clear step-by-step reasoning. The conclusion about it being Eden seems based on personal conviction rather than a structured argument. 

Looking at the criteria: Score 3 is for noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions affecting the reading experience. Score 4 allows for a few weak parts but mostly coherent. This text has several abrupt shifts (snakes, personal stories, sudden biblical quotes), and while the overall structure is there, the transitions are poor. So maybe a 3.5? Wait, the issues are more than just a few. The lack of clear connections between paragraphs and the meandering descriptions might make it harder to follow. But the main idea is consistent throughout—the location is Eden. However, the supporting points aren't well-linked. 

I think the coherence is generally there but with significant disruptions. So a score of 3.5? Let me verify. The text has a clear overall structure (introduction, biblical context, location description, features matching Eden), but the execution has many abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. Each paragraph might make sense alone, but moving between them is jarring. So yes, 3.5 seems right. The issues are more than minor but don't make it incoherent overall.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between personal anecdotes (e.g., snake stories), biblical interpretations, and geographical descriptions without clear transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] Ideas (e.g., rattlesnakes as "serpents") are introduced without logical bridges to preceding or following content.  
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., valley layout) distract from the central argument and lack integration with biblical claims.  
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., Mississippi = Euphrates) are stated as fact without coherent justification or stepwise reasoning.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
