Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text and provide a score with issues listed.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's quite long, so I'll have to skim but focus on structure and flow. The text seems to be an old-style essay arguing that a specific location (near La Crosse, Wisconsin) is the Garden of Eden. The author uses biblical references, geographical descriptions, and comparisons to other places.

Looking for coherence issues: Coherence is about how well the text hangs together, logical progression, transitions, etc. 

I notice the text jumps between different topics: describing the location, refuting other theories, talking about geology, dairy farming, and biblical timelines. There's a lot of meandering. For example, the author discusses the beauty of the area, then suddenly talks about cyclones, then geology, then dairy products. These shifts might disrupt the flow.

Also, the structure isn't clear. There's no obvious introduction, body, conclusion. It feels more like a stream of consciousness. The author repeats "Come and see!" multiple times, which is motivational but disrupts coherence.

Check for transitions: The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs. One paragraph ends with a description of the view, the next starts talking about a German book without a clear link.

Logic and consistency: The author claims the area matches the Bible's Eden, but the reasoning is circular. They use the presence of rivers and beauty as proof, which isn't logically sound. Also, mixing scientific and religious arguments without clear integration.

Repetition: Some points are repeated, like the uniqueness of the location and challenges to skeptics. While emphasis is good, excessive repetition can harm coherence.

Now, categorizing the issues. Under coherence categories like STRUCTURE, TRANSITION, LOGIC, CLARITY.

STRUCTURE: The text lacks a clear outline, making it hard to follow. 

TRANSITION: Abrupt shifts between topics.

LOGIC: Assumptions without evidence, like assuming the location's beauty proves it's Eden.

CLARITY: Overly complex sentences and vague references (e.g., "the mound-builders" without explanation).

Other possible labels: REDUNDANCY for repetition, perhaps LEXICON if there are word choice issues, but the main problems are structural and logical.

Scoring: The text has some understandable parts, but overall it's hard to follow due to poor structure, lack of transitions, and logical leaps. It's not completely incoherent (some sections describe the landscape clearly), but significant issues. Probably a 2.5 or 3. Let's see the scale:

Score 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable issues affecting the reading experience. This text has more than noticeable issues; it's frequently hard to follow. Maybe 2.5? Because it has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas, but some parts are clear.

Yes, 2.5 seems right. The issues are frequent, and while the reader can grasp some points, the overall coherence is difficult.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Lacks clear organization; topics (geography, biblical interpretation, dairy farming, geology) are jarringly interleaved without logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between paragraphs (e.g., from cyclone discussions to dairy awards) with no connecting phrases.  
- [LOGIC] Assumes descriptive similarities (e.g., river names, beauty) constitute proof of being Eden, with circular reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Now, will any one believe us?") and vague references (e.g., "mound-builders" without explanation).  
- [REDUUNDANCY] Repetitive appeals ("Come and see!") and defensive asides (e.g., responses to hypothetical critics) disrupt focus.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
