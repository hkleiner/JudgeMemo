Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text and provide a score from 1 to 5 with half-points. The text is quite lengthy, so I need to read through it carefully to identify any coherence issues.

First, I'll start by skimming the text to get an overall sense. The text appears to be a 19th-century style essay arguing that a specific location (between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota) is the Garden of Eden. The author uses biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes.

Now, looking for coherence issues. Coherence is about how well the text holds together logically and flows smoothly. The categories to consider are LOGIC, STRUCTURE, CLARITY, TRANSITION, etc.

1. **STRUCTURE**: The text jumps between different topics. For example, it starts with the author's discovery, then dives into biblical interpretations, geographical details, comparisons with other locations (like Yosemite), discussions on climate and geology, references to other authors (Engel, Dr. Warren), and ends with promotional invitations to visit. The structure feels disjointed; there's no clear outline or progression from one idea to the next. It meanders a lot.

2. **TRANSITIONS**: There are abrupt shifts without smooth connections. For instance, moving from describing the beauty of the landscape to criticizing Dr. Warren's North Pole theory, then to discussing the mound-builders, and suddenly quoting a dairyman's speech. These transitions are missing, making the text choppy.

3. **CLARITY**: Some explanations are overly verbose or unclear. For example, the part about cyclones being prevented by the geography is confusingly explained. The author assumes the reader is familiar with certain terms or locations without explanation (e.g., "Havilah", specific bluffs and creeks).

4. **LOGIC**: There are logical leaps. The author claims their location fits the Bible description better than others but doesn't systematically compare or address counterarguments beyond dismissing others as unproven. The "proof" by hypothesis feels unconvincing without rigorous evidence.

5. **REPETITION**: Some points are repeated, like the uniqueness of the location and the invitation to "come and see," which disrupts the flow.

6. **LEXICON**: Archaic language (e.g., "antldiluvians", "Uphrates") might cause readability issues for modern readers, affecting clarity.

Despite these issues, the text isn't completely incoherent. The author has a central argument, even if poorly organized. The score should reflect that it's generally coherent but with noticeable problems. Based on the scale, a score of 3 seems right: "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience."

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with disjointed topics (e.g., biblical interpretation, geography, dairy farming, geology) lacking a clear logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., from criticizing Dr. Warren to discussing mound-builders) without connective phrases.  
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose explanations (e.g., cyclone prevention, geological age) and unexplained assumptions (e.g., "Havilah").  
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated leaps (e.g., equating local beauty with biblical Eden without systematic comparison).  
- [REPETITION] Repeated appeals ("Come and see!") and redundant descriptions.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic terminology ("antldiluvians," "Uphrates") hindering modern readability.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
