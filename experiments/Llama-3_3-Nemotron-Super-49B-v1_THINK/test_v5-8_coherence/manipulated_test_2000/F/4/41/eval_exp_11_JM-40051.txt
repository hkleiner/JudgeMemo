Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any issues with coherence. 

Looking at the text, it's quite lengthy and written in an older style, which might affect readability. The author is making a case for a specific location being the Garden of Eden. I need to check for logical flow, transitions, clarity, structure, etc.

Starting with the structure: The text has multiple sections. The beginning introduces the discovery, then there's a biblical context, followed by geographical descriptions, and comparisons with the Bible's Euphrates. The structure seems somewhat organized, but there are jumps. For example, the transition from discussing the author's initial impressions to the scientific placement of the first pair feels a bit abrupt. Also, the part about Trempealeau and the town site development seems like a tangent, disrupting the main argument about Eden's location.

Transitions between paragraphs could be better. The author moves from talking about the garden's features to mentioning snakes and then how Christians eradicated them. That shift isn't smoothly connected. Similarly, the description of the landscape is detailed but sometimes meanders, like the part about the lakes and the city of La Crosse, which, while relevant, isn't clearly linked to the preceding points.

Clarity is another issue. Some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence starting with "We need not now undertake to prove..." is complex and could be broken down. There are also assumptions, like the connection between the Mississippi and Euphrates being based on euphony of names, which isn't clearly explained.

Logic-wise, the argument relies heavily on the author's impressions and less on concrete evidence. The claim that the location matches biblical descriptions because of its beauty and central location might not be logically sound. The text assumes that being in a temperate zone and having certain geological features automatically make it Eden without addressing potential counterarguments or alternative locations.

Minor issues include typos (like "antldiluvians", "princopak", "cohsequently", "admirirg") and inconsistent naming (Euphrates vs. Mississippi, though that's part of the argument). These don't affect coherence much but contribute to overall quality.

Considering the scale, a score of 3 seems appropriate. The text is generally coherent with a clear main argument, but there are noticeable issues with transitions, some abrupt shifts, and lack of clear logical connections between ideas. The structure is mostly there but has disruptions. It's not mostly coherent (4) because the issues are more than minor, and not as bad as a 2 because the overall message is followable with effort.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shift from biblical context to geographical details, or from serpent description to Christian settlement).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between ideas (e.g., discussion of Trempealeau’s town site disrupts Eden argument).  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex, winding sentences (e.g., “We need not now undertake to prove…”).  
- [LOGIC] Assumptions (e.g., equating beauty or name similarity to biblical authenticity) without explicit evidence.  
- [RELEVANCE] Tangents (e.g., La Crosse’s lumber mills, snake eradication) loosely tied to central claim.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
