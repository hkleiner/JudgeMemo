Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any coherence issues. 

Starting with the introduction, the text seems structured, starting with a problem statement about confident assertions without proof. It transitions into the author's objective to examine the Church of England's documents. That part flows well. 

In Chapter I, the discussion shifts to the Real Presence. The author outlines two views: the Roman Catholic and the Reformation perspective. They then reference Scripture (John 6 and 1 Cor 10) and explain the connection between the Sacrament and feeding on Christ. The structure here is logical, contrasting different beliefs and stating the point of contention.

When discussing the Church of England's teachings, the author cites Articles, Catechism, etc. The 25th Article is quoted, defining sacraments as signs and witnesses of grace without substance change. The 27th Article on baptism supports this, showing consistency. The text argues that since baptism has no substance change, the Lord's Supper likely doesn't either, maintaining coherence with the Church's general definition.

Now, checking for coherence issues. The text is formal and detailed, with clear transitions between ideas. Each section builds on the previous, from problem statement to investigation methodology to examining specific Articles. The author contrasts views clearly and uses Scriptural references and Church documents logically. 

Potential issues might be in density and assuming background knowledge. The text is densely packed with theological concepts and references (e.g., specific Articles, sacramental theories) that might confuse readers unfamiliar with the topic. However, within its intended audience, this might be acceptable. There's also a long, complex sentence in the middle of Chapter I that could be a syntax issue, but it's still understandable. 

The structure is mostly clear, with each chapter focusing on a specific aspect. The author signals transitions like "Now it would be strange indeed..." to connect ideas. The only slight abruptness might be when moving from discussing Reformation principles to the Church's documents, but it's managed with transitional phrases.

So, the main coherence issues are the high density of specialized content and a few complex sentences, but overall the text is well-organized and logically connected. According to the scale, a score of 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly coherent with some minor weaknesses that don't disrupt flow significantly.

1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Dense, specialized theological content may overwhelm casual readers. - [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "thou," "whomsoever") and overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The material food..."). - [TRANSITION] Minor abruptness in shifting between Scriptural analysis and Church document examination.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
