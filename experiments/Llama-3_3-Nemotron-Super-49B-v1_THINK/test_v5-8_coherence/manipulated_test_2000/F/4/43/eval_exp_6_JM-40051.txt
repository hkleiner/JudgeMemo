Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any coherence issues. Coherence here refers to how well the text holds together logically, with smooth transitions and clear structure.

Looking at the text, it's a 19th-century style writing about the author's claim that a specific location in the American Midwest is the Garden of Eden. The text has several sections, starting with an introduction about the discovery, then biblical references, geographical descriptions, and comparisons to the Bible's Garden of Eden.

First, I notice that the text jumps between different ideas. For example, the author talks about the discovery, then shifts to biblical interpretations, then to geographical details without clear transitions. That might be a STRUCTURE issue because the organization isn't linear or logical. The sections don't flow smoothly from one to the next.

There are also abrupt shifts in topics. Like, after discussing the rivers and location, the author suddenly mentions rattlesnakes and then switches to the scenery. These transitions are unclear, which affects CLARITY. The reader might find it hard to follow why certain points are mentioned.

The text uses a lot of descriptive language, which is good for vividness, but sometimes the descriptions are overly elaborate and disrupt the main argument. For instance, the detailed explanation of the hanging garden's features might confuse the reader about the central claim. This could be a LEXICON issue if the vocabulary is too complex or distracting, but maybe more a STRUCTURE problem because it's not well-integrated.

There's repetition in emphasizing the location's beauty and its match with biblical descriptions. While some repetition is okay for emphasis, here it might make the text feel redundant. However, repetition for emphasis is common, so maybe that's not a major issue unless it disrupts coherence.

The author assumes the reader is familiar with certain biblical references and geographical locations without sufficient context. For example, comparing the Mississippi to the Euphrates might not be clear to all readers, leading to CLARITY issues.

Also, there are a few sentences that seem disjointed or hard to parse. For example, the part starting with "Nineteen been at lost a..." looks like a typo or a jumbled sentence, which is a SYNTAX or SPELLING issue. But since the user might have provided the text with errors, I should note that as a specific problem.

Now, categorizing these issues: The main problems are in STRUCTURE (lack of clear organization, abrupt topic shifts), CLARITY (assumptions without explanation, overly complex descriptions), and possibly some SYNTAX/SPELLING errors. 

For the score, the text is generally understandable, but there are several disruptions. The author's main points are there, but the execution is flawed. According to the scale, a 3 would mean "Generally coherent, but noticeable abrupt shifts..." which fits. However, if the issues are frequent enough to require extra effort, it might be a 2.5. But since the text doesn't completely fall apart and the core argument is somewhat followed, maybe 3 is appropriate.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., biblical analysis to rattlesnakes to scenery) without transitional links.  
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions disrupt focus on central claim.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear logical progression between paragraphs (e.g., biblical rivers to Midwestern geography).  
- [SPELLING/SYNTAX] Errors (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost aâ€¦") and convoluted sentences.  
- [ASSUMPTION] Unexplained biblical and geographical references assume reader familiarity.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
