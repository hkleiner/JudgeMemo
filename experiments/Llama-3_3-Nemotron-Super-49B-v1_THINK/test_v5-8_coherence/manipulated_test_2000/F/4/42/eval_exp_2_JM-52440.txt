Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to coherence. The evaluation has to be on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points allowed.

Looking at the text, it's a religious treatise from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Real Presence. The structure seems formal and organized, with chapters and clear topic transitions. The author starts with an introduction outlining the problem of unchecked assertions about the Church's doctrine, then moves to investigating the Real Presence by examining Church documents like Articles and the Catechism.

Now, checking for coherence issues. Coherence is about how well the text holds together logically and flows smoothly. The main points are clearly introduced: the problem, the method (examining documents), and the analysis of specific Articles. The author contrasts the Church of England's views with Rome's and the Reformation principles. 

Potential issues: There are some grammatical errors like "was" instead of "were" in a few places, but those are syntax issues, not coherence. However, the text is quite dense and assumes a lot of prior knowledge about theological terms and Church documents. For a general reader, this might make it hard to follow, affecting clarity. Also, the transition between discussing Scripture in Chapter I and moving to the Articles might feel a bit abrupt without a clearer connector, but the structure is logical. The author sets up the investigation plan and follows it, so the overall flow is there. 

The text stays focused on the central question of whether the Church teaches the Real Presence. Each section builds on the previous, and the use of headings helps. The only coherence issue might be the complexity and the expectation of background knowledge, which could confuse some readers, but according to the criteria, coherence is about logical connection and structure rather than accessibility. Since the text is well-organized and each part connects logically, even with some complexity, the coherence is generally good. 

So, the main coherence issues would be minor, like some transitions could be smoother, but overall it's well-structured. The score would likely be a 4, as it's mostly coherent with a few minor weak points but no significant disruptions.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Clear chapter divisions and logical progression, but dense theological terminology and assumptions of prior knowledge may hinder readability for non-experts.  
- [TRANSITION] Minor abruptness between Scriptural analysis and document examination (e.g., shift from 1 Cor. x. 16 to Articles without explicit bridge).  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "the practical conclusion is the same") and repetitive phrasing ("it would appear that the point at issue is...").  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
