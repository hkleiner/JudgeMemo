Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully, but since it's quite long, I'll focus on key aspects for fluency and coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. There are complex sentences with multiple clauses, like in Chapter 1: "He who stepped through the battered door in St. Andrew Street travelled fifteen hundred miles in a second." That's a bit convoluted. Also, vocabulary is rich but sometimes obscure, like "exhilarated" or "sycophancy" which might slow the reader. Checking for grammar and spelling: I didn't spot any obvious errors, so maybe a high score here, but the phrasing and word choice could be issues.

For Coherence, the structure is mostly chronological, with each chapter focusing on a different aspect of the Gypsies. However, transitions between chapters might be abrupt. For example, Chapter 3 jumps from describing the camp to discussing commercial traveling without a clear link. Also, some sections, like the Romani language explanation in Chapter 10, feel like tangents. The narrative sometimes meanders, like the detailed description of the photograph in Chapter 6, which, while engaging, disrupts the flow. The themes are generally well-connected, but some parts feel disconnected.

Now, assigning scores. Fluency: Despite some awkward phrasing and complex sentences, the text is mostly clear. Maybe a 4, as it's well-structured but has minor issues. Coherence: The overall structure is good, but there are abrupt shifts and some tangents. Maybe a 4 as well, since the main narrative holds but has weaknesses.

Wait, but in Chapter 10, the inclusion of the Romani story might be seen as a coherence issue. Also, the transition from Chapter 9 to 10 is sudden. That could lower coherence to a 3.5. Fluency remains at 4 because the language, while formal, is mostly fluent except for a few spots.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent, minor phrasing issues), Coherence 3.5 (some disjointed parts and tangents).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Chapter 1 opening) - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "sycophancy," "exhilarated") may hinder readability  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., Chapter 3 to 4) - [CLARITY] Tangential sections (e.g., Romani language explanation in Chapter 10) disrupt narrative flow  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
