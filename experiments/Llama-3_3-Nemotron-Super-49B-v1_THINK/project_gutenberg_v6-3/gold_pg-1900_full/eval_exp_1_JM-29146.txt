Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as given.

Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The scale goes from 5 (highly fluent) to 1 (incomprehensible).

Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logic, structure, transitions, and consistency. Similarly scaled.

The text provided is a sci-fi story. Let me read through it and note issues.

Starting with Fluency:

1. **Grammar and Syntax**: Are there any errors? The text seems mostly correct, but there are some long sentences that might hinder flow. For example, the dialogue can be lengthy without clear breaks. Also, some sentences are a bit convoluted, like the explanation of hyper-space mechanics. 

2. **Word Choice and Phrasing**: Are there awkward phrases? The term "splay-tongued reptile-humanoids" is creative but might be distracting. Some descriptions, like the detailed outfits, might slow the reader. 

3. **Punctuation**: Any issues? Mostly okay, but dialogue tags could be more varied to avoid repetition of "said".

Now Coherence:

1. **Logic and Structure**: The plot has a clear start (conflict on Irwadi) and builds towards the hyper-space world. However, the introduction of Vardin as proto-man feels sudden. The transition from space action to the mystical elements might be abrupt for some readers.

2. **Transitions**: Chapter breaks aren't marked, so the shifts in scene (e.g., from the gambling hall to the apartment) could be smoother. 

3. **Character Motivations**: Margot's drive is clear, but her switch from determined to loving at the end feels rushed. Garr Symm's transformation isn't fully explained, relying on the proto-man's power without clear setup.

Now, categorizing the issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentences impair clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices (e.g., "splay-tongued") might be distracting.
- [PUNCTUATION] Repetitive dialogue tags.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Sudden reveal of Vardin's true nature without prior hints.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene transitions without clear breaks.
- [CHARACTER] Margot's character shift from ambitious to loving feels unearned.

Scoring:

Fluency: Mostly fluent but with minor issues. Maybe a 4? The issues don't disrupt readability much.

Coherence: Noticeable structure and logic issues, but the story mostly holds. Around 3.5?

Wait, the Vardin reveal is a big coherence issue. Maybe Coherence is 3?

But the story has a logical flow overall, even if some parts are weak. Maybe 3.5 for Coherence.

Finalizing:

Fluency: 4 (mostly fluent, minor syntax and word choice issues)
Coherence: 3.5 (some structural and logical lapses, but generally coherent)
</think>

Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures. - [LEXICON] Distracting or overly elaborate word choices (e.g., "splay-tongued"). - [PUNCTUATION] Repetitive dialogue tags ("said") without variation.
2. Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Abrupt, unforeshadowed reveal of Vardin’s true identity. - [STRUCTURE] Unclear scene transitions (e.g., apartment to Graveyard) without narrative breaks. - [CHARACTER] Margot’s rapid shift from ambition to romantic submission feels unearned.
3. FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
