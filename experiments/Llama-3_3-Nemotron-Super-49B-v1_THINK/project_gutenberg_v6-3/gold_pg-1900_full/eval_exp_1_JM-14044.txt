Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text provided is quite long, so I need to focus on the key aspects of fluency and coherence as per the criteria.

First, Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might make it a bit challenging for modern readers, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue unless it causes confusion. Scanning through, I notice complex sentences, but they seem structured correctly. There are no obvious grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary is rich, with terms like "tepidarium" or "guttural scream," but they're used appropriately. The only possible issue might be the density of the prose, which could make it less fluent for some readers, but given the era it's written in, it's acceptable. So Fluency score is likely high, maybe 4.5 or 5.

Next, Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas connect, logical flow, structure, etc. The text has multiple chapters and topics. The introduction sets up the story of "The Bowmen" and its impact, then each chapter explores different aspects or related stories. The author jumps between explaining the origins of the story, its reception, and then presenting the story itself followed by other tales. The transitions between chapters might feel a bit disjointed since each chapter is somewhat standalone, but within each, the narrative is clear. There's a thematic connection throughout about wartime legends and the supernatural. However, the shift from the author's introduction to the fictional stories might cause some abruptness. Also, the Postscript adds another layer with Miss Campbell's article, which critiques the evidence for the Angels of Mons, maintaining coherence by tying back to the legend's scrutiny. Overall, the coherence is good but not perfect due to the episodic structure. Coherence score might be around 4.

Wait, let me check again. The author's introduction discusses the controversy around "The Bowmen," then Chapter 1 tells the story, followed by other related tales. The structure is a collection of related pieces, so while each part connects to the theme, the overall flow might have minor weaknesses in transitions between very different narrative styles (e.g., from essayistic introduction to fictional chapters). But the author does link them through the central legend. So maybe Coherence is still a 4, as the parts are mostly connected but could have smoother transitions.

Finalizing: Fluency is 5 because there are no errors, just complex style. Coherence is 4 due to some disjointedness between chapters but overall thematic unity.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary and complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for modern readers.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Chapters transition somewhat abruptly between essayistic reflection, fictional narratives, and critique (e.g., Postscript), though thematic unity is maintained.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 5
