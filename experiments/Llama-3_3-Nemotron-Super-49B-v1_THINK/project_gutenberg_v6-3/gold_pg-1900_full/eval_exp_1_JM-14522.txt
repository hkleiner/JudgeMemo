Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as defined. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which I recognize as a classic. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Since it's a well-known work, I expect high fluency. But I need to check for any issues. Scanning through, the language is formal, Victorian-era English. There might be some complex sentences, but that's typical for the period. I don't see any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or awkward phrasing that would disrupt flow. The vocabulary is rich but appropriate. So Fluency score is likely high, maybe 5.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, transitions, no ambiguities. The story has chapters, each with a clear progression. The narrative moves from the Otis family moving in, encountering the ghost, their interactions, and the resolution with Virginia. The structure is logical, each event leads to the next. Transitions between chapters seem smooth. However, there might be some abrupt shifts in tone, like from humor to melancholy, but that's intentional in Wilde's style. The only possible issue is the sudden disappearance of Virginia and the reveal, but it's explained later. So Coherence is also high, maybe 5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any parts where the story jumps without connection? The transition from the ghost's attempts to scare them to Virginia's final interaction might feel a bit sudden, but it's set up with her character development. The prophecy in the library window ties into the ending. So overall, coherence holds. 

Therefore, both scores should be 5. But I need to ensure there are no minor issues. For Fluency, maybe some sentences are long, but they're well-constructed. For Coherence, all elements tie together without confusion. So final scores: Fluency 5, Coherence 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [None]  
2) Coherence Issues: - [None]  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*The text exhibits flawless fluency, with sophisticated, era-appropriate language, impeccable grammar, and smooth syntax. Coherence is equally strong, with a logically structured narrative, seamless transitions, and a unified thematic progression. No deductions are warranted for either metric.*
