Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify issues with fluency and coherence. The text is quite long, so I'll need to break it down chapter by chapter or by sections.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might be intentional given the subject matter (Will Bradley's life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries). However, archaic language isn't necessarily a fluency issue unless it causes confusion. I'll look for actual errors or awkward phrasing.

Looking through the chapters, there are long sentences, especially in the "GAY NINETIES" and "SPRINGFIELD: THE WAYSIDE PRESS" chapters. For example, the description of Chicago in the 1890s has very detailed, lengthy sentences that might disrupt flow. Also, some sentences are fragmented or use colloquial expressions like "God love them and the editorial lads..." which might be a bit jarring but are stylistic choices.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect and the overall structure. The text is autobiographical, moving through Bradley's life chronologically, which is generally clear. However, there are abrupt shifts between chapters. For example, moving from his early life to his work in Chicago without clear transitions. Also, some sections, like the "MAGAZINE WORLD" chapters, might feel like tangents or lack smooth connections to the preceding narrative.

In the "SPRINGFIELD" chapter, there's a detailed discussion about typography and the Wayside Press, which is relevant but might feel like a detour for some readers. The text also includes a chronology and afterword, which are helpful but separate from the narrative flow.

For fluency scores, despite some long sentences and archaic terms, the text is mostly readable. The errors I found were minor, like "laying the type" (should be "laying out" perhaps, but it's a common mistake in the context). So fluency might score around 4, considering it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

For coherence, the structure is generally chronological but has some disjointed sections and lack of clear transitions between chapters. The inclusion of various elements like the chronology and afterword adds to the coherence issues if not integrated well. So coherence might score around 3.5, as it's generally coherent but with noticeable disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., descriptive passages in "GAY NINETIES").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and colloquialisms (e.g., "Vandyke," "fifth-class-wide black cravat").  
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor errors (e.g., "laying the type" instead of "laying out").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., "SPRINGFIELD" to "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK").  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connective phrases between thematic shifts (e.g., typography discussions vs. biographical narrative).  
- [LOGIC] Tangential sections (e.g., detailed typography history in "SPRINGFIELD") disrupting flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
