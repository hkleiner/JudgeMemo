Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly readable, but there are some grammatical errors. For example, "the effort was well spend" should be "well spent." Also, "would had been nought" is incorrect; it should be "would have been naught." There are a few subject-verb agreements, like "the persons listed... represented the true basis" â€“ maybe "person" is singular, but "persons" is plural, so that's a bit confusing. Then, in the chapter on Early Man, "About all we can said" should be "say." Also, "whether caves were used as shelter we do not know" has a missing article maybe, like "whether caves were used as a shelter." 

For coherence, the structure is generally logical, moving from acknowledgments to the Indian groups. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For instance, after discussing the Basketmakers, it jumps to the Apaches without a clear link. Also, in the Early Man chapter, the transition from talking about the projectile point to discussing what Early Man looked like feels a bit disconnected. The text mentions various groups but sometimes doesn't clearly explain how they connect to Carlsbad Caverns. For example, the part about the Guadalupe Mountains' geology is informative but could be better integrated into the narrative about the Indians.

So for fluency, the main issues are grammar and spelling mistakes, some awkward phrasing. For coherence, the transitions between sections could be smoother, and some parts feel a bit disjointed. The scores would reflect that fluency has noticeable errors but is mostly readable (maybe a 3.5), and coherence has some weaknesses but overall holds together (maybe a 4).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "would had been nought")  
- [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "well spend" instead of "well spent")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "About all we can said")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between group descriptions (e.g., Basketmakers to Apaches)  
- [CLARITY] Overly technical terms without context (e.g., "dolichocephalic")  
- [STRUCTURE] Geographical descriptions disconnected from narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
