Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given Civil War text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided scales.

First, Fluency. The text is a personal account, so the language is straightforward. I notice some minor grammatical issues, like "I have never have a very favorable opinion" which should be "I have never had..." That's a grammar mistake. Also, "took our side arms with us" should be "sidearms." There's "took the precaution to took" which is a repetition error. Punctuation seems mostly okay, but maybe some long sentences could affect flow. However, overall, it's readable with just minor issues. So Fluency score might be 4, since it's mostly fluent but has a few noticeable errors.

For Coherence, the narrative is chronological and each event follows logically. The author connects his experiences well, like the dance incident and the battle descriptions. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like jumping from the dance story to marching to Franklin without a clear link. Also, the part about Dr. Githens' spur and the sore foot feels a bit tacked on. The structure is generally clear, but some sections could have smoother transitions. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, mostly coherent with a few weak connections.
