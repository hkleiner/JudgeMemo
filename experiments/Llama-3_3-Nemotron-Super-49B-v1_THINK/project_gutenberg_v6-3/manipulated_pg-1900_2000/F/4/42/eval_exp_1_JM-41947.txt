Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. It's a biographical passage about François Boucher, starting from his birth and early life up to his artistic development.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. I notice long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the first paragraph has a very long sentence that stretches on, making it a bit hard to follow. There are also some outdated terms like "tipstaff," "maître-peintre," and "double-florins" which might require explanation, but since the text doesn't provide it, that could be a lexicon issue. However, the grammar and spelling seem correct. The phrasing is mostly formal and consistent, but the sentence structure varies, with some being overly long and others shorter. I might deduct a point for the overly complex sentences affecting fluency, but overall, it's well-structured with minimal errors. So Fluency might be a 4.

Now for Coherence. The narrative moves chronologically from Boucher's birth through his early training, competitions, and influences. Each chapter ("The Small Beginnings," "The Student") has a clear theme. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like jumping from Boucher's study with Lemoyne to the birth of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson without clear connections. Also, some historical events (like military defeats) are mentioned but not fully integrated into Boucher's story, feeling a bit like info dumps. The structure is generally logical, but there are minor disconnects. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since the main flow is clear but with a few weak links.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., first paragraph) disrupting smooth flow.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("tipstaff," "double-florins") without contextual clarification.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., Jeanne Antoinette Poisson’s introduction).  
- [CLARITY] Historical events (e.g., wars, royal succession) feel tangential to Boucher’s narrative arc.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
