Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency: The text is quite formal and uses complex vocabulary. I notice some long sentences, like the one describing the Prussian expedition. The structure is mostly clear, but the sentence length might affect readability. Are there any grammar errors? The example given uses "enough coulded be seen" which seems incorrect—should be "could be seen." Also, "in spite of these exceptions, it is at once recognised" might be a slight awkwardness with "at once recognised." Spelling? Not obvious, but "chequered" is correct in British English. Maybe some archaic terms like "fellahìn" but that's acceptable in historical context. So Fluency issues are minor grammar slips and long sentences, but overall fluent.

For Coherence: The text is structured with chapters, which helps. Ideas flow logically from discovery of tablets to their content and historical context. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like jumping from tablet descriptions to the Egyptian court without a clear link. Also, in Chapter II, the shift from Tell el Amarna to the XVIIIth Dynasty feels a bit disconnected. Some paragraphs are dense with names and events, which might confuse without prior knowledge. The overall narrative is logical, but minor disjointedness exists.

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent with minor issues, so 4.5? Wait, the "coulded" error is a clear grammar mistake. That's a deduction. Maybe 4 then.

Coherence: Mostly coherent but some weak transitions and density. Score 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("coulded") in sentence structure; - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence lengths affecting readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II without clear thematic bridge; - [CLARITY] Dense historical names/events requiring prior knowledge to fully follow.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
