Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some grammar errors. For example, "a young man twenty-two years of age come to Canada" should be "came". Also, "Boone remain" should be "remained". There's "they woulded have to be launched" which is incorrect; it should be "would have". These are grammatical errors. Additionally, some sentences are a bit long and could be broken up for better flow, but overall the structure is okay. Spelling seems fine, so no issues there. So fluency score might be around 4 because the errors are noticeable but don't disrupt reading too much.

Now coherence. The text is structured with chapters, which helps. Each chapter transitions logically. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like moving from LaSalle's expedition to the Virginians without a clear link. Also, in the third chapter, mentioning Simon Kenton's love affair feels a bit out of place without more context. The story generally follows a timeline, but some parts could have smoother transitions. The ideas are mostly connected, but a few sections feel disconnected. So coherence score might be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "come" instead of "came", "woulded" instead of "would have") - [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical figures/events (e.g., LaSalle to Virginians, Simon Kentonâ€™s introduction) - [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness in anecdotal details (e.g., love affair motivation)  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
