Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is about early woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts. The writing seems formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability. I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing. The sentences are long and complex, which could make them a bit hard to follow, but they're structured correctly. I noticed some archaic terms like "mediæval" and "rude cuts," but they're probably intentional given the topic. No obvious spelling mistakes. The main issue might be the density of information and long sentences, but overall, it's well-structured. Maybe a minor deduction for phrasing that's a bit outdated but not incorrect.

Now Coherence. The text has a clear structure, starting with an introduction, then discussing specific books and printers, and concluding with an evaluation of their artistic merit. The transitions between paragraphs seem logical, connecting different aspects of the woodcut books. However, there are a lot of specific examples and names listed, which might make the text feel a bit disjointed if the reader isn't familiar with them. The author jumps between different printers and their works, but each section connects back to the main point about the quality of the woodcuts. There's a clear progression from historical context to specific examples and then to artistic analysis. The only potential issue is the density of examples without clear headings, but the logical flow is maintained. So coherence is strong, but maybe a slight deduction for the lack of transitional phrases between some paragraphs or the sheer volume of specific references.

Final scores: Fluency is high, maybe 4.5 because while it's mostly fluent, the long sentences and archaic language might cause minor disruptions. Coherence is also high, around 4, since the structure is logical but the detailed examples might slightly disrupt smooth reading for some readers.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex, lengthy sentences may hinder immediate clarity.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "mediæval," "rude cuts") and formal tone may reduce readability for modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Dense listing of specific books/printers without explicit transitional phrases.  
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical art context/practitioners.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
