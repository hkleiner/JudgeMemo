Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues in both fluency and coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some noticeable errors. For example, "Ith" instead of "Is" in the first line—clear typo. Also, "find in the soil" should be "found". Then, "ecsthactly" is probably supposed to be "Exactly", and "thurrender" instead of "surrender". These are spelling mistakes due to the lisp, which is intentional for the Irwadian characters, but maybe overdone? Wait, the problem is if it affects readability. The lisp is consistent but might make some parts harder to read, especially with repeated "th" replacements. However, the story explains the lisp, so it's a stylistic choice. But maybe the frequency causes some fluency issues. Also, "dumb" instead of "down" in "hitting the sack"? Not sure. Wait, "hitting the sack" is correct, so maybe that's okay. Another spot: "You have no ship." followed by "No? Then what's this?" feels a bit abrupt, but that's dialogue, so maybe acceptable. 

For Coherence, the story flows logically. Each scene transitions well. However, there's a part where the narrative jumps from Ramsey leaving the Englanders to the gambling scene without clear transition. It says "As usual on Irwadi... bitterly cold. Sucker, Ramsey told himself. But he grinned..." Then suddenly he's at the gambling table. The transition could be smoother. Also, the introduction of the Earthgirl who can read minds feels a bit abrupt and unexplained. It's mentioned she can read minds because her parents were exposed to cosmic radiation, but this comes out of nowhere and isn't integrated well into the rest of the narrative. It disrupts the coherence because it's a random element not connected to the main plot points. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are the intentional lisp (which might be considered a stylistic choice but could deduct points if it's too distracting) and a couple of typos like "find" instead of "found". But since the lisp is consistent and part of the character's speech, maybe it's not a major flaw unless it hinders understanding. The actual errors like "find" are minor but present.

For Coherence, the abrupt introduction of the mind-reading Earthgirl and the scene transition to the gambling hall are the main issues. The rest of the story connects well, with each part leading to the next logically. The planetarization explanation is clear, and character interactions make sense.

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent, minor issues. Maybe a 4? Because the lisp, while intentional, might cause some minor disruption, but the text is generally smooth. The typos are few.

Coherence: Mostly coherent, but some transitions and introductions are abrupt. So maybe a 4 as well, since the main structure is logical but has a couple of weak points.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Intentional lisp ("ith", "thurrender") may slightly impede readability despite contextual justification.  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "find" instead of "found").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from Ramsey leaving the Englanders to the gambling scene without clear bridging.  
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained introduction of the Earthgirl’s telepathic ability disrupts narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
