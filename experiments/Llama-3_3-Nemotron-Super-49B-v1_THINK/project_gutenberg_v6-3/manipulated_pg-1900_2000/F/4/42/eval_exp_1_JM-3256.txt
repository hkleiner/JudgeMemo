Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and analyze it based on the Fluency and Coherence criteria provided.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from "BOOKS AND BOOKMEN," which seems like an older, possibly early 20th-century piece. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. Checking for grammar, syntax, spelling, and lexicon issues. 

I notice a few potential errors. For example, "which mighted be" should be "which might be" (subject-verb agreement). Also, "He woulded like to have" should be "He would like to have" (verb conjugation mistake). There's "the subject of the book does not entered" which should be "does not enter." These are grammatical errors. 

The sentence structure is mostly complex and well-constructed, but some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might affect fluency. However, given the period, this might be intentional. Spelling seems okay, but there are some outdated terms or phrases that might cause slight pauses for modern readers, but that's more about lexicon choice than errors. 

For Coherence, the text has a clear theme about distinguishing bookmen from mere book collectors. The anecdotes (like the library visit and the colonial squatter) support the main points. Transitions between ideas are generally smooth, though the essay meanders a bit, discussing various authors and examples. There's a logical flow from defining a bookman, contrasting with collectors, using examples, and concluding with the critic's role. However, some parts feel a bit disjointed, like the shift from the squatter story to discussing specific authors, but overall, it holds together. 

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the grammatical errors, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't severely disrupt reading. So maybe a 4? But the errors are noticeable, so perhaps 3.5? Wait, the scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues," and 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues." There are a few errors, but the text is still clear. So Fluency might be 4.

For Coherence, the structure is logical, ideas connect, but there are some abrupt transitions or lengthy examples that might slightly disrupt flow. So Coherence could be 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "mighted be" (incorrect verb form); "woulded like" (verb conjugation error); "does not entered" (tense inconsistency).  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "As he was to preside...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Mild meandering between anecdotes (e.g., squatter story to *Mark Rutherford* discussion).  
- [TRANSITION] Slight disjointedness in shifting between literary critiques and defining "bookman."  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
