Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text based on Fluency and Coherence using the given criteria. First, I need to go through the text carefully and note any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal and well-structured. The sentences are mostly clear and grammatically correct. However, there are a few places with awkward phrasing. For example, "which this same declaration foresaw with awesome clarity" might be a bit wordy. Also, in the "BIRTH OF A NEW REVELATION" chapter, "humanity’s response to this impulse has driven a succession of ideological upheavals that have convulsed our world and that appeared now to have exhausted themselves" has a slight awkwardness in "appeared now to have exhausted themselves." Maybe "now appear to have exhausted themselves" would be smoother.

Checking for grammar errors: In "the human race was call by God to embrace these changes," it should be "called." Also, "the event that lie at the heart of these developments" should be "lay." There's a typo in "which had am created" – should be "was created." Another error: "God hathed revived" instead of "hath revived." These are minor but noticeable.

Now, Coherence. The text is well-organized with clear chapters. The flow from one section to another is logical, connecting Bahá’u’lláh's life events and teachings. However, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, moving from the historical context to Bahá’u’lláh's personal experiences might benefit from clearer connectors. Also, the inclusion of quotes from Bahá’u’lláh adds depth but might disrupt the flow slightly if not properly integrated.

For Fluency score: Mostly fluent with some minor issues. Maybe a 4.5 because the errors are few and don't disrupt much.

For Coherence: Generally coherent with a clear structure, but minor transitions issues. Score 4.5 as well, since the overall logic is strong but not perfect.
