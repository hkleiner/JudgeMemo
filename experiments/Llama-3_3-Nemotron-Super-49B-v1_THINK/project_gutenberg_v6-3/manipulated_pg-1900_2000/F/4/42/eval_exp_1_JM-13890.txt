Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some points to note. In the first chapter, the sentence "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons is sent forth..." uses the present tense "is sent" which should be past tense "was sent" for consistency. That's a grammar error [GRAMMAR]. Then, in the line "many of the twentieth-century pilgrims are not possessed of the true spirit...", "do not disguised" should be "do not disguise" – another grammar mistake [GRAMMAR]. Also, "they was" instead of "they were" in the comparison with Chaucer's characters [GRAMMAR]. There's a possible lexical choice issue with "iron road" which might be better as "railway" for clarity [LEXICON]. 

For Coherence, the transition between Chapter I and II seems a bit abrupt. Chapter I talks about pilgrimages and the shrine's destruction, while Chapter II dives into Canterbury's history without a clear link. That's a STRUCTURE issue. Also, in Chapter II, the paragraph about the Roman occupation and then jumping to Augustine's arrival might feel a bit disconnected without smoother transitions [TRANSITION]. The text assumes some prior knowledge about historical figures and events, which could affect clarity for some readers [CLARITY].

Scoring Fluency: Despite the errors, the text is mostly readable. The grammar issues are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much. So maybe a 4? But there are a few errors, so perhaps 3.5?

Coherence: The structure is generally logical, but there are some abrupt shifts and assumptions. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly coherent but has some weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in "a writ of summons is sent" (should be "was sent").  
- [GRAMMAR] "do not disguised" (should be "do not disguise").  
- [GRAMMAR] "they was" (should be "they were").  
- [LEXICON] "Iron road" (could clarify as "railway" for modern readers).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I (pilgrimage culture) to Chapter II (historical backstory) without bridging context.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Roman occupation details to Augustine’s arrival without smoothing the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with historical figures/events (e.g., Bede, Luidhard) without brief contextualization.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
