Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and assess both Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is generally well-written, but I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" should probably be "sat quietly." There's also "as she with her small store of English words" which might be a bit awkward. In another part, "Wong Lui had placed his best before them" could be clearer. Also, "have shown respect" should be "had shown respect" (subject-verb agreement). Some sentence structures are a bit long and complex, which might affect readability, but overall, the text is mostly fluent with minor issues. So Fluency score might be a 4.

Now Coherence. The story seems to flow logically, connecting Kuei Ping's present at the jewel shop with her past at the mission school. However, the transition between the two scenes feels a bit abrupt. When the narrative jumps to her memory of graduation day, it's not fully signaled, which might confuse readers. Also, some parts like the description of the street and the shop could be more integrated into the main plot. The themes of tradition vs. freedom are clear, but the shift in scenes could be smoother. So Coherence might score a 4 as well, but maybe 3.5 if the transitions are considered more problematic.

Wait, let me check again. The transition from the jewel shop to the memory is sudden. The author uses "With a suddenness..." which tries to signal the shift, but it's still abrupt. That's a coherence issue. Also, some paragraphs are quite long without clear breaks, which might affect structure. But overall, the narrative is mostly coherent with a clear progression. So maybe Coherence is 4, but the abrupt transition is a notable issue. Alternatively, if the structure is considered to have noticeable shifts, it could be 3.5. I think 4 is more accurate because despite the transition, the overall coherence is maintained.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor grammar and phrasing issues), Coherence 4 (mostly logical but some abrupt transitions).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "sat passively quiet" (should be "sat quietly")  
- [LEXICON] "small store of English words" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "have shown respect" (subject-verb error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from jewel shop to graduation memory (lacks clear signaling)  
- [STRUCTURE] Extended descriptive paragraphs disrupt narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
