Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite detailed and descriptive, written in a formal, possibly early 20th-century style. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. Checking for grammar, syntax, and spelling issues. I noticed a few typos like "shoulded" instead of "should," "am being" which should be "were being." Also, some phrases like "the outlines ol which" should be "of." These are minor but present. The phrasing is mostly natural, but the long sentences could make it a bit awkward for modern readers. So Fluency might be a 4 because it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text is structured chronologically, following the expedition's journey. Each section connects logically—describing the landscape, meeting the Yögurs, their customs, etc. However, there are abrupt jumps between topics, like moving from geography to village details without clear transitions. Some parts feel like lists (e.g., house descriptions, clothing details) which disrupt the flow. Also, the legend about their origins and the tax information might not be fully integrated. The narrative is generally clear, but the lack of smooth transitions and some disjointed sections would lower the score. Maybe a 3.5 because it's coherent overall but has noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "shoulded" (should be "should"), "ol" (should be "of"), "am being" (subject-verb agreement).  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thickly bestrewn," "scanty").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between geographic descriptions, cultural observations, and historical legends.  
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, repetitive descriptions (e.g., clothing, utensils) disrupt narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit links between paragraphs (e.g., jump from village layout to tax administration).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
