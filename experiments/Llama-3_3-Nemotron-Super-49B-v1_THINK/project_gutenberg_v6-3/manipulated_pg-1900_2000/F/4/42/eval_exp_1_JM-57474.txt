Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, each with their own criteria and scales. The output needs to be in a specific format with bullet points for issues and scores.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an old socialist pamphlet, so the language might be formal and less modern. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon issues. Scanning through, I notice "I am now going to spoke" should be "speak"—that's a grammar error. Also, "it may seemed" instead of "it may seem". There's "the masses was" which should be "were". "If you prick us, do we not bleed?" is a quote, so maybe that's intentional, but the rest of the sentence structure seems okay. Some long sentences might affect readability, but overall, the text is understandable despite some archaic phrasing and minor errors. So Fluency score might be around 4, since the issues are minor but present.

Now Coherence. The text argues that socialist women's suffrage is based on economic conditions, contrasting with middle-class approaches. The structure seems logical, moving from stating their stance, comparing with others, historical examples, and concluding their point. However, there are abrupt transitions, like jumping between historical events and theoretical points without clear connectors. Also, some paragraphs are lengthy and dense, making the flow a bit hard. The main idea is clear, but the execution has some disjointedness. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but with some weaknesses.

Wait, let me check again. For Fluency, the errors are noticeable but don't hinder understanding much. So 4. For Coherence, the transitions could be smoother, and the historical examples, while relevant, might feel a bit disconnected. Maybe a 3.5? Because the coherence is generally there but with more significant interruptions. Hmm, the scale says 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues". The text has some abrupt shifts and lengthy paragraphs, so maybe 3.5 is right. 

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor errors, mostly fluent), Coherence 3.5 (some transitions and structure issues but overall clear).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "spoke" instead of "speak" (verb conjugation error)  
- [SPELLING] "seamed" instead of "seem" (typo)  
- [SYNTAX] "the masses was" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing (e.g., "Comrades,—", "it is well for us")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical examples and theoretical arguments (e.g., Shakespeare quote to capitalist critique)  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with unclear paragraph-level focus  
- [LOGIC] Repetitive contrasts with middle-class suffrage without explicit thematic resolution  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
