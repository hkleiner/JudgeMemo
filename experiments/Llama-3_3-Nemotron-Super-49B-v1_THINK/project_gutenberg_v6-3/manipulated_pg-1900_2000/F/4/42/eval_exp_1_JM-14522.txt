Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence using the specified criteria.

First, Fluency. The text is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which is a classic. So, I expect high fluency. But I need to check for any grammatical, spelling, syntax, or lexicon issues. Scanning through, I notice a few possible errors. For example, "you was certainly very natural in America" should be "you were". Also, "he never ceased to regretted" has a double past tense. "Qualify himself" might be "qualified". "I have always am of opinion" should be "I have always been". These are minor but noticeable. The language is mostly smooth, so Fluency score is probably 4.5, deducting for those minor issues.

Next, Coherence. The story unfolds logically, each chapter connects well. The dialogue and events follow a clear structure. However, there's a shift from the family's skepticism to encountering the ghost without much transition in Chapter II. Also, some parts like the conversation topics before the ghost appears might feel a bit disconnected, but overall, it's coherent. Maybe a score of 4.5 here too, but need to check if the transitions are smooth enough. The abrupt appearance of the ghost after a normal evening might be a slight issue, but it's intentional for the plot. So Coherence is 4.5 as well.

Wait, the user's text might have more errors since it's a transcription. Let me check again. Oh, the original text by Wilde is known for its humor and structure. Assuming the provided text is accurate, the minor errors I found would affect Fluency slightly. For Coherence, the narrative is well-structured, so only minor deductions. Hence, both scores at 4.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "you was" instead of "you were" (subject-verb agreement)  
- [LEXICON] "qualify himself" (should be "qualified")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have always am of opinion" (tense inconsistency)  
- [SPELLING/GRAMMAR] Minor archaic phrasing (e.g., "was certainly very natural")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from skepticism to ghost encounter (Chapter II) without clear buildup  
- [STRUCTURE] Slightly disconnected subplots (e.g., conversation topics before ghost appearance)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
