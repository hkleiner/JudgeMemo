Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues related to fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, which might make it a bit hard to read, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue. Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice some typos like "brlongs" (should be "belongs"), "succesw" (success), "Albeft" (Albrecht), "prunting" (printing), "mqrgin" (margin), "endd" (ends), "othee" (other), "jot" (job), "draughtmab's" (draughtsman's). These are clear spelling mistakes. Also, some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the sentence starting "Now it may surprise some of our readerw..." has a typo ("readerw") and is quite convoluted. 

For coherence, the text seems well-structured overall, discussing early woodcut books, specific printers, and their works. However, there are some transitions that feel abrupt. For instance, the shift from talking about Augsburg printers to Ulm's later school with Leonard Hol's Ptolemy might need a smoother connection. Also, the paragraph about claiming the title of works of art feels a bit disconnected from the preceding list of books. There's repetition in mentioning certain printers and books multiple times without clear progression. The text assumes some background knowledge about the period and artists, which could make it less clear for someone unfamiliar.

So for fluency, the main issues are spelling errors and long, complex sentences. For coherence, abrupt transitions and some disjointed sections. Scoring: Fluency would be around 3.5 because while there are errors, the text is mostly readable. Coherence maybe 4 since the structure is generally logical but has some weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "brlongs", "succesw", "Albeft", "prunting", "mqrgin", "endd", "othee", "jot", "draughtmab's"). - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Now it may surprise..."). - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("mediæval", "rhetorical pedants") may impede modern readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., shift from Augsburg to Ulm’s later school). - [CLARITY] Assumes specialized knowledge (e.g., Renaissance impact, printer names). - [TRANSITION] Repetitive mentions of printers/books without clear progression.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
