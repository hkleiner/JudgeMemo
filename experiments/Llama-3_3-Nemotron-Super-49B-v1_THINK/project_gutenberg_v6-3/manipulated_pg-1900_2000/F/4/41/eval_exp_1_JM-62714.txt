Okay, let me tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text has a lot of typos and spelling errors. Words like "plsyed" instead of "played", "dollw" for "dolls", "scholl" instead of "school", "Dejght" missing an 'l', "abd" for "and", "nezt" for "next", "dlor" for "door", "dis yeah" which should be "this here", "heaven" misspelled as "heben", "certaknly" for "certainly", "tomneed" instead of "tomorrow needed", "sidwboards" missing a 'b', "recklesslt" for "recklessly", "svalloped" maybe "scalloped", "yku" for "you", "vand" instead of "and", "selefted" for "selected", "ot" instead of "it", "tehm" for "them", "whanging" perhaps "hammering", "ntube" for "tube", "withn" not present but maybe a typo. These are all over the place. The grammar and syntax seem mostly okay despite the typos, but the frequent spelling mistakes would distract a reader. So for Fluency, even though the structure is mostly clear, the numerous typos drag the score down. Maybe a 3.5 because while it's readable, the errors are frequent.

Now Coherence. The story flows logically from Betsey's play to her getting the dollhouse and then playing with it. Each part connects: the preface introduces her play style, then the mom orders the house, Betsey's excitement, and the detailed play scenario. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like when Tom appears with the molding or when the father brings the stamp box. These feel a bit sudden without transition. Also, some parts might be a bit repetitive in how the dolls interact, but overall the narrative is clear. The structure is mostly logical, so Coherence might be a 4, as the main flow is good but minor disconnects exist.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Numerous consistent spelling errors (e.g., "plsyed", "dollw", "scholl", "Dejght", "abd", "nezt", "dlor", "dis yeah", "heben", "certaknly", "recklesslt", "svalloped", "yku", "vand", "selefted", "ot", "whanging", "ntube").  
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "for it did seem too bad to keep them packed away im their dark, stuffy box").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor abrupt transitions (e.g., Tom’s sudden appearance with molding, Father’s stamp-box introduction).  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive doll-scenario dialogues slightly disrupt narrative focus.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
