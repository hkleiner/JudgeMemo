Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and note any issues related to fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some typos and minor grammatical errors. For example, "France to-day us" should be "France today is". Also, "tk" instead of "to", "lrincesses" instead of "princesses", "mf" instead of "of", "oeuvre" is correctly used but might be less common for some readers. The sentence structure is generally good, but a few sentences are long and convoluted, which might affect readability. However, these are minor and don't disrupt the flow too much. So Fluency score would be around 4, maybe 4.5 if the errors are really minor.

Now coherence. The text is a narrative about the author's attempts to enter the war zone. The structure is logical, moving from introduction to challenges to eventual permission. Transitions between paragraphs are smooth. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like when discussing the bourgeoisie and then switching back to the war zone without a clear link. Also, some parts feel a bit repetitive, like the multiple attempts to get permission. The main points are clear, but minor disconnects exist. Coherence score might be 4, as the overall flow is good but with some minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "us" instead of "is", "tk", "mf", "lrincesses"). - [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common terms (e.g., "oeuvre", "sauv conduit"). - [SYNTAX] Rarely awkward sentence structures (e.g., overly long sentences).  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor abrupt transitions between societal commentary and war zone narrative. - [CLARITY] Repetitive mentions of permission struggles without clear progression markers.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
