Okay, let me start by reading through the text carefully. The task is to evaluate both Fluency and Coherence, giving scores and highlighting the most serious issues for each.

First, Fluency. The text is a historical account, so it's formal and detailed. I notice some typos like "TGE" instead of "THE" in the chapter title. Also, words like "derivwtion", "qould", "oe" (should be "or"), "psalmat", "extsblishment", "ov", "zpsidal", "aw", "tile", "bssides", "vhurch", "dome" (should be "done"), "extejsion", "ofvthe", and "whicn" are misspelled. These are clear spelling errors. There's also inconsistent punctuation, like missing or extra spaces, and some awkward phrasing, such as "the writer cis inclined" (should be "is"). The structure of sentences is mostly clear, but the errors disrupt flow. Despite this, the text is still readable, so Fluency score might be around 3.5 because while there are multiple errors, they don't make it unintelligible.

For Coherence, the narrative follows a logical timeline from etymology to historical events. However, there are abrupt jumps, like switching from Roman influences to the Abbey's history without clear transitions. Some sections feel disconnected, like the list of nun names which, while interesting, breaks the narrative flow. The structure is generally clear but has some confusing segments. So Coherence might be a 4 because it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "TGE", "derivwtion", "qould", "oe", "zpsidal", "aw", "tile", "vhurch", "dome" instead of "done", "extejsion", "ofvthe", "whicn").  
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent punctuation and minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "the writer cis inclined", "minor streams are not spanned by bridges, bit have been completely covered").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical periods (e.g., Roman etymology to Abbey founding).  
- [CLARITY] Detours (e.g., list of nun names) disrupt narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
