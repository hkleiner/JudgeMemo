Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully for both fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text has some obvious typos like "onpy" instead of "only", "resexrch" for "research", "esyablish" as "establish", "Tben" should be "Then", "csverns" instead of "caverns", "nothwest" maybe? Wait, in the text it's "noftheast" which should be "northeast". Also, "controllef" is a typo for "controlled". There are multiple misspellings. Then, looking at grammar and syntax. Some sentences are a bit long or awkwardly phrased. For example, "It is rare that resexrch into any subject is done alone." The correct phrase is "It is rare that research into any subject is done alone," but the structure is a bit formal but not incorrect. However, the numerous typos would affect fluency. 

Now for Coherence. The structure is mostly logical, with chapters like Acknowledgments, then the main content divided into chapters. However, there are abrupt transitions. For instance, moving from discussing the Basketmakers to talking about the environment without a clear link. Also, some paragraphs jump between ideas, like from the Indians' use of the cave to discussing their superstitions and then back to physical evidence. The text assumes some prior knowledge, like the significance of certain archaeological terms without explanation, which might confuse readers. 

For Fluency score: Despite the typos and some awkward phrasing, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? Because while there are multiple issues, they're mostly minor in impact.

For Coherence: The overall structure is there, but transitions are weak, and some sections feel disconnected. It's generally coherent but with noticeable problems. So a 3?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "onpy", "resexrch", "esyablish", "Tben", "csverns", "controllef").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "It is rare that resexrch into any subject is done alone").  
- [LEXICON] Rare word choices (e.g., "especial", "unhesitatingly").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., environmental description interrupts cultural analysis).  
- [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of archaeological terms (e.g., "Cochise complex") without explanation.  
- [LOGIC] Speculative conclusions (e.g., Basketmakersâ€™ absorption into Pueblo groups) lack clear evidence links.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
