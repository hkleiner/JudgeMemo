Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The first thing I notice is the writing style, which seems quite formal and old-fashioned. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the opening sentences have multiple clauses that make them a bit dense. There are some grammatical issues, like "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" which should probably be "sat quietly." Also, in the part where it says "Wong each, with, the both chess which slowly ’s his toward yield at Lui each too carefully loved dearly of the players and, measuring to skill game, quoted from they power hisso the seasoned goal moved was other price." This part is really confusing and looks like a typo or a major sentence structure error. It disrupts the flow a lot.

Now, checking for coherence. The story has a clear structure: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the family's visit, the jewel selection, and then a flashback to Kuei Ping's school days. However, the transition to the memory of the mission school feels a bit abrupt. The paragraph starting with "It was graduation day" comes out of nowhere without a clear connection to the previous scene. Also, some parts have unclear transitions, like when Kuei Ping is holding the pearls and then suddenly remembers the mission school. The conflict between her desires and family obligations is clear, but the shift in scenes could be smoother.

For fluency score, despite the complex sentences and a few errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 4? But the confusing sentence in the bargaining part might lower it to 3.5.

For coherence, the main issue is the abrupt transition to the flashback. The rest of the narrative flows logically, but that jump disrupts the coherence. So coherence might be a 4 because the overall structure is clear, but the transition weakens it a bit.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences (e.g., opening paragraphs)  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "sat passively quiet," inconsistent verb tense in flashbacks)  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "whilst") and unclear phrasing (e.g., "Wong each...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to graduation memory without clear contextual link  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., pearls → mission school flashback)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
