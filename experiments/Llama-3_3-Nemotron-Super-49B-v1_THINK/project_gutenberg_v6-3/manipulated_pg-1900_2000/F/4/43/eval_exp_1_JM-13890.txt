Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and analyze both fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and spelling. I notice some long sentences, like in Chapter I where the description of Henry VIII's writ is quite lengthy. That might affect readability, but it's not a major error. There's also a part in Chapter II where the sentence structure gets a bit convoluted, like the paragraph discussing the Roman occupation and the transition to Saxon Canterbury. The vocabulary is rich but appropriate. I didn't spot any spelling mistakes, but there's a possible typo in "PalÃ¦olithic" which should be "Palaeolithic" without the accent. Also, in the last paragraph of Chapter II, there's a jumbled sentence: "Perhaps site Saxon until the Martin it early 's, very on part discoveries St. will seems but standing inby of as be a solved very wiser problem Roman, the further then restored regard probably building to being the church." That's clearly a mistake, maybe a formatting error or a missing part. This disrupts fluency significantly.

For coherence, the text is generally logical. Chapter I sets up the historical context of Canterbury, and Chapter II delves into its history. However, there's a transition between the two chapters that feels a bit abrupt. The first chapter talks about the last pilgrimage and modern pilgrims, then Chapter II jumps into ancient history without a clear link. Also, in Chapter II, the discussion shifts between Roman times, Saxon invasions, and Christianization. While mostly logical, some paragraphs feel like they're listing historical facts without smooth transitions. The part about the church of St. Martin's has conflicting views from antiquaries, which is presented clearly but might confuse some readers due to the uncertainty.

So, for fluency, the main issues are the long sentences, the typo, and the jumbled sentence. Despite these, the text is mostly fluent, so maybe a 4.5? But the jumbled part is a big issue, so maybe 4?

For coherence, the abrupt chapter transition and some disjointed historical sections. But overall, it's coherent, so maybe a 4?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., Chapter I’s historical narrative).  
- [SPELLING] Typographical error (e.g., "PalÃ¦olithic").  
- [LEXICON] Jumbled, incoherent sentence in Chapter II (e.g., "Perhaps site Saxon until the Martin...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I (pilgrimage theme) and Chapter II (historical chronology).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear resolution of conflicting antiquarian views on St. Martin’s church.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
