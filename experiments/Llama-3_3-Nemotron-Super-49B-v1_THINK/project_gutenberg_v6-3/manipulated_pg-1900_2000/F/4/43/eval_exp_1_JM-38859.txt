Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text's Fluency and Coherence on a Likert scale with half-points. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues in each category.

Starting with Fluency. The text is a historical account of Civil War experiences. The structure is mostly chronological, which is good. But I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, the part about the dance at Mr. Sphink's has a lot of clauses. That might affect readability. Also, there are a few places with awkward phrasing, like "we of the war exchange were to Col who. months, brigade few with from for ably commanded time..." That sentence seems garbled, maybe a typo or missing words. Spelling and grammar seem mostly okay, but there's "ministering to a Michigan soldier who was wounded in the same manner the Johnny was" – "Johnny" here is informal but acceptable in a personal account. Punctuation is generally fine, but some sentences are very long, which could disrupt flow.

Now for Coherence. The overall structure is clear, following the author's experiences in order. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For instance, moving from the dance story to marching to Franklin without a clear link. Also, the part about the monument on Snodgrass ridge feels a bit disconnected from the preceding paragraph. There's repetition in describing the battle of Chickamauga, especially the percentage of casualties (37% vs 40% in the adjutant general's report), which might confuse the reader. The story about the Rebel soldier and the warning seems important but is inserted without a smooth transition. The text jumps around a bit in the final paragraphs, like the incident with Doctor Githens' spur and the shoe issue, which feels tacked on.

For Fluency score: Despite some complex sentences and one major structural issue (the garbled sentence), the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? It's generally fluent but with multiple minor issues.

Coherence score: The narrative has logical progression overall, but there are several abrupt shifts and some unclear connections between sections. The repetition about casualties and the tacked-on stories reduce coherence. So around 3.5 as well? It's coherent but with noticeable problems.

Wait, let me check the scales again. For Fluency, a 3 is "generally readable with multiple grammatical issues interrupting flow." The main issues here are sentence complexity and that one messed-up sentence. Maybe 3.5 because while there are issues, they don't make it hard to understand overall. For Coherence, a 3 is "generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts." The transitions are sometimes weak, and there's repetition, so 3.5 might be too high. Maybe 3?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "we of the war exchange were to Col who...").  
- [LEXICON] Informal/inconsistent terminology (e.g., "Johnny" for Confederates, inconsistent formality).  
- [STRUCTURE] One severely garbled sentence ("we of the war exchange...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts (e.g., dance story to Franklin march; shoe injury to horse care).  
- [LOGIC] Repetitive casualty percentages (37% vs. 40%) without clarification.  
- [STRUCTURE] Tacked-on anecdotes (e.g., Dr. Githens’ spur, negro boy "Jack") disrupting flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
