Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text's fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. 

First, I'll start with Fluency. The text is from an older style, maybe 19th or early 20th century. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I notice some archaic phrases like "the worthy tipstaff's writing done" or "the sand being flung upon the wet ink." These are grammatically correct but use formal, outdated language. There's also a part that seems garbled: "Then be with child, for about women Saturday..." That looks like a typo or a missing section. It disrupts the flow. Also, some transitions between sentences feel abrupt, like jumping from the child's birth to the war news without smooth connections. 

For Coherence, the overall structure is chronological, following Boucher's life. However, there are abrupt shifts, like the sudden mention of Jeanne Poisson without clear connection to the immediate context. The text assumes some historical knowledge, like the events in France, which might confuse readers not familiar with the period. There's also repetition in emphasizing Boucher's prodigy status, which could be streamlined. The part about Watteau's influence feels a bit tacked on without a clear link to the preceding paragraph.

Fluency score: The text is mostly readable despite archaic language and some awkward phrasing. The major issue is the garbled sentence, but overall, it's understandable. So maybe a 4? But the errors, though not frequent, are noticeable. Maybe 3.5 because while it's generally fluent, the archaic style and the one major error bring it down.

Coherence score: The structure is mostly logical, but there are disconnected parts and assumptions of background knowledge. The jumps between historical events and Boucher's life could be smoother. So perhaps a 3.5 as well, since it's generally coherent but has notable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "vestry of the parish church," "stilted manner of good-fellowship") may impede modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Extremely long, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., first paragraph of "THE SMALL BEGINNINGS").  
- [GRAMMAR] Apparent typo/error in sentence fragment: "Then be with child, for about women Saturday..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context (e.g., wars, royal events) and Boucher’s personal narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with 18th-century French history and artistic movements without contextualization.  
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur introduction of Jeanne Poisson’s birth without clear immediate relevance to Boucher’s storyline.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
