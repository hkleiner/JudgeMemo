Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any fluency and coherence issues. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some spots where the syntax might be a bit awkward or word choice could be improved. For example, in the first chapter, the sentence "In corner I dwellings, plot been vacant a a high found at of, surrounded where ground a demolished walls squalid-insanitary had by strewn brick street." This seems jumbled. The word order is off, and there are repeated words ("a a"). That's a syntax issue. Also, "the attentions shabby, camp were they, altogether foreign neighbours but-brought that and into glory of out from," is confusing. The structure here is unclear, maybe missing some words or improperly punctuated. These are major syntax problems affecting readability.

For Coherence, the overall structure is logical, but there are transitions that could be smoother. Like when moving from describing the Gypsies' camp to Kola's character in Chapter 2, the connection feels a bit abrupt. The text jumps from the scene in Liverpool to Kola's background without a clear link. Also, some paragraphs in Chapter 2, like the part about Kola's contract and dealing with customers, might feel a tad disjointed from the rest. The ideas are connected, but the flow could be better.

Scoring Fluency: Despite some errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt heavily. So maybe a 4? But wait, those syntax issues in the first chapter are pretty bad. They interrupt the flow. So maybe 3.5? Because while most of it is fluent, those parts are significant.

Coherence: The story unfolds logically, but there are some weak transitions and abrupt shifts. For example, the shift from the camp scene to Kola's detailed description feels sudden. Also, the part where they move to Birkenhead and then the spectator in Tranmere might need clearer connections. However, the overall narrative is clear. So Coherence might be a 4, as the issues are minor but present.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentence structure (e.g., "In corner I dwellings...") with word repetition and unclear word order.  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the attentions shabby...") causing confusion.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Chapter 1’s scene to Chapter 2’s detailed character focus on Kola.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness in paragraphs (e.g., contract/customers section in Chapter 2 feels slightly disconnected).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
