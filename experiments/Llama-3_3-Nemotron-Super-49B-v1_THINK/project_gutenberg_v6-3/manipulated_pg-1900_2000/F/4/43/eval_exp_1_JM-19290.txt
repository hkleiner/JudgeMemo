Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence using the provided criteria. 

First, I'll start with Fluency. The text is well-structured with proper grammar and punctuation. The sentences are mostly clear and natural. However, there are a couple of spots where the wording feels a bit awkward. For example, the line "For to decades, has languages people’s several writings translation everywhere eight hundred program fromselections accessible systematic in publication and, of a made Bahá’u’lláh over." This part seems jumbled with incorrect word order and missing articles. It looks like a typo or a missing space between "fromselections" which should be "from selections". Also, "For to decades" should probably be "For decades". These errors disrupt the flow a bit. Despite that, the overall fluency is good, so maybe a 4.5? But since there are noticeable issues in a couple of places, maybe 4?

Now for Coherence. The text is organized into chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of Bahá’u’lláh's life. The ideas transition smoothly from one section to another. However, there's a part in "BIRTH OF A NEW REVELATION" where the transition from discussing the Báb's movement to Bahá’u’lláh's imprisonment feels a bit abrupt. The connection between the two could be clearer. Also, some paragraphs are quite long, which might make following the narrative a bit challenging, but it's manageable. The logical flow is generally strong, so Coherence might score a 4.5 as well, but the abrupt transition and long paragraphs might bring it down to 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in scattered sentences (e.g., "For to decades, has languages people’s several writings...").  
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor typos (e.g., "fromselections" instead of "from selections").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the Báb’s movement and Bahá’u’lláh’s imprisonment (Chapter 3).  
- [TRANSITION] Long paragraphs with dense historical/contextual detail may disrupt flow for casual readers.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
