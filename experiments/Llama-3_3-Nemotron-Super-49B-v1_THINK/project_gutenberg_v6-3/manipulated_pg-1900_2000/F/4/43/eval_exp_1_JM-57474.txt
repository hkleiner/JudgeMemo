Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the Fluency and Coherence of the given text.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older period, probably early 20th century given the references to Social-Democracy and historical events. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. I notice long, complex sentences which might affect readability. For example, the first paragraph has a very long sentence that's a bit hard to follow. There's also some repetition in phrases like "we should not be... if we did not..." which could be more concise. However, the grammar and spelling seem correct for the most part. The main issues here are syntax and phrasing due to the lengthy sentences and somewhat outdated vocabulary, but no major grammatical errors. So Fluency might be a 4 because while it's mostly clear, the structure and word choice cause some minor disruptions.

Now Coherence. The text has a clear argument contrasting Social-Democrat views on woman suffrage with middle-class approaches. The structure moves from stating the urgency, explaining their basis on capitalist production, comparing with middle-class views, and historical examples. However, there are abrupt transitions, like jumping from discussing property rights to quoting Shakespeare without a smooth connection. Also, some paragraphs feel a bit disjointed, and the footnote seems out of place without clear integration. The historical references, while relevant, might confuse readers not familiar with them. Despite this, the overall logic is there, but with noticeable shifts. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the main points connect, the transitions and some sections disrupt the flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences impair readability.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "Comrades," "thou").  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive sentence openings (e.g., "We...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts (e.g., Shakespeare quote lacks contextual bridge).  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-integrated footnote disrupts flow.  
- [CLARITY] Assumed historical knowledge (e.g., "Louis Capet") may confuse readers.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
