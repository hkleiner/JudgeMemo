Okay, let me tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to assess the Fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The given text is from "The Discovery of the Future" by H.G. Wells, which is early 20th-century writing. 

Looking at the text, the sentences are long and complex, which was common back then. I notice some archaic vocabulary like "æsthetic" and phrases such as "the yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are." Wait, that part seems a bit jumbled. Let me check: "Things have been, says the legal mind, and so we are here. The yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are." Hmm, the second sentence here looks like a mistake. It might be a typo or a formatting error. The original text probably had a dash or indentation to separate the two types of minds, but in the provided version, it's run together incorrectly. That's a clear syntax issue.

Also, there's a part later: "In two work looking equally out affairs incompatible of things divergent ways at also public sphere into the and these of consequences." This sentence is completely garbled. It seems like a jumbled mix of words, possibly a scanning error or a missing part. That's a major syntax and coherence problem.

For Fluency, despite the complex sentences being typical of the era, the errors like the jumbled sentences and possible typos (like "æsthetic" might be intentional as a variant spelling) affect the score. The main issues are the clearly erroneous sentences which disrupt flow. So Fluency would be a 4 because although there are some errors, the text is mostly fluent except for those specific glitches.

Now for Coherence. The text discusses two types of minds and their approaches to time. The structure is clear, contrasting the legal and creative minds, with examples and a logical progression. However, there's a sudden jump in the middle with the garbled sentence "In two work..." which breaks the coherence. Also, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, but overall the argument is well-structured. The main issue is that corrupted sentence which disrupts the flow. Coherence score would be 4 as well, since the main structure is logical but there's a significant disruption.

Wait, but the user mentioned "In two work looking..." which seems like a severe error. If that's part of the original text, it's a big problem. But maybe it's a transcription error. Assuming it's part of the text given, that's a major coherence and fluency issue. However, in the original Wells text, that sentence doesn't exist. So perhaps the user provided a corrupted version. But as an annotator, I have to evaluate the text as given.

So for Fluency, the jumbled sentences are major issues. The first flawed sentence ("The yet...") and the later "In two work..." are both syntax and structure problems. These would deduct from fluency. But the rest of the text, although archaic, is fluent. So maybe Fluency is 3.5? Because those errors are significant but not pervasive.

For Coherence, the overall structure is clear, but the corrupted sentences cause confusion. The example about promises and the transition to sexual morality might feel a bit abrupt, but generally, the text flows logically. The main problem is the disrupted sentence. So Coherence might be 4, deducting for the disruption but overall coherence maintained.

Wait, but the evaluation criteria for Coherence score 4 says "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The corrupted sentence is a strong part, but if the rest holds, maybe 4 is okay. Alternatively, if the error is severe enough, it could drop to 3.5. But since the rest of the text is well-structured, I'll go with 4 for Coherence and 3.5 for Fluency due to the specific errors.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentences (e.g., "The yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are," "In two work looking equally out affairs...").  
- [SPELLING/LEXICON] Archaisms ("æsthetic") and potential transcription errors.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, corrupted sentence disrupts logical flow ("In two work looking...").  
- [TRANSITION] Minor abruptness in shifts (e.g., from promises to sexual morality).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
