Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues related to fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some noticeable errors. For example, in the line "The not break separation did off their intercourse." That doesn't make sense. It should probably be "The separation did not break off their intercourse." So that's a grammar issue. Also, "If an least was, this fortune not a assured at living." That's confusing. Maybe "If at least this fortune was not assured for living." These are clear syntax and grammar problems. There's also "Being boyish own doubt she her retained the destined without, of up to and with mark to owes which manners..." which is a jumbled sentence. Needs better structure. 

For coherence, the text jumps around a bit. Like when it mentions the Silvela family leaving Bordeaux and then later talks about Raymond moving to Paris. The connection between these events could be smoother. Also, when describing Rosa's time in the boys' school, the transition to her playing in Place Royale feels a bit abrupt. There's a part where it says "The years which followed were equally unfortunate..." but it's not clear how the cholera and moving relate directly to the narrative flow. Some sections feel like a list of events without strong linking. 

Scoring fluency: There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the text is mostly readable. So maybe a 3.5? Because while there are issues, they don't make it unintelligible. 

Coherence: The overall structure is there, but there are abrupt shifts and some lack of clear transitions. So maybe a 3? It's generally coherent but with noticeable problems.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The not break separation did off their intercourse." (illogical phrase structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "If an least was, this fortune not a assured at living." (incomprehensible syntax)  
- [SYNTAX] "Being boyish own doubt she her retained the destined without..." (jumbled sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Raymond’s move to Paris and the family’s struggles (lacks explicit causal connection)  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Rosa’s school expulsion to her artistic development (no bridging sentence)  
- [LOGIC] Unexplained leap from Raymond’s death (implied but not stated) to Rosa’s later artistic philosophy  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
