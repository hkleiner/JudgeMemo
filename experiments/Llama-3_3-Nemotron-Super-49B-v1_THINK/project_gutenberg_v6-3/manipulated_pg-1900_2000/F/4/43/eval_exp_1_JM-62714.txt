Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some parts that are a bit confusing. For example, in the Preface, there's a sentence that seems garbled: "But Mrs.too to too, bad Betsey dolls keep play and away who to Darling was sister ’s box Anne for to, old their with stuffy away given more Mr., Betsey and had them much in school it dark who at packed was seem, did any." That's clearly a syntax and grammar issue. Also, some sentences are long and a bit awkward, like when Betsey is making the telephone. The structure is mostly okay, but those errors deduct points. 

For Coherence, the story flows logically. The chapters connect well, showing Betsey's play and then the dollhouse. However, there are abrupt jumps, like when Tom appears with the molding without introduction. Also, some parts feel repetitive, like the constant role-playing which, while clear, might make the narrative a bit disjointed. The transitions between scenes could be smoother, but overall, it's easy to follow.

So, Fluency score would be around 3.5 because despite the major error in the Preface and some awkward phrasing, the rest is readable. Coherence is maybe 4 since the main structure is good but has minor issues with transitions and some abrupt scenes.
