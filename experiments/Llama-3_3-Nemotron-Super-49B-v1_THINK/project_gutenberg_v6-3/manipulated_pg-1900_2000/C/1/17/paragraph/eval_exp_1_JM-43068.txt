Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues related to fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is formal and uses complex sentences, which is good, but there might be some archaic language. Words like "whilst," "betwixt," and "thou" could make it less fluent for modern readers. Also, checking for grammar and syntax errors. I noticed "a long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet" – "betwixt" is old-fashioned but correct. Maybe some commas are missing or misplaced, but overall grammar seems okay. 

For coherence, the text jumps between different topics: from Millet to Brueghel, then to political context in France and England, and suddenly mentions Bahá’u’lláh and Dr. Johnson. These transitions might be abrupt. The section about Bahá’u’lláh seems out of place entirely. Also, the part about Dr. Johnson and Reynolds doesn't clearly connect to Millet. The structure lacks a clear flow, making it hard to follow the main argument. 

Now, categorizing the issues. For fluency, the main problem is LEXICON due to outdated vocabulary. Maybe some minor syntax issues, but not major. For coherence, TRANSITION issues because of abrupt shifts, and STRUCTURE since the topics aren't well-connected. The Bahá’u’lláh paragraph is a big disruptor. 

Scoring: Fluency is mostly good but with some minor deductions for archaic terms, so maybe 4. Coherence has more serious issues with structure and transitions, so around 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaisms ("betwixt", "whilst") and overly formal tone may impede modern readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh insertion, Dr. Johnson detour). - [STRUCTURE] Non-sequiturs disrupt thematic flow (e.g., political commentary unrelated to Millet).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
