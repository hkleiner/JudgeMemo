Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and academic. I notice long, complex sentences. For example, the paragraph about Boucher has a sentence that's a bit convoluted: "He won them; for, in this his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris." The semicolon and structure might make it slightly awkward. Also, there are some outdated terms or phrasing, like "prodigious effort" which is formal but not an error. Checking for grammar, spelling, punctuation—there don't seem to be major errors. Maybe some commas could be adjusted, but overall, it's well-structured. The language is sophisticated, which might affect readability but not fluency per se. So Fluency is probably high, maybe 4 or 4.5. The main issue is sentence complexity, but no major errors.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between different topics. The first part talks about Boucher, then switches to the author's methodology, then to historical economic analysis, and mentions artists again later. There's a section about death rates and Factory Acts that feels abrupt. The transition from discussing medieval capitalism to artists seems unrelated. The structure isn't linear; ideas are connected thematically but not smoothly. However, within each section, the logic holds. The author refers back to earlier points, like the thesis about capitalism's age. So Coherence is affected by abrupt topic shifts but maintains internal logic in sections. Maybe a 3 or 3.5.

Wait, the Coherence scale says Score 3 is generally coherent but with noticeable issues. The text has some disconnects but overall follows a thematic discussion on capitalism's stages. The abrupt jumps (like from artists to medieval economy) are issues. So Coherence might be 3.5. Fluency, despite complex sentences, is mostly fluent with minor phrasing issues, so 4.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "He won them; for, in this his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris.")  
   - [LEXICON] Archaic or formal phrasing (e.g., "prodigious effort," "doggedly bending his will and hand")  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., Boucher → methodology → medieval capitalism → artists)  
   - [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connectors between disparate historical and thematic sections  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
