Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the Fluency and Coherence of the given text.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and uses complex sentences, which is good, but I need to check for errors. The first thing I notice is the use of "coöperation" with the diaeresis. That's correct in some contexts, like the original spelling, but in modern English, it's usually "cooperation." However, since the text is titled "-THE ETHICS OF COÖPERATION-", it might be intentional for stylistic or historical reasons. So maybe that's not an error here. 

Looking through the paragraphs, the sentences are long and structured with proper grammar. I don't see obvious spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is rich, like "santander's caves," "tyrian and florentine," which suggests good lexicology. However, some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might affect readability. For example, the paragraph starting "Agencies for mastery over nature..." has a sentence that's a bit hard to follow due to its length and multiple clauses. But overall, the fluency is high. The only possible issue is the archaic style and long sentences causing slight difficulty, but not enough to deduct much. So Fluency score might be 4 or 4.5.

Now Coherence. The text discusses cooperation, dominance, and competition, contrasting them. The structure moves from historical context to defining terms and then applying them to different groups. There's a clear progression, but some jumps, like the sudden mention of the Báb's execution and then switching back to coöperation types. That part feels a bit disconnected. Also, in Chapter II, the shift to discussing Nicolas Boucher seems out of place unless it's an example, but the connection isn't clearly explained. The ideas are generally logical, but transitions between some paragraphs could be smoother. There's also some repetition in explaining the concepts of cooperation and competition, which might make it slightly less cohesive. However, the overall narrative holds together. So Coherence might score around 4, with some minor issues.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex, lengthy sentences impair readability. - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "coöperation," "santander's caves") may distract modern readers.
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from historical examples (Báb’s execution) to abstract concepts without clear transition. - [TRANSITION] Chapter II introduces unrelated biographical anecdote (Nicolas Boucher) without explicit contextualization.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
