Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any issues with fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are a few spots where the phrasing feels a bit awkward or old-fashioned. For example, "the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe" sounds a bit poetic but maybe a bit forced. Also, some sentence structures are complex and might be hard to follow, like the long descriptive passages about the street and the shop. I should check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I didn't notice any spelling errors, but some sentences are quite long and convoluted, which could affect readability. 

Now, coherence. The story seems to have a clear structure: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the family's visit to buy dowry jewels, and then a flashback to Kuei Ping's time at the mission school. However, the transition to the memory about the mission school feels a bit abrupt. The part about Leicester Square and Reynolds seems completely out of place and unrelated to the rest of the narrative. That's a major coherence issue because it disrupts the flow and doesn't connect to the story. Also, the sudden shift to talking about a character named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson in Paris is jarring and unrelated, which really breaks the coherence.

For fluency, the main issues are some awkward phrasing and complex sentences. For coherence, the abrupt transitions and unrelated paragraphs are the biggest problems. Scoring-wise, fluency might be a 4 because while there are some issues, the text is generally readable. Coherence would be lower, maybe a 3, because those unrelated sections cause significant disruption.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal phrasing (e.g., "passively quiet," "luminous pearls").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected flashback to Leicester Square/Reynolds (disrupts narrative flow).  
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unrelated introduction of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson in Paris (no contextual link).  
- [TRANSITION] Poorly signaled shift from jewel-buying scene to Kuei Pingâ€™s mission school memory.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
