Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate a given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria. I need to follow the instructions strictly without adding any explanations.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to identify issues in both metrics. For Fluency, I'm looking at grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. For Coherence, it's about how the story flows, logical progression, transitions, etc.

Starting with Fluency: The text seems mostly well-written. I notice some long sentences, like the one describing the marshes, which might affect flow. There's a part where "duskier and vaguer" might be a bit awkward, but not a major error. Also, "wheel and hoof over the submerged causeway" – "wheel" here might be a typo for "wagon wheel," but it's unclear. Some phrases like "feeling the Southern swamp-chill busy with his bones" are a bit poetic but not incorrect. The dialogue tags are mostly fine, but there's a switch from "said" to "asked" without quotes in one place, but that's probably intentional. The text includes a sudden switch to talking about Bahá’u’lláh and then cuts back, which is jarring. That's more a coherence issue.

Now Coherence: The narrative jumps abruptly from the wagon scene to a discussion about Sir Joshua Reynolds, then to Bahá’u’lláh, and back. These sections seem unrelated and disrupt the flow. The story starts with Marche and the boy, then introduces unrelated historical figures without connection. The transition between these parts is poor. Also, the character of Miss Herold is introduced without clear connection to previous parts until later. The text mixes different topics (duck hunting, art, religious figures) without smooth transitions, causing confusion.

For Fluency score: Despite some long sentences and minor awkward phrasings, the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues.

For Coherence score: The abrupt jumps between topics and lack of clear connections between sections are major issues. The story lacks a unified structure. So maybe a 2.5 because while some parts flow, the overall coherence is disrupted significantly.

Wait, but the Bahá’u’lláh part seems like a random insertion. That's a big coherence problem. Also, the part about the British Empire progress is another unrelated paragraph. These breaks make the text incoherent. So Coherence might be lower, like 2.

But according to the scale, 2 is frequent inconsistencies, difficult to follow. 3 is noticeable abrupt shifts. Since there are major jumps, maybe 2.5? Or 2? Let me check the criteria again. The example with Bahá’u’lláh and the British Empire sections are completely out of place. That's more than just abrupt shifts; they're unrelated paragraphs. So Coherence score would be 2.

Fluency: The text has some awkward phrasing but no major errors. Score 4.

Coherence: Major issues with unrelated sections. Score 2.

But wait, the user's text includes blocks that seem pasted incorrectly, like the Bahá’u’lláh and the British Empire paragraphs. Are those part of the original text? If so, they disrupt coherence heavily. If it's a mistake, but assuming the text is as given, those sections are problems.

So finalizing:

Fluency Issues: [SYNTAX] Some complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth flow; [LEXICON] occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "duskier and vaguer").
Fluency Score: 4

Coherence Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated sections (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh, British Empire) disrupt narrative flow; [LOGIC] lack of clear transitions between ideas.
Coherence Score: 2

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth flow 
- [LEXICON] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "duskier and vaguer")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated sections (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh, British Empire) disrupt narrative flow 
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear transitions between ideas

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
