Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some noticeable issues. The main one I see is the consistent use of "lisp" in the Irwadian characters' dialogue, like "thith" instead of "this". While this is intentional to show their speech pattern, it might be considered a fluency issue because it's repetitive and could distract some readers. However, since it's a stylistic choice, maybe it's not a major deduction. Then there's the abrupt transition between paragraphs, especially where historical or artistic references pop up out of context, like the Michelangelo and Boucher parts. Those feel disconnected and disrupt the flow. Also, some sentences are a bit long or wordy, like the description of the Irwadian's appearance. But overall, the grammar and syntax are good, so Fluency might score around 4, maybe 4.5 if the lisp is seen as acceptable.

Now Coherence. The story has a clear main plot about the planetarization and its effects on Ramsey. However, there are several sections that seem unrelated. For example, the paragraphs about Michelangelo, Boucher, and Bahá’u’lláh come out of nowhere and don't connect to the rest. These disrupt the narrative flow. Also, the transition between Ramsey's conversation with the Security Officer and the historical notes is jarring. The subplots, like Sally Englander's call or the gambling scene, are mostly integrated but the random historical inserts are major coherence issues. The overall structure is logical except for those inserts, so Coherence might be a 3 or 3.5.

Wait, but the historical parts are probably errors in the text, like copy-paste mistakes. If that's the case, they severely impact coherence. So maybe Coherence is lower, like 2.5. But the user didn't mention errors, just the text as given. So assuming it's intentional, though it's very disruptive. So Coherence score would be 3 because the main story is coherent but with major disruptions.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor issues with lisp and some wordiness), Coherence 3 (major disruptions from unrelated paragraphs).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Intentional but distracting lisp in Irwadian dialogue (e.g., "thith", "lispeth") may disrupt smooth reading.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally wordy or convoluted sentence structures (e.g., descriptions of Irwadian physiology).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unexplained historical/artistic tangents (Michelangelo, Boucher, Bahá’u’lláh) disrupt narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Illogical scene transitions (e.g., historical paragraphs interrupting dialogue).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
