Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the text based on Fluency and Coherence using the given criteria. 

First, I'll start with Fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability. Looking through the chapters, there are long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the first paragraph has sentences that are really long and convoluted, which could make them hard to follow. The vocabulary is also somewhat archaic ("Savages", "superstitious", "wheresoever"), which might be a bit of a barrier for modern readers. However, the grammar and spelling seem correct. There's no obvious errors in punctuation or syntax, but the phrasing is sometimes awkward due to the length and structure of the sentences. So, Fluency might score a 4 because while it's mostly fluent, the complexity and outdated language cause minor issues.

Next, Coherence. The text has clear chapters and each part seems to connect to the topic of Niagara's history and legends. However, there are abrupt transitions. For instance, in the Circular Rainbows chapter, there's a sudden shift to talking about European wars and then back to rainbows without a clear link. Also, some paragraphs meander, like the part about George William Curtis and then jumping to death rates and Factory Acts, which feels unrelated. The structure is generally logical, but these jumps disrupt the flow. So, Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the overall structure is there, the transitions and some tangents cause noticeable issues.

Wait, let me double-check. The Fluency: The archaic terms and long sentences are stylistic but correct. Maybe the fluency is still high despite being formal. Coherence: The chapters are distinct, but within them, there are sections that don't connect well. The example with the European wars seems out of place. That's a major coherence issue. So maybe Coherence is a 3 because there are several spots where the connection between ideas is weak or missing.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent but some minor issues from style), Coherence 3.5 (generally coherent but with some significant disruptions).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("Savages", "wheresoever", "superstitious") may hinder modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences with multiple nested clauses (e.g., first paragraph of Introduction).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing rainbows to European military history (Chapter: CIRCULAR RAINBOWS) without logical connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential references (e.g., death rates and Factory Acts) disrupt thematic focus.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
