Okay, let me start by reading through the text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate both Fluency and Coherence, giving scores from 1 to 5 with half-points. 

First, Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the text, I notice a few things. There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For example, in the first chapter, after discussing the Indians, there's a sudden shift to talking about the Bahá’í Faith, which seems out of place. That's a coherence issue, but maybe also affects fluency if it disrupts the flow. Wait, no, coherence is separate. Fluency is more about sentence-level issues. 

Checking for grammar and spelling: I didn't spot any obvious spelling mistakes. The sentences are mostly structured correctly. However, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might make them a bit hard to follow. For example, the paragraph starting "The Indians living any length of time..." has a long sentence that could be split. Also, there's a part in the Early Man chapter with a paragraph that seems like a philosophical tangent ("There are certain men born to every generation...") which doesn't relate to the topic. That's a coherence issue but might also affect fluency if it's jarring.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps around a lot. The section about European history (French armies, Marlborough) is completely unrelated to the Indians of Carlsbad Caverns. That's a major coherence problem. Also, the transition between chapters isn't always smooth. For example, moving from discussing the Indians' use of the cave to a detailed geological description without clear connection. The text mentions various groups (Apaches, Comanches) without clear explanations of how they connect to the main narrative. There's repetition in some ideas, like the uncertainty about the Indians entering the cave, discussed in multiple places without adding new information.

So for Fluency, the main issues are some complex sentences and the philosophical tangent, but overall it's readable. Maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has minor issues.

For Coherence, the unrelated sections (European history, Bahá’í Faith) are big problems. Also, disjointed ideas and lack of clear structure. That would likely score lower, maybe a 2 or 2.5. 

Wait, let me check the scales again. Fluency score 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." The philosophical paragraph is a bit awkward but doesn't affect the entire text's fluency much. So Fluency: 4.

Coherence: The European history part is a major disruptor. Also, the text lacks a clear logical flow, with abrupt jumps. So Coherence would be 2, as it has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The Indians living any length of time...")  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms ("nought," "wheresoever") and inconsistent tone (philosophical tangent in "Early Man")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Irrelevant historical digressions (e.g., European wars, Bahá’í Faith)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., geology description without contextual transition)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear chronological or thematic linking between sections  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
