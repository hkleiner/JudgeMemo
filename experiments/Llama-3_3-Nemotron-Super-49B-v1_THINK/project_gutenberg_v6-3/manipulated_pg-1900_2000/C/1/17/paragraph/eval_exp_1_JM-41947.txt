Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues related to fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and syntax. However, there are some long, complex sentences that might make reading a bit challenging. For example, the part about the economic crises and the doles system has a sentence that's quite lengthy. Also, some vocabulary like "agog" or "lurid pictures" might be less common, but they're not errors, just possibly less fluent for some readers. I didn't notice any spelling mistakes, so that's good. The main fluency issue is the sentence structure complexity.

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different topics: from Leicester Square to the working class conditions, then to Boucher's biography. The chapters are labeled, which helps, but within chapters, there are abrupt shifts. For instance, in "THE SMALL BEGINNINGS," it starts with Leicester Square, then talks about Reynolds and Goldsmith, shifts to a scene with Mademoiselle Boullenois, and then discusses social conditions in the 19th century. These transitions feel disconnected. The narrative about Boucher's life has clearer progression, but the earlier parts lack smooth connections between ideas. 

Scoring fluency: Mostly fluent but with some minor issues. The complex sentences are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. So maybe a 4.

Coherence: There are noticeable abrupt shifts, especially in the first chapter. The structure isn't consistently logical, but the overall narrative isn't impossible to follow. So a 3.5 perhaps.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., lengthy descriptions of historical economic policies).  
- [LEXICON] Rare archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "agog," "lurid pictures").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt thematic shifts within chapters (e.g., "THE SMALL BEGINNINGS" jumps between biographical, historical, and social commentary).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between ideas (e.g., sudden shifts from Boucherâ€™s biography to broader historical context without smooth bridging).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
