Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned in style, which might affect readability. I notice long, complex sentences that could hinder flow. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence with multiple clauses: "In our judgments...domestication." The structure is grammatically correct but dense. There are also archaic terms like "thou" and phrases that might confuse modern readers. However, I don't see obvious grammatical errors, just stylistic issues. So Fluency might be a 4 because it's mostly fluent but with some minor phrasing issues.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between topics: from animal domestication to historical figures (Louis Quinze), then to the author's history with squirrels, followed by art (Joshua Reynolds), and later to Bahá’u’lláh. These shifts aren't smoothly connected. There's a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs. For instance, the paragraph about Joshua Reynolds seems out of place. The main theme about animal treatment and squirrels is there, but the connections between sections are weak. Coherence would likely be a 3 because while the overall message is somewhat clear, the structure and transitions are poor.

Wait, but some parts do connect, like the squirrel examples and advocacy. However, the inclusion of unrelated topics like 18th-century art and a religious figure disrupts the coherence. So Coherence score 3 makes sense. 

For Fluency Issues, the main problem is [SYNTAX] with overly complex sentences. Maybe [LEXICON] due to outdated vocabulary. For Coherence, [STRUCTURE] and [TRANSITION] issues are key.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with multiple nested clauses. - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and formal tone may impede modern readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., art/history tangents) disrupt thematic flow. - [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between paragraphs.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
