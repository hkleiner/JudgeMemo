Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided scales. The user wants me to follow specific steps: detect problems, summarize them, label the issues, and assign scores without explanations or corrections.

First, I'll tackle Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text provided is quite literary, with complex sentences and old-fashioned vocabulary. I notice some long, convoluted sentences that might affect readability. For example, the first paragraph has multiple clauses stacked together, which could make it hard to follow. Also, there are words like "bewigged," "foppish," and "gadding" that might be less common, potentially causing minor stumbling. However, the text seems mostly error-free in terms of grammar and spelling. The main issue here is the complexity of phrasing and sentence structure, which might earn a Fluency score of 4, as it's mostly fluent but with noticeable minor issues.

Next, Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the narrative flows logically and connects ideas. The text jumps between Fragonard's early life, historical events in France, and artistic influences. There are abrupt transitions, like moving from describing Grasse to discussing the Pompadour's power without clear connections. For instance, the shift from the boy's birth to Boucher's career feels a bit disjointed. Also, some historical details (like the holographic map or livestream mentions) seem out of place in an 18th-century context, causing confusion. These disruptions make the text somewhat hard to follow, but the overall structure is generally understandable. So, Coherence might score a 3 due to noticeable shifts and unclear transitions affecting the reading experience.

I need to ensure I'm using the correct labels. For Fluency, the issues are mainly with Syntax and Lexicon. For Coherence, Structure and Clarity. Avoiding explanations, just bullet points with labels and brief issues. Then assign the scores based on the scales provided.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with multiple nested clauses.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "bewigged," "gadding") and poetic phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biographical and historical context.  
- [CLARITY] Anachronistic terms (e.g., "livestream," "holographic map") disrupt immersion.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
