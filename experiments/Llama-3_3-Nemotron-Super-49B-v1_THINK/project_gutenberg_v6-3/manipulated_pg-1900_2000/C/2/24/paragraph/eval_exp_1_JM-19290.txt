Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the entire text carefully to identify any issues with fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text provided is quite formal and well-structured. Scanning through, I notice that the sentences are complex but mostly clear. However, there are a couple of places where the wording might be a bit awkward. For example, in the Preface, the sentence "Equally inescapable is the collapse of moral and social order..." is a bit abrupt in transition from the previous sentence. Also, some sentences are very long and might cause slight pauses, but they're still understandable. I didn't spot any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes, which is good. So fluency issues are minor, maybe a 4 or 4.5.

Now, coherence: Coherence looks at how well the ideas connect and the overall structure. The text is divided into chapters, each with a clear topic. The flow from the Preface to the life of Bahá’u’lláh seems logical. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For instance, in the "BAHÁ’U’LLÁH" chapter, the paragraph about the millennium and ideological upheavals jumps a bit to discussing Bahá’u’lláh's influence. Also, the inclusion of details like "A keyboard clicked without being touched" and "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A bluetooth signal was detected" seem completely out of place and disrupt the coherence. These random sentences don't connect to the surrounding text and are confusing. That's a major issue. Otherwise, the narrative is mostly clear, but those inserts are jarring. So coherence might score around 3.5 because of those disruptions, despite the overall structure being good.

Wait, but those strange sentences ("keyboard", "hologram", "bluetooth")—are they part of the original text or errors? The user provided the text as is, so I have to evaluate it as given. Those lines are definitely errors or intrusions. They cause abrupt jumps and confusion, affecting coherence significantly. So coherence score would be lower, maybe 3. 

Fluency: Minor issues with sentence structure and transitions, but no errors. Score 4.5.

Coherence: Major issues with those random sentences, otherwise okay. Score 3.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may slightly impede smooth reading flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated phrases ("keyboard", "hologram", "bluetooth") disrupt narrative continuity.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
