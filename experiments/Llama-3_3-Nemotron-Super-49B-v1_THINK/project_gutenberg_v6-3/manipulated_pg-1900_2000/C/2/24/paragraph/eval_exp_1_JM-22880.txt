Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the text for Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is a historical account, so it's formal and detailed. The sentences are mostly long and complex, but they seem well-structured. I notice some archaic terms like "whence" and "avus suus," which might affect readability for modern readers, but they're appropriate for the subject. There's a mix of Latin quotes and historical names, which could make it a bit dense. Checking for grammar or spelling errors... I don't see any obvious ones. The punctuation looks correct, with proper use of commas and periods. Maybe some sentences are a bit too long, causing slight awkwardness, but overall, the language flows smoothly. So Fluency is probably a 4.5, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues from complexity and archaic terms.

Now Coherence. The text is structured chronologically, starting with the etymology of Romsey, then moving through historical events. Each section connects logically to the next. However, there are a lot of names and dates, which might make it hard to follow without prior knowledge. Transitions between paragraphs are clear, but the density of information could cause some confusion. For example, the shift from discussing the abbey's foundation to the architectural details might feel a bit abrupt without clearer transitions. Also, some parts like the list of nuns' names interrupt the narrative flow slightly. Despite that, the overall logic is sound. So Coherence would be a 4, as it's mostly coherent but has some minor disconnects and information overload.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaisms ("whence", "avus suus") and overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialists.  
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences with multiple embedded clauses.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical narrative and architectural details (e.g., shift from Eadgar’s reign to Norman chapel dimensions).  
   - [CLARITY] Overloaded paragraphs with unexplained proper nouns (e.g., "Peter de Langtoft") and minor historical tangents (e.g., nuns’ name statistics).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
