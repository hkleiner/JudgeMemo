Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully to identify any issues related to fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. The text appears to be well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. The sentences flow smoothly, and the vocabulary is appropriate. However, there are a few modern elements inserted like a touchscreen panel, digital assistant, and text-to-speech voice. These anachronisms might disrupt the historical setting, causing slight fluency issues because they feel out of place in a 19th-century narrative. For example, when Mrs. Umney responds and a digital assistant chimes in, it jars the reader. But the rest of the language is fluent, so maybe a minor deduction here.

Now, coherence. The story progresses logically, with each event leading to the next. The introduction of the ghost and the family's reactions are consistent. However, the sudden appearance of modern tech devices (like the touchscreen and digital assistant) might create coherence issues because they don't fit the period. The narrative otherwise holds together well, so the main problem is the inconsistency in setting due to these elements. They cause abrupt shifts in the reader's expectation of the time period, making the story slightly less coherent.

So for fluency, the main issue is the anachronistic terms causing minor disruptions. For coherence, the same elements disrupt the temporal consistency. Both are labeled under [ANACHRONISM] since they're out of place in the historical context.

Scores: Fluency would be high, maybe 4.5 because the language is mostly flawless but for those few terms. Coherence might be 4 since the story flows well except for those inconsistencies.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [ANACHRONISM] Modern terms (e.g., "touchscreen panel," "digital assistant") disrupt historical setting consistency.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [ANACHRONISM] Inclusion of modern technology (e.g., "text-to-speech voice") undermines period-specific narrative coherence.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
