Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text based on Fluency and Coherence using the given scales. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but I notice a few things. There's a mix of old and modern elements, like QR codes, timestamps, and drones mentioned alongside historical events. That might disrupt the flow because it's anachronistic. For example, in Chapter I, a QR code is projected onto a wall in 1901, which is impossible. Similarly, a drone's camera is mentioned in Chapter II. These modern terms in a historical context could be jarring, affecting fluency. 

Also, some sentences are quite long and complex. Like the description of the Bishop Museum or the robe made of birds' feathers. Those might make the text a bit hard to follow, even though they're grammatically correct. There's no obvious grammar or spelling mistakes, but the anachronisms and sentence structure could cause minor issues. So Fluency might be a 4, since it's mostly fluent but has some noticeable distractions.

Now Coherence. The narrative jumps around a bit. The preface talks about the author's experiences, then Chapter I discusses the historical event, followed by a detailed description of Honolulu and its attractions. Then Chapter II moves to Manila. While each part is coherent on its own, the transitions between these sections might feel abrupt. For example, after the historical event, the text suddenly shifts to tourist spots in Honolulu without a clear link. Also, the inclusion of modern elements (QR code, drone, timestamp) breaks the historical coherence. The story seems to meander between different topics (historical significance, travelogue, cultural descriptions) without a strong connecting thread. However, each chapter has its own structure, so it's not completely incoherent. Maybe a Coherence score of 3.5 because there are noticeable transitions issues but the overall narrative holds somewhat.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [ANACHRONISM] Inclusion of modern elements (QR code, drone, timestamp) disrupts historical context.  
- [SENTENCE COMPLEXITY] Occasionally lengthy, convoluted sentences (e.g., descriptions of Bishop Museum, feather robe).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical narrative, travelogue, and cultural descriptions (e.g., Chapter I to Honolulu detour).  
- [LOGIC] Modern technological references (e.g., QR code in 1901) contradict temporal setting.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
