Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the text for fluency and coherence issues. 

Starting with fluency. The text is from H.G. Wells, so it's old-fashioned. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. Checking for grammar, syntax, etc. I notice some archaic terms like "æsthetic" and "mediæval", but those are probably intentional. The structure of sentences is mostly correct, but the length and complexity might make it hard to follow for modern readers. Maybe some commas are missing or misplaced, but overall, the grammar seems okay. So fluency might be a 4 because while it's mostly fluent, the antiquated style and long sentences could cause minor issues.

Now coherence. The text explores two types of minds regarding past and future. The structure is logical, with each paragraph building on the idea. Transitions between ideas seem smooth, like when discussing morality and then moving to public affairs. However, some paragraphs are quite long, which might disrupt flow. Also, the examples (like the promise scenario) help clarify the points but might feel a bit disconnected if not fully integrated. The overall argument is clear, but the density of the text and lack of clear section breaks might make it slightly less coherent. So coherence score could be 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but has some minor disconnects due to length and density.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth readability. - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "æsthetic," "mediæval") and formal tone.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Extended paragraphs without clear subdivisions. - [TRANSITION] Some examples (e.g., promises, wars) feel slightly disconnected from core argument.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
