Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and analyze both fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. The text is historical and formal, which might use complex sentences. I notice some long sentences, like the one describing the river Test's streams. Those could affect readability. Are there any grammatical errors? The example given has "a thing" multiple times, which seems like a placeholder or typo. For instance, "the thing, also surnamed the Unconquered" – "thing" here is probably supposed to be "king" or a name. That's a spelling/error issue. Also, phrases like "the stuff Abbey" clearly have missing words. These are [SPELLING] and [LEXICON] issues because they disrupt understanding.

For coherence, the text jumps between different time periods and names without clear transitions. For example, discussing Eadgar, then switching to Peter de Langtoft's quote without a smooth link. The structure is mostly chronological, but some parts feel abrupt, like the shift from the abbey's destruction to the list of nuns' names. There's also repetition in mentioning the absence of Perpendicular work without fully connecting it to the previous context. These are [TRANSITION] and [STRUCTURE] problems.

Scoring fluency: Despite the formal tone and some complex sentences, the major issues are the repeated errors ("a thing", "the stuff"). These are distracting but the rest of the text is mostly clear. So maybe a 2.5? Because there are frequent errors but not impossible to understand.

Coherence: The overall structure is logical historically, but the abrupt shifts and missing transitions cause confusion. It's generally coherent but with noticeable issues, so a 3.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Repeated placeholder terms ("a thing", "the stuff") indicating missing proper nouns.  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent/unclear word choices (e.g., "thing" instead of titles/names).  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., descriptions of river geography).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical events (e.g., from Eadgar’s church to nuns’ names without connection).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive mentions of architectural styles without clear contextual links.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.0**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **2.5**
