Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues for both Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some awkward phrasings. For example, "the thing" is used repeatedly without explanation, which is confusing. That's a LEXICON issue because of unclear terms. Also, there's a sentence structure problem in "No traveler who lands at the thing will feel unrequited..." which is a bit unclear. SYNTAX might apply here. Some long sentences could be split for better flow, like the one describing the robe's value. That's SYNTAX again. Spelling seems okay, but "lemon" is mentioned as "lemons" in one place—wait, no, "belated boxes of lemons" is correct. Maybe "stuff" is a typo or placeholder, but it's used multiple times. That's definitely LEXICON. Also, "the stuff of a thing" is very vague. 

For Coherence, the structure is generally logical, but there are abrupt transitions. Like moving from the ship's departure to describing Honolulu attractions without a clear link. That's TRANSITION. The part about the naval lieutenant and Napoleon seems out of place in the context of the ship's journey. LOGIC issue there. Also, in Chapter II, the description of Manila starts well but jumps between different elements like the bridge scene and the notice about supplies without smooth connections. STRUCTURE problem. Some parts, like the detail about the robe's cost, might be too detailed and disrupt the flow, affecting CLARITY.

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent but with several minor issues. Maybe a 4? But the repeated "thing" and some awkward sentences might bring it down to 3.5.

Coherence: The overall structure is there, but some sections feel disconnected. Transitions could be better. Maybe a 3.5 as well, since while it's generally readable, the jumps are noticeable.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of undefined term "the thing" causing confusion.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., "No traveler who lands at the thing...").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence constructions (e.g., description of robe’s value).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from ship departure to Honolulu attractions.  
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur reference to Napoleon and naval lieutenant.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed scene transitions (e.g., Manila bridge description to supply notice).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
