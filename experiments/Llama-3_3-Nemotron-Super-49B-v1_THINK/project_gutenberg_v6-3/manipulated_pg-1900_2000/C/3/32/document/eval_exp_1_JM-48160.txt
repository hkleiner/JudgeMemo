Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to spot any fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written with good grammar and syntax. However, there are a few points where the phrasing feels a bit awkward. For example, the repeated use of "the thing" to refer to the government or military administration is odd and might confuse readers. Also, some sentences are quite long and complex, which could interrupt the flow. I didn't notice any spelling errors, but there's inconsistent terminology, like "oeuvre" and "stuff," which might be distracting.

Now for Coherence. The narrative jumps around a bit. The author starts talking about the war zone, then shifts to societal classes, and later to the process of getting permits. While the connections are generally there, the transitions between topics could be smoother. There's some repetition, like mentioning the difficulty of meeting bourgeoisie members and the embassy's ineffectiveness, which might make the text feel a bit disjointed. The structure is mostly logical, but some parts, like the list of places visited, could be integrated more seamlessly.

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly fluent, but the awkward terms and long sentences deduct a point. So maybe a 4?

Coherence: The story is coherent overall, but the jumps and repetitions bring it down to a 4 as well. Wait, but the criteria say Score 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The issues here are noticeable but don't disrupt much. So maybe 4 for both?

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Inconsistent and unclear terminology ("the thing", "oeuvre", "stuff"). - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex or awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have spent a good part of my life in the thing").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between societal commentary and war zone narrative. - [STRUCTURE] Repetitive mentions of bureaucratic hurdles without clear progression.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
