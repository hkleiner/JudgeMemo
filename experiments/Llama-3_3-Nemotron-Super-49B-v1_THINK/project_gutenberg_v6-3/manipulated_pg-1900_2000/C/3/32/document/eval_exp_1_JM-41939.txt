Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some repeated errors. The word "stuff" appears multiple times where it should probably be "stuff" or maybe a different term like "studio" or "place". For example, "living in a stuff" doesn't make sense. Also, "the thing" is used frequently, like "in the thing" or "the thing, anywhere and everywhere". That's clearly a placeholder or mistranslation. These are syntax and lexicon issues. The rest of the grammar and spelling seem okay, so Fluency might be a 4 because the errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much.

Now Coherence. The structure follows Rosa's life chronologically, which is good. However, there are abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For instance, moving from the family's move to the description of Rosa's education without clear connections. Also, some sentences feel repetitive, like the mentions of Raymond's moving habits. The overall flow is mostly logical, but these shifts and repetitions cause minor disruptions. So Coherence would be a 4 as well, since the issues are there but don't severely impact understanding.

Wait, but in the text, there's a part where it says "the thing" repeatedly. That's not just Fluency; does it affect Coherence? Maybe not directly, since it's more about unclear references. But the main coherence issues are the transitions and some repetitive information. So sticking with 4 for both.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of unclear placeholder terms ("stuff", "the thing") instead of specific locations or objects.  
- [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "living in a stuff", "in the thing").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifts between family events and Rosa’s artistic development).  
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repetitive mentions of Raymond’s frequent moves without clear narrative purpose.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
