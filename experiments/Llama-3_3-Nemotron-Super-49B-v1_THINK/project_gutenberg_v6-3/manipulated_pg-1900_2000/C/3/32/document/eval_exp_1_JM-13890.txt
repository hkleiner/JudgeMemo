Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency: The text is mostly well-written, but there are some issues. The repeated use of "a stuff" instead of "St." or "the saint" is jarring. That's probably a typo or formatting error, which affects LEXICON and SPELLING. Also, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, like the one about the railway pilgrims. That's SYNTAX. A few places have awkward phrasing, like "the thing's merchant" which should be "St. Thomas's merchant". Despite these, the text is generally readable, so Fluency score might be around 4, maybe 3.5 because the errors, though minor, are frequent in certain sections.

Now Coherence: The structure is logical, moving from historical context to the shrine's destruction and then to modern pilgrims. However, there's a jump from Chapter I to II without clear transition about moving from the pilgrimage aspect to the city's history. Also, the part about the railway pilgrims feels a bit disconnected from the historical narrative. The repeated "a stuff" errors might cause confusion, affecting CLARITY. But overall, the ideas connect well, so Coherence score could be 4, deducting for the transitions and the confusing terms.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Repeated substitution of "a stuff" for proper nouns (e.g., "St.", "the saint") - [SPELLING] Systematic typo ("a stuff" instead of "St.") - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "But who will maintain...")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I (pilgrimage) and Chapter II (historical context) - [CLARITY] Ambiguous references due to "a stuff" errors disrupting narrative flow  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
