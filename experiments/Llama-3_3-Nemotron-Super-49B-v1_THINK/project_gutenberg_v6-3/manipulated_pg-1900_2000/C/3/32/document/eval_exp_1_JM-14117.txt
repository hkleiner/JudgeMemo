Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues in fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is from an older time, probably early 20th century, given the language and topics. The writing style is formal and somewhat archaic. I notice long, complex sentences which might affect readability. For example, the first chapter has sentences with multiple clauses. While the grammar seems mostly correct, the phrasing is old-fashioned and might cause some stumbling for modern readers. There are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors, but the vocabulary is somewhat antiquated (e.g., "gargantuan strides" might be less common now). The structure of sentences is mostly logical, but the length and complexity could make fluency a 4. Maybe minor deductions for phrasing that's a bit awkward today.

Now coherence. The text is well-structured with clear chapters addressing different aspects of the problem. Each part logically follows the previous, discussing causes, difficulties, and comparisons. Transitions between ideas are smooth. However, some paragraphs are quite long without clear subsections, which might make following the argument slightly harder. The author's points are consistent, arguing for applying business principles to housework. There's no apparent contradiction or abrupt shifts. The only issue might be the density of information in long paragraphs, but overall coherence is strong. Maybe a score of 5 here, but need to check if the structure within chapters is perfectly logical. Since the text is divided into clear chapters and each supports the main thesis without gaps, coherence is excellent. 

Wait, in the coherence scale, a 5 requires "a clear and logical progression throughout" with minor lapses not hindering understanding. The text does that. So coherence score 5. Fluency, despite formal language and long sentences, is mostly fluent but not perfectly natural for modern readers, so maybe 4.5? But let me check the criteria again. 

Fluency scale: 5 is highly fluent with minimal errors. This text has no errors but archaic phrasing. Since the errors are minimal (none actually), but phrasing is somewhat unnatural now, maybe 4.5 is appropriate. Or does the archaic style count as a fluency issue? The definition includes "natural phrasing." If the phrasing, while correct, is not natural to contemporary standards, that could deduct. But the scale says "minor issues... do not distract." If the archaic style doesn't distract much, maybe 4.5. Alternatively, if it's considered a stylistic choice rather than an error, maybe 5. But given the task is about how it reads now, I think 4.5 is better. 

For coherence, no issues detected, so 5. 

Issues for fluency: [SYNTAX] Complex, archaic sentence structures; [LEXICON] Outdated vocabulary. 

Coherence issues: None, so leave blank.
