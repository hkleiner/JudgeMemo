Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues related to fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is quite formal and uses complex vocabulary, which is appropriate for an academic or art historical discussion. However, there are some archaic terms like "mediæval" and "thirteenth century MS" which might cause minor pauses for some readers, but they're contextually correct. I notice some repeated phrases like "the thing" which seems like a placeholder or an error. For example, "the two neighbouring cities of the thing and Augsburg" – "thing" doesn't make sense here; maybe it's a typo or missing word. That's a clarity issue under LEXICON perhaps. Also, long sentences might affect readability. The sentence structures are mostly clear, but some are very long and convoluted, like the one describing the initial 'S' in De Claris Mulieribus. That could be a SYNTAX issue. 

For coherence, the text jumps between different books and printers without clear transitions. For example, moving from discussing Ulm and Augsburg to specific printers like Gunther Zainer without a smooth link. There's also repetition in mentioning the quality of borders and initials across different sections. The structure seems a bit disjointed, with topics like the artistic value of the books introduced later without a clear connection to the preceding paragraphs. Maybe a STRUCTURE or TRANSITION issue. 

Now, scoring. For fluency, despite some complex sentences and the "thing" errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much, so maybe a 4. For coherence, the disjointedness and lack of clear transitions are more significant. The text is generally understandable but has noticeable issues, so a 3.5 perhaps.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent/incomplete terminology ("the thing" used repeatedly without clarification).  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., descriptions of decorative elements).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and disjointed discussion of printers/books without clear transitional links.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between evaluating artistic merit and listing examples (e.g., shift to defending "works of art" claim).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
