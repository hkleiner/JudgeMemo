Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text based on Fluency and Coherence using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite long, divided into chapters. The language seems formal and descriptive, which is appropriate for a biographical or historical piece. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice some archaic language like "whilst," "thou," and "thee," but that might be intentional for the period setting. Are there any actual errors? For example, "the artist shoulded work over it" â€“ "shoulded" isn't correct; it should be "was required to work over it." Also, "he was was made to paint" has a double "was." These are grammatical errors. 

Syntax-wise, some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the paragraph starting "The Pompadour had gathered about her..." has multiple clauses stacked up. That affects readability. Word choice is mostly good, but "vogues" might be less common, though not incorrect. Punctuation seems okay, but long sentences might benefit from commas for clarity.

Now Coherence. The text follows Fragonard's life chronologically, so structure is logical. However, there are abrupt shifts between his life events and historical context. For instance, detailed descriptions of the Pompadour's influence interrupt the narrative flow. Transitions between chapters could be smoother. Some parts feel like info dumps, like the extensive history of the French monarchy, which might not be tightly integrated with Fragonard's story. Also, the tone sometimes shifts from biographical to analytical or philosophical, like the ending paragraphs discussing the art movement's significance. That might disrupt coherence for some readers.

Scoring Fluency: Despite some errors and complex sentences, the text is mostly readable. The errors are minor but present. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has noticeable issues.

Coherence: The structure is generally clear, but the transitions and some tangents reduce coherence. Maybe a 3.5? It's coherent overall but with notable disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "shoulded") and redundant words (e.g., "he was was made").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, unwieldy sentence structures impairing readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between biographical narrative and historical tangents (e.g., lengthy royal politics descriptions).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between chapters and thematic shifts (e.g., art analysis vs. personal life).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
