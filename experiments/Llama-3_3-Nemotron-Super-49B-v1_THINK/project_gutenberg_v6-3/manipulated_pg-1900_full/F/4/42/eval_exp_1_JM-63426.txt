Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is Will Bradley's autobiography, which is quite lengthy. I need to assess Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is written in an older style, from the early 20th century, so some phrasing might seem archaic but not necessarily incorrect. I need to check for errors. Scanning through, I notice some archaic terms and sentence structures, but no obvious grammatical errors. For example, "was" used instead of "were" in a few places, like "Mr. Leonard was passing." That's a subject-verb agreement error. Also, "you was seated" should be "you were seated." These are minor but present. The text is mostly clear, so Fluency score might be 4, considering minor issues but overall readability.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the overall structure, logical flow, transitions, and whether ideas connect. The autobiography is structured chronologically with chapters, which helps. However, some chapters jump between topics without clear transitions. For instance, moving from his time in Chicago to the Gay Nineties chapter might feel a bit abrupt. Also, there are long, detailed descriptions that might disrupt the flow for some readers. But overall, the narrative is mostly logical and easy to follow. So Coherence score could be 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but generally well-organized.

Wait, let me double-check. For Fluency, those "was" errors are definite points. Maybe Fluency is 4 because they're minor but present. Coherence: the structure is clear, but some sections are verbose or have abrupt shifts. Maybe Coherence is also 4. Alternatively, if the coherence issues are more noticeable, maybe 3.5. But given the chapters are labeled and the overall timeline is clear, I think 4 for both.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "you was seated," "Mr. Leonard was passing")  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional archaic phrasing (e.g., "was going to was done")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between some chapters (e.g., Chicago to "Gay Nineties")  
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed, verbose descriptions in later sections  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
