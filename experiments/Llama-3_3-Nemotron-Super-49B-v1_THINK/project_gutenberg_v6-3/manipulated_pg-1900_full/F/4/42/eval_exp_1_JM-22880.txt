Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria and outputting a particular format.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a historical account of Romsey Abbey, structured into chapters. The language seems formal and detailed, with historical references and architectural descriptions.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some issues. I noticed a few grammatical errors, like "woulded" which should be "would have". Also, there are long, complex sentences that might make reading a bit difficult. For example, the sentence about Eadgar's church and the Norman form is a bit convoluted. There's also inconsistent verb tense usage in some places, like switching between past and past perfect without clear reason. Spelling seems okay, but "Romesy" in the title might be a typo (should be Romsey). The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but some sentences are overly long and could be broken up for better flow.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas are connected and the overall structure. The text is generally well-structured with chapters, but there are abrupt transitions. For instance, moving from architectural details to the story of Eadgar and Ã†lfthryth feels a bit disconnected. There's also some repetition, like mentioning the Norman apsidal east end multiple times without clear progression. The historical events could be more clearly sequenced, and some sections feel like lists (e.g., the list of abbesses) that disrupt the narrative flow. However, the use of transitional phrases is generally good, maintaining some coherence despite the complexity.

For Fluency score: The text has some errors but is mostly readable. The errors are minor but noticeable. So maybe a 4? But the long sentences and a few grammatical mistakes might bring it down to 3.5.

For Coherence score: The structure is mostly logical, but there are jumps and some lack of clear connections between sections. Maybe a 3.5 as well, since while it's generally coherent, there are notable disruptions.

Wait, checking the criteria again. Fluency 4 is "mostly fluent... minor issues". The errors here are minor but present, so 4 might be right. Coherence 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues". The transitions and some disjointed parts justify a 3.5 maybe. But the criteria say 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable abrupt shifts". Given the transitions and some repetition, maybe 3.5 is better. But I need to decide based on the most serious problems.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent, minor issues), Coherence 3.5 (some noticeable issues but overall coherent).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Sporadic grammatical errors (e.g., "woulded," inconsistent tense usage).  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures reducing clarity.  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "Romesy" in title).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical and architectural descriptions.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some chapters/sections (e.g., legends vs. architectural details).  
- [REPEAT] Repetitive explanations of architectural features without clear progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
