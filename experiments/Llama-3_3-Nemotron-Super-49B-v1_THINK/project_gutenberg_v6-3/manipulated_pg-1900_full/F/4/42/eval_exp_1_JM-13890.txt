Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long and detailed, historical in nature. I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "who woulded ever wend his way" should be "who would ever wend his way." There's also "had had been entirely abandoned" which is a bit redundant. Then, "the gate on account of the difficulty of getting his procession through the low arch" uses "his" incorrectly; it should be "their." 

There are also some awkward phrasings. Like "the most marvellous good fortune" is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. "Had come down to the present time almost unharmed" might be better as "had survived almost unharmed." Also, "the colour is all subserviented" should be "the color is subordinate." These are minor but noticeable.

For coherence, the text is well-structured with clear chapters, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, moving from the history of Canterbury to the description of the Cathedral's architecture without a clear link. Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. Like the part about Henry II's penance and the rebuilding of the choir. The text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about historical figures and events, which might confuse some readers.

Now, labeling the issues. For fluency, the main labels would be GRAMMAR and LEXICON for word choice. For coherence, TRANSITION and STRUCTURE. 

Scoring: Fluency has some errors but overall readable. Maybe a 4? Coherence is mostly good but with some transitions and complexity, so maybe 4 as well. Wait, but the fluency errors are scattered. Let me check the scale. Score 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." The errors here are minor but present, so 4.0. Coherence is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," so 4.0 as well. But wait, the transitions between historical periods could be smoother. Maybe 3.5 for coherence? No, the structure is generally clear, just some long sentences. I think 4.0 for both.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- **[GRAMMAR]** Irregular verb forms (e.g., "woulded," "had had been") and minor punctuation lapses.  
- **[LEXICON]** Archaic or overly formal phrasing (e.g., "subserviented," "marvellous good fortune").  
- **[SYNTAX]** Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., long compound sentences).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- **[TRANSITION]** Abrupt shifts between historical eras or descriptive focuses (e.g., architectural details to pilgrim routes).  
- **[STRUCTURE]** Assumed prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., unexplained figures like "Dean Stanley").  
- **[CLARITY]** Overly dense paragraphs with layered historical layers.  

3) **FINAL Coherence Score**: **4.0**  
4) **FINAL Fluency Score**: **4.0**
