Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the text, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "So, let us started our story..." should be "let's start". There's also "many migrations over a long period of time were made by various small groups of peoples." The correct term is "peoples" might be okay in some contexts, but usually, it's "people". Then, "we do not knew" should be "we do not know". Also, "Some people was of the assumption" should be "were". These are clear grammar issues.

Looking at spelling, I didn't spot any obvious typos, so maybe that's okay. Syntax-wise, some sentences are a bit awkward. For example, "The method of projection for the point mentioned likely was done either via a lance or the atlatl (spearthrower and dart)." The phrasing could be smoother, but it's understandable. 

For coherence, the structure seems mostly logical, but there are abrupt transitions. For instance, moving from discussing Basketmakers to Apaches without clear links. Also, some paragraphs are quite long and dense, making it hard to follow. The text jumps between different groups and time periods without strong transitions. 

In the coherence issues, the main problems are abrupt shifts between topics, like from Basketmakers to Apaches, and unclear transitions. The text could benefit from clearer connections between chapters. Also, some parts feel repetitive, like the discussion of midden circles in different chapters. 

Scoring fluency: There are multiple grammatical errors but the text is generally readable. So maybe a 3.5? Because it's mostly fluent but has noticeable issues.

Coherence: The structure is there, but transitions are weak and some sections feel disconnected. Maybe a 3 because it's generally coherent but has significant flaws.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "So, let us started our story", "some people was of the assumption", "we do not knew").
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect tense consistency (e.g., "would attempted").
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "The method of projection for the point mentioned likely was done").
- [LEXICON] Repetitive vocabulary (e.g., "it is very logical to assume" repeated).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical groups (e.g., Basketmakers to Apaches without clear links).
- [STRUCTURE] Overly dense paragraphs with disjointed subtopics (e.g., midden circles explained in multiple chapters).
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "this last happen" unclear in context).
- [LOGIC] Speculative claims presented without clear evidence (e.g., "pure supposition" about Basketmakersâ€™ fate).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
