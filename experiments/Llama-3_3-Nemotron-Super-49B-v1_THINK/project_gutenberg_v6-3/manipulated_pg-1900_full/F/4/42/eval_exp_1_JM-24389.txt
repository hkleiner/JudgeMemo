Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as defined. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite lengthy, and from the sample, it seems to be a literary piece, possibly early 20th century given the style. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. 

Looking through the text, I notice some archaic language and punctuation, like "to-morrow" instead of "tomorrow", or "you was" which should be "you were". There are also some long, complex sentences that might disrupt flow. For example, the sentence starting "For half an hour they compared and checked off items..." has a few clauses that make it a bit hard to follow. Also, there are instances where the tense shifts, like "I sent the shells... Did they arrive?" which jumps from past to present. 

Spelling seems okay, but there are typos like "come" instead of "came" in "as she come down the steps". Syntax-wise, some sentences are structured in a way that's less common now, which might cause minor pauses. Word choice is mostly good, but terms like "blue-bird weather" require explanation, though it's defined later.

Now, Coherence. The story seems to follow a logical sequence: Marche arrives, interacts with the family, develops feelings, and the plot unfolds with Herold's backstory. However, there are abrupt transitions, like jumping from the shooting scene to Marche thinking about Herold's past without clear connectors. Some sections feel repetitive, such as the detailed descriptions of nature that, while vivid, might slow the pace. The character motivations, especially Herold's sudden appearance and backstory, might feel a bit forced or info-dumpy. 

Also, the shift from Marche's romantic development to Herold's embezzlement history feels somewhat disconnected without prior hints. The themes of social class and redemption are there but could be more seamlessly integrated.

Scoring Fluency: Despite some errors and archaic style, the text is generally readable. The issues are minor but frequent, so maybe a 4? 

Coherence: The overall structure is logical, but there are noticeable jumps and some heavy-handed info dumps. Maybe a 3.5?

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Archaic verb conjugations (e.g., "you was") and inconsistent tense shifts.  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "come" instead of "came").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., romantic subplot to Herold’s backstory).  
- [PACING] Overly detailed nature descriptions disrupt narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Herold’s embezzlement revelation feels forced and unforeshadowed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
