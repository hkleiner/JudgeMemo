Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria and outputting scores with bullet points for the most serious issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite lengthy and written in an old style, which might affect readability. I notice some archaic language and long sentences. For example, sentences like "Time has dealt kindly with the reputation of the old stage coachman..." are a bit convoluted. Also, there are quotes and passages from old sources (like Nimrod's essay) which might disrupt the flow for modern readers. Are there any grammatical errors? Scanning through, I see "he was very frequently a faithful servant to his employers" – that's correct. Wait, there's a part where it says "the spirit of his cattle was broken by the task they were called to perform--for in those days twenty-mile stages were in fashion". The em dash usage is correct, but the sentence structure is complex. Another spot: "what was the consequence? Why, the four-horse whip..." – the transition here feels abrupt. Also, in the part about the coachman's skills, the sentence "He could untie a knot with his teeth and tie another with his tongue, as well as he could with his hands" uses "as well as he could with his hands" which is a bit awkward but grammatically okay. 

Looking for syntax issues. The text uses complex sentences with multiple clauses, which might make it hard to follow. For example, the long narrative about the old gentleman's journey has many embedded descriptions and dialogue, which could cause fluency issues. There's also a mix of historical accounts, anecdotes, and descriptive passages, which might not transition smoothly. 

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between different topics: historical coaching innovations, descriptions of coachmen, accidents, racing, and then modern coaching. The structure seems a bit disjointed. For instance, after discussing 19th-century coaching, it jumps to the 20th century with James Selby's drive without a clear connection. The Nimrod essay is a long excerpt that might feel like a break in the narrative flow. There are also sections like the song at the end, which seems unrelated to the rest of the historical discussion. The transitions between these sections could be better. The author assumes a lot of background knowledge about coaching history, which might confuse readers not familiar with the terms and events mentioned.

For Fluency score: Despite some complexity and archaic style, the text is mostly readable. The errors are minimal, mainly in phrasing and sentence length. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has noticeable issues.

Coherence score: The text has several abrupt shifts and lacks a clear overall structure. The topics are loosely connected, and the song feels out of place. So maybe a 3, as it's generally coherent but with significant disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences with multiple embedded clauses (e.g., Nimrod’s essay passages).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "unrivalled skill," "bo-kickers," "gammon board") may hinder modern readability.  
- [STRUCTURE] Frequent shifts between narrative, historical quotes, and poetic excerpts disrupt flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between 19th-century coaching, modern analogies (e.g., James Selby), and unrelated elements (e.g., "Song of the B.D.C.").  
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear thematic progression or logical connectors between historical anecdotes and contemporary references.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes specialized knowledge of coaching terminology and historical context without explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
