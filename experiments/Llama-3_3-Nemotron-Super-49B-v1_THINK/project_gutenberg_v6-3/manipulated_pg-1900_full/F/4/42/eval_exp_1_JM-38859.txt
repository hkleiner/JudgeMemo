Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the given Civil War text based on fluency and coherence, then output the scores in a specific format.

First, I need to recall the definitions. Fluency is about how smoothly the text readsâ€”grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Coherence is about the structure and logical flow of the entire text.

Looking at the text, it's a personal account from a soldier. The structure is chronological, which is good for coherence. But it's quite long and detailed. The author jumps between different events without strong transitions. For example, after describing a battle, they suddenly talk about trading coffee for tobacco. That might disrupt coherence.

For fluency, the text uses mostly correct grammar and spelling, but there are some old-fashioned terms or possible typos, like "Rosecrans placed his army around Chattanooga and expected Bragg woulded continue the battle". "Woulded" is incorrect; it should be "would". Also, sentence structure is sometimes long and convoluted, which affects readability.

Coherence issues: The narrative shifts between military actions, personal anecdotes, and even a clipping from a newspaper. The transition between these sections isn't smooth. The part where they insert the Blandinsville Star article feels like an abrupt addition without clear connection to the rest.

Fluency deductions: The main issues are occasional grammatical errors (like "woulded"), some awkward phrasing, and outdated vocabulary that might confuse modern readers. However, overall, it's readable.

Coherence deductions: Lack of clear transitions between sections, inclusion of unrelated content (the newspaper clip), and a very detailed but sometimes disjointed recounting of events.

Scores: Fluency might be a 4 because despite some errors, it's mostly fluent. Coherence might be a 3.5 due to the structure issues and abrupt transitions, but the overall chronological order saves it from being lower.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (incorrect verb form, should be "would")  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., overly long narratives)  
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms (e.g., "Yanks," "Johnnies," "coons") may confuse modern readers  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt inclusion of the *Blandinsville Star* article without contextual integration  
- [TRANSITION] Weak connections between personal anecdotes (e.g., coffee-trading) and broader military events  
- [CLARITY] Excessive, unorganized detail (e.g., repetitive battle summaries)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
