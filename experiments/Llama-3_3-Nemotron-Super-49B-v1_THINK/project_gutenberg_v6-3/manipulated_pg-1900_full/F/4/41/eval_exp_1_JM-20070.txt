Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and identify issues for both fluency and coherence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the text, I notice several typos. For example, "hwnds" instead of "hands", "tearfuly" missing an 'l' maybe? Wait, "tearfully" is correct, but in the text it's written as "tearfuly"—that's a typo. Also, "abt" should be "about", "tegs" instead of "legs", "wll" for "will", "sebselessly" instead of "senselessly", "trum" maybe "trim" lawn, "yiung" for "young", "sombas" instead of "so as not to", "ovrr" for "over", "mjrjorie" with a typo, "zuffered" instead of "suffered", "dp" for "do", "teh" for "the", "wjd" for "would", "tegs" again, "znd" for "and", "cn't" missing apostrophe, "teh" again, "tegs" once more. These are all spelling errors.

Then there's punctuation. Some places might have missing or incorrect punctuation, but the text mostly uses periods and commas correctly. However, there are instances like "It's a long, long time, four days," which is correct, but maybe some run-on sentences. For example, in Chapter V, the dialogue and narrative blend without clear separation at times, which could affect readability.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure. The story seems to follow a narrative: the reunion, wedding, and departure. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, moving from the wedding to the honeymoon train scene without a clear bridge. Also, in Chapter III, the shift from the beach scene to Leonard's war story feels a bit sudden. The character of the hunchback in Chapter V appears out of nowhere and his lines might disrupt the flow for some readers.

Additionally, some sections have repetitive ideas or emotions expressed in similar ways, like Marjorie's internal monologues about fear and love, which, while emotional, might feel repetitive.

For Fluency score: Multiple typos and minor grammatical issues, but the text is mostly readable. So maybe a 3.5? Because while there are errors, they don't completely hinder understanding.

For Coherence score: The overall structure is there, but some transitions are weak and there's a character introduced abruptly. Maybe a 3 as well, since it's generally coherent but with noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "hwnds", "tearfuly", "wll", "sebselessly", "trum", "yiung", "sombas", "ovrr", "zuffered", "dp", "teh", "wjd", "cn't")  
   - [SYNTAX] Occasional run-on sentences or unclear sentence structure  
   - [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., wedding to honeymoon train)  
   - [CLARITY] Repetitive emotional expressions (e.g., Marjorie’s fear, Leonard’s trauma)  
   - [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of minor characters (e.g., hunchback in Chapter V)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
