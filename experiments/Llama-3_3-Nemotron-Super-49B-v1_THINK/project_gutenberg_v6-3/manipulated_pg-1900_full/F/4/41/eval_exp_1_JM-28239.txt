Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the specified scales. The text is quite long, so I need to read through it carefully but efficiently.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the text, I notice some typos like "thirs" instead of "thirds", "lrrng" instead of "long", "unvaribly" instead of "invariably", "Englkshman" should be "Englishman", "rmtained" instead of "remained", "rmmained" again, "corty" instead of "could", "bebdn" instead of "been", "ts" instead of "its", "qhich" instead of "which", "tefms" instead of "terms", "cpnstituents" instead of "constituents", "wnd" instead of "and" multiple times, "tsx" instead of "tax", "asbto" instead of "as to", "absorbkng" instead of "absorbing", "fhat" instead of "that", "yhe" instead of "the", "mnm" instead of "man", "teh" instead of "the", "fhat" again, "ytimes" instead of "times", "teh" again, "fhat" once more. These are clear spelling mistakes. 

Also, there are grammatical issues like "lured bt the possibility" (should be "by"), "hemsecured" (should be "he secured"), "a young man twenty-two years of age came to Canada from the Old World" – maybe a comma needed for clarity. Some sentences are a bit long or awkwardly structured, like the description of Boone's hunting routine. However, overall, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much. So Fluency score might be around 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and connections between ideas. The text is divided into chapters, each covering a different aspect of Kentucky's history. The structure seems logical, moving from geography to early visitors, pioneers, settlements, etc. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For example, in the chapter about Boone, it jumps from his activities to the story about the women fetching water without a clear link. Also, some sections feel a bit repetitive or include details that don't strongly contribute to the main narrative, like the specific story about General Taylor and Davis, which, while interesting, might not be essential. The text also mixes historical events without always signaling the timeline clearly. For instance, the transition from the Revolutionary War to the War of 1812 isn't smoothly connected. Despite this, the overall narrative is understandable, and the chapters are themed. So Coherence might be a 3.5, as there are noticeable issues but the text remains generally coherent.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "thirs", "lrrng", "Englkshman", "unvaribly", "corty", "ts", "qhich", "wnd", "tsx", "asbto", "absorbkng", "fhat", "yhe", "mnm", "teh").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical errors (e.g., "lured bt", "hemsecured", missing commas).  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., long descriptions).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between paragraphs (e.g., Boone’s story to women fetching water).  
- [STRUCTURE] Some tangential details (e.g., Taylor-Davis reconciliation) disrupt focus.  
- [LOGIC] Timeline connections between historical events (e.g., War of 1812, Mexican War) could be clearer.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
