Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues for both Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency: The text is quite long, so I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon issues. Scanning through, I notice some typos like "expecrancy" (should be "expectancy"), "fhe" (the), "thw" (the), "morn." repeated with inconsistent capitalization. There are also awkward phrasings, like "the duscoveries of science" (discoveries), "tne" (the), "dl" (do), "inbijg" (inching), "nw" (now), "teh" (the), "ot" (of), "unhappinesses" (unhappiness). These are clear typos and minor errors. The sentence structure is mostly complex but generally clear, though some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might affect readability. 

For Coherence: The text has multiple chapters, each addressing a theme related to Christmas and goodwill. The overall structure seems logical, moving from describing the past vs. present Christmas experience, to analyzing the reasons for decline, discussing the importance of goodwill, and ending with personal cultivation of goodwill and reflections on happiness. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs, especially in chapters like SIX and SEVEN, where the author jumps from discussing festivals to personal methods without smooth connections. Some ideas feel repetitive, like the emphasis on children's faith and the importance of imagination in goodwill, which might make the text a bit disjointed. Also, the tone shifts from philosophical to somewhat sarcastic (e.g., the part about the superior sceptic), which could disrupt coherence.

Now, scoring Fluency: Despite the numerous typos and minor errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are frequent but not overwhelming. The phrasing is generally natural, though some sentences are awkward. This would place it around a 3 or 3.5. Considering the scale, a 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues." Given the number of typos, maybe 3 is more accurate.

For Coherence: The structure is mostly logical, but there are noticeable transitions issues and some repetition. The ideas connect overall, but not seamlessly. The scale says a 3 is "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts... that affect the reading experience." That fits, so Coherence score is 3.

Finalizing the bullet points: For Fluency, list the typos with labels like [SPELLING], [SYNTAX] for awkward structures. For Coherence, note abrupt transitions and repetition with [TRANSITION], [STRUCTURE].

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "expecrancy", "fhe", "thw", "inbijg", "nw", "teh", "ot", "unhappinesses").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the duscoveries of science", "dl we need").  
- [LEXICON] Rare archaic/vague terms (e.g., "vastnesses", "unhappinesses").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between paragraphs (e.g., Chapter SIX to SEVEN).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on goodwill/imagination without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences (e.g., Chapter SEVENâ€™s method description).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
