Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate a given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria and a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points allowed. The output needs to be in a very specific format without any explanations.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. The text appears to be a biography of Fran√ßois Boucher, structured in chapters. The language is quite formal and ornate, possibly from an older publication or written in a stylistic manner reminiscent of 18th-century literature.

For Fluency, I need to check grammar, spelling, syntax, lexis, and overall flow. Let me scan the text for any errors. I notice some typos like "jnked" (inked), "knlwing" (knowing), "bkrn" (born), "thd" (the), "tne" (the), "wkth" (with), "furst" (first), "teh" (the), "accomplishmnent" (accomplishment), "hrsitances" (hesitances), "rrsted" (rested), "teh" (the), "crrtain" (certain), "fdagrance" (fragrance), "joloy" (jolly), "anr" (and), "wbich" (which), "tk" (to), "unserpassed" (unpassed?), "teh" (the), "fodtieth" (fortieth), "thd" (the), "tjme" (time), "tgat" (that), "qas" (was), "tgat" (that). These are clear spelling mistakes. Also, some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect fluency. For example, the first paragraph in "THE SMALL BEGINNINGS" is a single long sentence with multiple clauses. That could make reading a bit challenging, but the structure, while archaic, is mostly correct. However, the numerous typos would deduct points.

For Coherence, I need to check logical flow, structure, clarity, transitions. The text is divided into chapters with clear topics (birth, student years, etc.), so the structure is logical. However, there are abrupt shifts when historical events are interjected without clear transitions. For example, moving from Boucher's personal life to detailed descriptions of wars and political events might disrupt the flow for some readers. Also, some paragraphs jump between different time periods or topics without smooth connections. The text assumes a lot of historical knowledge (e.g., Louis XIV, the Pompadour) without explanation, which could confuse readers not familiar with the context. Despite this, the overall narrative follows Boucher's life chronologically, so coherence is generally maintained but with some lapses.

Now, scoring. For Fluency: Despite the elaborate style, the text is mostly readable. The typos are numerous but not everywhere. The long sentences and some awkward phrasing (due to style or errors) exist, but the text doesn't become unintelligible. So maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally fluent but with noticeable issues.

For Coherence: The structure is mostly logical, but there are transitions that could be smoother, and some tangents (historical events) that might confuse. However, the overall story is easy to follow. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Wait, but the historical context assumptions might be a bigger issue. If the reader isn't familiar with the time period, some parts might be confusing. But the text does provide some context, like explaining who the Pompadour is. Hmm. Maybe Coherence is a 3.5 because while the structure is there, the transitions and assumptions could cause some disruption.

But let me check the criteria again. Coherence score 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," which fits. Fluency score 3.5 because "generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues."

Wait, the Fluency scale says 3 is "generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow." The typos here are multiple, but are they grammatical/structural? Some are spelling errors (like "bkrn"), others are typos in words (e.g., "thd" for "the"). These are more spelling errors than grammatical, but they do interrupt flow. So maybe Fluency is 3.5 because while the text is readable, the errors are frequent enough to be distracting.

Alternatively, if the errors are mostly minor typos rather than grammatical, maybe it's still a 4 for Fluency? Wait, the Fluency definition includes spelling as a factor. So numerous spelling errors would affect the score. The example for score 4 says "minor issues in grammar or phrasing" that are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. Here, the spelling errors are more than minor and do cause some disruption, so maybe 3.5 is right.

Coherence: The historical tangents and lack of transitions in some places make it a 3.5? Or 4? Since the overall structure is clear, but some parts are disconnected. The criteria for 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts." That seems to fit. So Coherence 4, Fluency 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "jnked", "bkrn", "thd") disrupting readability. - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex, archaic sentence structures.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biographical and historical contexts. - [CLARITY] Assumes historical knowledge without full explanation.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
