Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is a historical account of Romsey Abbey, structured into chapters. First, I need to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly formal and well-structured, but I notice some typos and spelling errors like "mert" instead of "met", "undrr" for "under", "groupcof" for "group of", etc. These are minor but frequent. The grammar seems okay, but there are awkward phrasings, like "it is well known that this is a Norman form for the east end, it must not be supposed that this apse was built in the time of Eadgar". Some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. Also, inconsistent spacing and missing articles here and there. Despite these, the text is generally readable, so Fluency score might be around 4, considering minor issues but overall clear.

Now Coherence. The text follows a logical structure: history, architecture, abbesses. However, there are abrupt shifts between historical events and architectural details without clear transitions. For example, jumping from Eadgar's church to the Norman part without a smooth link. Some parts feel disconnected, like the story of Æthelwold and Ælfthryth which, while relevant, disrupts the flow. The text assumes some prior knowledge of historical figures and terms (e.g., Benedictine Rule) without explanation, which might confuse readers. Despite this, the overall narrative holds together, so Coherence score might be 3.5, as there are noticeable issues but the main structure is clear.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "mert", "undrr", "groupcof", "spt", "kynd"). - [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "it must not be supposed..."). - [LEXICON] Rare archaic terms without context (e.g., "teffed", "kynd").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical and architectural details. - [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of historical figures/terms (e.g., Benedictine Rule, "Rlman legions"). - [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness in anecdotal inclusions (e.g., Æthelwold story).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
