Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Coherence is about how well the story holds together, logical progression, transitions, etc.

Looking at the text, it's a long narrative with multiple sections. The writing style seems somewhat archaic, maybe from an earlier period. There are some complex sentences and poetic descriptions. 

For Fluency: I notice a few grammatical issues. For example, in the sentence "Ancient into that convert she custom wealth shall household the precious father inherits bride from ’sthe betrothed her rules stones." That part is confusing and seems to have missing or misplaced words. There's also "Kuei eyes under of clerks of shop center underlings the the following parchment..." which is very unclear. Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. However, overall, the text is mostly readable despite these errors.

For Coherence: The story jumps between different time periods and scenes. There's a clear structure with sections like the wedding, life in Peking, and later reflections. However, transitions between these sections could be smoother. Some parts feel abrupt, like when Kuei Ping decides to leave and then returns without much explanation. The themes of tradition vs. freedom are consistent, but the narrative could be more tightly connected. 

Scoring Fluency: There are noticeable errors but the text is generally readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are issues, they don't completely disrupt understanding.

Scoring Coherence: The story has some disjointed parts and abrupt shifts, but overall it's manageable. Maybe a 3 as well, since the coherence is generally there but with some weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Ancient into that convert...")  
- [GRAMMAR] Sporadic missing/inconsistent verb tenses and pronoun references  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "whilst") and overly poetic phrasing  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt time jumps (e.g., graduation memory, return to compound) without clear transitions  
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected scenes (e.g., shift from opium struggle to pilgrimage)  
- [LOGIC] Underdeveloped character motivations (e.g., Kuei Ping’s sudden return home)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
