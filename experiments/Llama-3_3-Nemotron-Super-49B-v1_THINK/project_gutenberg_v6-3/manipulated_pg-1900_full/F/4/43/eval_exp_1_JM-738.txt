Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is an analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang. I need to assess Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense, filled with literary analysis, character discussions, and theories. The writing is formal, maybe a bit archaic since it's from Andrew Lang (late 19th/early 20th century). I notice some complex sentences, which might affect readability. For example, long paragraphs without clear breaks could make it hard to follow. Also, there are terms like "fianc√©e", "lay precentor", and references to other works by Dickens that might require some background knowledge. Are there grammar or spelling issues? Scanning through, I don't see obvious errors, but there's a lot of quoted material which might have archaic spellings or punctuation. The structure of sentences is mostly clear, but some are very long and convoluted. 

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between discussing the novel's plot, analyzing characters, presenting different theories (Forster, Proctor, Walters), and Lang's own conclusions. There's a clear structure with chapters like "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY" and "CONCLUSION", but the transitions between ideas might feel abrupt. For instance, moving from Forster's evidence to Collins's drawings without a smooth link. The author assumes the reader is familiar with the novel and its context, which could make it less coherent for someone not knowing "Edwin Drood". However, within each section, the logic holds, even if the overall flow is dense.

Fluency Score: The text is mostly fluent but with some minor issues from complexity and archaic language. Maybe a 4, since it's well-structured but challenging due to style and content.

Coherence Score: The structure is there, but the dense analysis and assumptions of prior knowledge might reduce coherence for some readers. Maybe a 3.5, as it's generally coherent but has some disjointed sections and heavy reliance on context.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [COMPLEXITY] Overly dense and complex sentence structures; archaic vocabulary and references may hinder readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [ASSUMPTION OF CONTEXT] Assumes deep familiarity with the novel and its literary context; abrupt transitions between theoretical discussions.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  

Your assessment of the text:  
The text is densely analytical with formal, archaic language, making fluency **4** (mostly fluent but challenging). Coherence is **3.5** due to context assumptions and abrupt transitions, though logical within sections.
