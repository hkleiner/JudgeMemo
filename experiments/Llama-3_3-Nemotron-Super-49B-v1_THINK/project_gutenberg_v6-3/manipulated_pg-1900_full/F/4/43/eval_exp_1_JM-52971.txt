Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues. 

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, so I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexical issues. Scanning through, I notice some awkward phrasing, like "It is very logical to assume that, over the long period of time man has been in and around the area, someone climbed down and looked." The structure here is a bit clumsy. Also, there are sentences that are very long and convoluted, which might affect readability. For example, the part about the midden circles explanation by Mera has a long, complex sentence. 

Spelling-wise, I didn't spot any obvious errors, but there might be some minor ones. Lexical choices seem mostly appropriate, but terms like "cannibal coal" (should be "cannel coal") stand out. 

Now, coherence. The text has multiple chapters, which is good for structure. However, transitions between ideas could be smoother. For instance, moving from discussing the Basketmakers to the Apaches feels a bit abrupt without clear connectors. Also, some sections repeat information, like the explanation of midden circles versus Apache mescal pits, which might confuse readers. The logical flow is generally there, but some parts feel disjointed. 

For fluency score: The text is mostly readable but has noticeable issues with sentence structure and some word choices. It's not highly fluent but not severely impaired either. Maybe a 3.5?

For coherence: The structure is there, but transitions are weak, and some sections feel disconnected. Repetitions and abrupt shifts exist. So around 3?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in long, convoluted sentences (e.g., "It is very logical to assume...").  
- [LEXICON] Minor lexical oddities (e.g., "cannibal coal" instead of "cannel coal").  
- [STRUCTURE] Frequent use of simplistic sentence structures (e.g., repeated "Then" or "And" openings).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., Basketmakers to Apaches without clear connectors).  
- [REPEAT] Redundant explanations (e.g., midden circles vs. Apache pits).  
- [STRUCTURE] Weak chapter-to-chapter logical flow (e.g., disjointed discussion of cultural traits).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
