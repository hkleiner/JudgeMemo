Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the metrics: Fluency and Coherence. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text.

Looking at the text, it's a biographical piece about Meissonier. The structure seems chronological, moving from introduction to early years, first successes, etc. The language is formal, maybe a bit archaic since it's about a 19th-century artist. 

For Fluency: I notice some long sentences, which might affect readability. Are there any grammatical errors? Let me check. The text uses complex structures but seems mostly error-free. However, there are a few places where the sentence structure is convoluted. For example, "The said tendency did not fail to awaken anxiety in M. Meissonier, the father." That's a bit wordy but not incorrect. Also, some sentences are very long, like the one describing Meissonier's method of getting the Emperor to pose. That might make fluency drop a bit, but overall, the writing is polished. Maybe a score of 4.5? It's mostly fluent but has some minor issues with sentence length.

For Coherence: The chapters are clearly divided, and each part transitions logically. The anecdotes support the overall narrative about Meissonier's dedication to realism. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like jumping from his early life to etchings without a clear connector. Also, the section on "ETCHINGS" feels a bit like a side note. The text assumes some prior knowledge of art history, which might confuse readers not familiar with the context. But overall, the structure is logical. Maybe a coherence score of 4? There are a few weak transitions but generally coherent.

Wait, the user mentioned "half-points allowed." For Fluency, maybe 4.5 because while mostly excellent, the lengthy sentences and some wordiness deduct a bit. For Coherence, 4 since the structure is good but with minor disconnects and assumptions about background knowledge.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures and excessive length hinder immediate clarity.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor abrupt transitions between thematic sections (e.g., "ETCHINGS" chapter feels slightly tangential). - [CLARITY] Assumes prior art historical context without explicit explanation.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
