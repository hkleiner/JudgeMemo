Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific labels and a Likert scale. 

First, I'll read through the text to get a general sense. The text appears to be a scholarly or academic piece discussing early woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts. It's quite lengthy and dense, with detailed descriptions and historical references.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text uses complex sentences, some of which are very long and convoluted. For example, there's a sentence that starts with "The most part of these books..." and goes on for multiple clauses without clear breaks. This might make reading difficult. Also, there are archaic terms like "mediæval" and "thirteenth and fourteenth centuries" which are correct but might slow down a modern reader. I noticed some repetitive phrases, like "the thing" used multiple times, which seems like a placeholder or error. That's definitely a problem. There's also a part where the author says "a stuff" repeatedly, which is confusing. These placeholders disrupt the flow. 

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas connect, logical flow, transitions, etc. The text has multiple chapters and sections, but the transitions between them aren't always smooth. For instance, the shift from discussing woodcut books to the chapter on illuminated manuscripts feels a bit abrupt without a clear connector. There are also lists of books and printers without clear explanations of their significance beyond being examples. The author assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the topic, which might make it hard for non-experts to follow. Some paragraphs are overly detailed, like the description of the "S" initial, which, while interesting, might not be essential for the overall argument and disrupt the flow.

For Fluency score: Despite some complexity, the text is mostly readable. The errors (like "a stuff") are significant but not pervasive. I'd say a 3.5 because while there are issues, the overall structure is manageable. 

For Coherence score: The text has some disconnects between sections and assumes background knowledge. However, the overall structure is there, even if transitions are weak. Maybe a 3 because it's generally coherent but with noticeable flaws.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences with multiple nested clauses.  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms ("mediæval") and unclear placeholders ("a stuff", "the thing").  
- [SPELLING] No overt spelling errors, but archaic spellings may impede readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., woodcuts to illuminated manuscripts).  
- [CLARITY] Assumes specialized knowledge without contextualization (e.g., printer names, historical periods).  
- [TRANSITION] Lists of examples lack explanatory connections to broader arguments.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
