Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the text based on Fluency and Coherence using specific scales. Each metric has its own criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. The scale goes from 1 (unintelligible) to 5 (highly fluent). 

Looking at the text, it's a long narrative with descriptive passages. The language seems formal and old-fashioned, possibly from an earlier era. I notice some long, complex sentences that might affect readability. For example, sentences like "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet as her chair-bearers turned into the street..." are a bit awkward. There are also some archaic terms like "thing" which might be typos or intentional but unclear. 

Checking for grammar and syntax issues: The text mostly uses correct grammar, but there are some awkward phrasings. For instance, "the more precious jewels glow with a warmer brilliancy when the day outside is dark." The word "brilliancy" is correct but less common, contributing to a slightly formal tone. Spelling seems okay, but "thing" appears multiple times without context, which is confusing. Maybe it's a placeholder or a mistranslation. 

Lexicon issues: Some words are outdated or overly formal (e.g., "passively quiet", "brilliancy"), which might make the text less fluent for modern readers. However, the vocabulary is generally rich and appropriate for a descriptive piece.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, etc. The scale also goes from 1 to 5. 

The text has multiple sections separated by "Wherein" headings, each describing a different part of Kuei Ping's life. The structure is somewhat episodic, jumping through time. Transitions between sections could be smoother. For example, the shift from the wedding to the later life with Fuh Tang feels a bit abrupt. There's also a lot of cultural context assumed, like the significance of the Street of Precious Pearls or certain customs, which might confuse readers without background knowledge. 

However, each section internally has a clear narrative flow. The character development of Kuei Ping is consistent, showing her growth from a traditional bride to someone seeking independence and later finding balance. The themes of cultural conflict and personal growth are well-connected throughout.

Potential coherence issues: The non-linear structure and lack of clear transitions between life stages might disrupt flow. Some parts feel repetitive, like the descriptions of family gatherings, but they serve to show the passage of time. 

Assessing the scores:

For Fluency, despite some awkward phrasing and formal language, the text is mostly readable. The issues are minor but noticeable, so maybe a 4? It's mostly fluent but has some stylistic choices that might distract.

For Coherence, the overall narrative is clear, but the structure is a bit disjointed. The themes hold it together, so maybe a 4 as well. There are some weak connections but no major breakdowns.

Wait, but the Fluency scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." The text's formal style and some word choices might be intentional for the period, so maybe it's more a stylistic choice than an error. However, the archaic language could affect modern fluency. Also, the repeated use of "thing" is a problemâ€”maybe a typo for "family" or another term. That's a clear error affecting clarity.

Coherence: The sections are distinct but linked by Kuei Ping's journey. The transitions could be better, but the coherence within each section is good. So maybe Coherence is a 4, Fluency a 3.5 due to the "thing" errors and some phrasing.

Wait, the "thing" might be a critical issue. If "thing" is supposed to be "family" or another term, that's a recurring error causing confusion. That would deduct more points. But if it's intentional (though unlikely), it's just unclear. Assuming it's an error, Fluency score might drop to 3.5. Coherence, while the structure is episodic, the overall story makes sense, so maybe 4.

Finalizing:

Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING/TYPO] Repeated use of "thing" without clarification.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "passively quiet", "brilliancy").
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures.

Fluency Score: 3.5 (Generally readable but with noticeable issues.)

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Episodic structure with abrupt transitions between life stages.
- [CLARITY] Assumes cultural knowledge without explanation (e.g., customs, "thing").

Coherence Score: 4 ( Mostly coherent with some weaknesses in transitions and clarity.)
