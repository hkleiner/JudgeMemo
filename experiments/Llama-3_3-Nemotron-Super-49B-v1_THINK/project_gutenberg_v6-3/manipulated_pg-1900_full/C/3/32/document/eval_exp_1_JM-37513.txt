Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long and dense, written in a formal, philosophical style. First, I need to assess Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. 

Looking through the text, I notice that the sentences are complex and long, which might make them hard to follow, but they seem grammatically correct. There are no obvious spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is advanced, with terms like "teleological," "noumenal," and "emergents," but that's appropriate for a philosophical discussion. However, the lengthy sentences and frequent use of parenthetical remarks could disrupt flow. For example, sentences like the one starting with "It is true that the affairs of the mind..." have multiple clauses that slow down the reader. Also, some phrases feel a bit archaic ("I would fain leave it altogether on one side"), which might affect readability for modern readers. So, minor issues but overall fluent. Maybe a 4 or 4.5 for Fluency.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas are connected, logical structure, transitions, etc. The text discusses Spencer's philosophy, critiques his use of terms like "force" and "cause," and compares him with Bergson. The structure seems logical, moving from introduction to detailed analysis to conclusions. However, the text jumps between different topics—like from Spencer's Unknowable to critiques of "cause" in science, then to cognitive relatedness—and some transitions feel abrupt. For instance, the shift from discussing Bergson's ideas to the section on "cause" and "conditions" might not be clearly signaled. There's also a lot of embedded quotes and complex concepts without clear summaries, which could confuse readers not familiar with the subject. The author assumes a high level of prior knowledge. Despite this, the overall argument is mostly clear, so Coherence might score around 3.5 or 4.

Wait, but the evaluation criteria for Coherence 4 says "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," and 3.5 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." Given the abrupt transitions and dense, assumption-heavy content, maybe 3.5 is better for Coherence.

Finalizing: Fluency is 4.5 (very fluent but some minor complexity issues), Coherence is 3.5 (mostly clear but some disjointedness and heavy assumptions).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaisms and overly complex vocabulary; - [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentence structures.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between philosophical concepts; - [CLARITY] Overreliance on assumed prior knowledge of Spencer/Bergson.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
