Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as given. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. Coherence is about how well the story holds together logically, with clear structure, transitions, and no disjointedness.

Looking at the text, it's a science fiction story. The first thing I notice is the extensive dialogue and the detailed world-building. The story has multiple scenes, characters, and a plot twist involving an ancient technology. 

For Fluency: I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or spelling mistakes. Scanning through, I see some intentional dialects like the Irwadian's lisp ("thith", "lithp"), which is stylistic and not an error. The narrative flows mostly smoothly, but there are long paragraphs and some complex sentences that might disrupt flow. However, I didn't spot actual errors in grammar or spelling. The use of italics for titles and foreign terms is consistent. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 5.

For Coherence: The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The plot progresses logically from the setup on Irwadi to the space journey and the reveal of the proto-man's world. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like when Margot suddenly decides to go to the teleporter without much buildup. The introduction of Vardin as proto-man feels a bit sudden, though it's hinted at earlier. The themes of power and the ethical implications of advanced technology are well-woven. The story mostly hangs together, but there might be some minor disconnects or convenient plot devices (like Vardin's sudden powers). Coherence score might be around 4, considering these minor issues.

Now, checking the specific criteria scales. For Fluency, since there are no major errors but some structural issues with long paragraphs and complex sentences, maybe a 4.5. For Coherence, the minor abruptness and the somewhat convenient twist with Vardin might deduct a point, so 4.

Wait, but the user mentioned "half-points are allowed". Let me double-check. The Fluency has mostly good syntax, minor structural flaws but no errors. Coherence has a clear structure but some minor gaps. So Fluency 4.5 and Coherence 4.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Occasionally long, complex paragraphs disrupt smooth reading flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt reveal of Vardinâ€™s true nature; minor plot convenience in climax.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
