Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text and identify issues related to fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking at the text, there are several places where sentences are a bit awkward. For example, in the acknowledgments, phrases like "if it answers only one question—the effort was well spent." That's a bit abrupt. Also, repeated use of "a thing" instead of proper nouns—like "a thing country" or "a stuff." That's probably a placeholder or typo, which disrupts fluency. There are also some unclear transitions between paragraphs, like jumping from discussing Basketmakers to the Comanches without clear links. 

For coherence, which is about the overall structure and logical flow. The text has multiple chapters, but sometimes the connections between them aren't smooth. For instance, the shift from Early Man to Basketmakers feels a bit disconnected. Also, there are abrupt jumps, like in the Mescalero Apache section where they talk about physical evidence and then suddenly mention a legend without a clear transition. Repetitions too, like explaining midden circles in two different chapters without cross-referencing. 

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, despite the issues, the text is mostly readable. The errors (like "a thing") are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally fluent but with multiple minor issues.

Coherence has more significant problems. The structure is there with chapters, but within chapters, there are jumps and lack of clear transitions. Some parts feel like lists (e.g., all the food items) without integration. So coherence score might be lower, around 2.5. It's not totally incoherent, but the issues are more impactful.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING/TYPO] Repeated placeholder terms ("a thing", "a stuff") indicating unresolved edits.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "if it answers only one question—the effort was well spent").  
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic phrasing (e.g., "whence they raided").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., Basketmakers to Comanches without contextual bridges).  
- [REPEPETITION] Redundant explanations (e.g., midden circles described in two chapters).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear causal links (e.g., Apache decline attributed to "pure supposition").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
The text exhibits noticeable fluency issues due to unresolved placeholders, awkward phrasing, and archaic vocabulary, but remains mostly readable (3.5). Coherence suffers from disjointed transitions, repetition, and speculative leaps, making the narrative harder to follow (2.5).
