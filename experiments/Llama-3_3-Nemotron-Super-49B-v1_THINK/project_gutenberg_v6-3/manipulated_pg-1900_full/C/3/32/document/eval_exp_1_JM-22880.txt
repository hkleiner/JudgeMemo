Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate a given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria and then provide scores. The text is quite long, so I need to carefully go through it and identify the issues in each category.

First, for Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text provided is a historical account of Romsey Abbey, written in a somewhat archaic style but generally formal. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or structural issues in sentences.

Looking through the text, I notice that the structure is mostly clear, with chapters and sections. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate for a historical text. However, there are some long, complex sentences that might make reading a bit difficult. For example, sentences with multiple clauses or historical references that require close attention. Also, there are placeholders like "a thing" which seem like missing terms or names. These placeholders could disrupt fluency because they're unclear and force the reader to pause. 

Are these placeholders errors? If "a thing" is a typo or omission, that's a problem. But maybe in the original context, they were meant to be filled in. Since the text has them repeatedly, it's likely an issue. Each instance of "a thing" where a proper noun or term should be is a fluency problem because it's confusing. So that's a [SYNTAX] or [LEXICON] issue.

Also, checking for grammar: I didn't spot obvious errors like subject-verb agreement or tense inconsistencies. The text uses Latin phrases and historical names correctly. So maybe the main fluency issues are the long sentences and the missing terms ("a thing").

Now for Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are connected, logical flow, transitions, etc. The text is divided into chapters, which helps structure. However, there are abrupt jumps between historical periods or topics. For example, moving from the etymology of Romsey to the history of the abbey without a clear transition. Also, some paragraphs discuss architectural details, then switch to stories about abbesses without smooth connections. 

There's a lot of detailed information, which might make the text feel disjointed if not properly linked. The chapter on abbesses introduces various individuals with stories that might not clearly tie back to the main narrative about the abbey's history. Also, the inclusion of poems or quotes (like the R. Browning reference) might disrupt the flow if not integrated well.

Potential coherence issues: lack of clear transitions between sections, abrupt shifts in topic (e.g., from architecture to specific nuns' stories), and possibly too much tangential information that doesn't contribute to the overall narrative structure.

Now, summarizing the most serious problems for each metric.

For Fluency:
- Repeated use of "a thing" as placeholders, causing confusion.
- Some overly complex sentence structures.

For Coherence:
- Abrupt topic shifts without transitions.
- Disjointed inclusion of various historical anecdotes or architectural details without clear connections.

Scoring: 

Fluency is mostly good except for the placeholders and complex sentences. Since "a thing" appears many times, it's a significant distraction. But the rest of the language is clear. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but with noticeable issues.

Coherence has more serious problems. The structure is there with chapters, but within chapters, topics jump around. For example, in Chapter I, moving from etymology to Roman history to the abbey's founding without clear links. Also, the stories in later chapters about individual abbesses feel somewhat disconnected from the architectural descriptions. This disrupts the overall flow, so coherence might be a 3, as it's generally coherent but with notable disruptions.

Wait, the scale for Coherence: Score 3 is "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments." That fits. Fluency's score 4 is "mostly fluent, minor issues." The placeholders are minor but frequent. So yes, 4 for Fluency, 3 for Coherence.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
   - [LEXICON] Repeated undefined placeholders ("a thing") disrupting clarity.
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, overly long sentences impairing readability.

2) Coherence Issues: 
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., historical events, architectural details, abbess anecdotes) without clear connections.
   - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative flow within chapters due to tangential information.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
