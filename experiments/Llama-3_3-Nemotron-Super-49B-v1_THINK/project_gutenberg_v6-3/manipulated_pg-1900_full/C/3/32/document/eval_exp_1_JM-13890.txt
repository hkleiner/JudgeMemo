Okay, let me try to figure out how to evaluate this text based on the given criteria. The user wants me to assess both Fluency and Coherence, using the specified scales and labels.

First, I'll start with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text provided is quite long and formal, written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. 

Looking through the text, I notice that there are many instances where "a thing" is used in place of proper nouns or specific terms. For example, "a thing monastery founded by Augustine," "the thing monastery," "a thing times," etc. This seems like a placeholder or a typo, which would disrupt the flow. Each occurrence of "a thing" is confusing because it's unclear what it refers to. This is a major issue under Fluency because it's not just a few typos but widespread, making parts of the text hard to understand. The label here would be [LEXICON] since it's a word choice problem, possibly due to missing or incorrect terms.

There are also some sentences that are very long and complex. For example, the paragraph starting "It would be a mistake to imagine..." has multiple clauses and historical references packed tightly. While the grammar seems correct, the complexity might make it hard to follow for some readers. However, since the grammar is correct, maybe this is more a Coherence issue regarding structure rather than Fluency. But the sheer length and density could affect fluency slightly.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are connected, the structure, transitions, etc. The text jumps between different historical periods and topics. For instance, Chapter I discusses the historical context of Becket's shrine, then Chapter II dives into Roman invasions, and later chapters describe the cathedral's architecture. While each chapter has its topic, the transitions between them might not be very smooth. There's a lack of clear connectors or summaries linking the historical events to the architectural descriptions. 

Also, the use of "a thing" again causes confusion because the reader has to infer what's missing, breaking the narrative flow. This would be a Coherence issue under [CLARITY] since the missing terms obscure the meaning. Additionally, some paragraphs are heavily loaded with historical details without clear signposting, which might make the text feel disjointed.

For Fluency score: Despite the archaic style, the grammar and spelling are mostly correct. The main problem is the "a thing" placeholders, which are frequent. Since these are not just minor errors but pervasive, they significantly interrupt the flow. However, the rest of the language is formal but fluent. So maybe a score of 3.5? Because it's generally readable but has major distracting errors.

For Coherence score: The text has a clear overall structure (chapters), but within chapters, the transitions between ideas are weak. The missing terms cause confusion, and the historical narrative isn't always logically sequenced. For example, jumping from Roman history to Saxon invasions without clear bridges. The score might be around 3, as it's generally coherent but with noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Widespread use of placeholder "a thing" obscuring specific terms/nouns, severely disrupting clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., nested historical clauses).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [CLARITY] Missing/inconsistent terminology ("a thing") fractures narrative continuity.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between historical eras and architectural descriptions without clear transitions.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
