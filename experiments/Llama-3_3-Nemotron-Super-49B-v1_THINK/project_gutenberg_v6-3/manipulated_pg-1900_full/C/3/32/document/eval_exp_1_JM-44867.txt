Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is "The Discovery of the Future" by H.G. Wells. First, I need to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the early 20th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice long, complex sentences which might affect readability. For example, the opening paragraphs have sentences with multiple clauses. However, despite their length, they are grammatically correct. The vocabulary is rich but not incorrect. There's no mention of spelling errors. The structure of sentences is mostly clear, though some are convoluted. So Fluency might be high but not perfect due to sentence complexity. Maybe a 4 or 4.5.

Now Coherence. The text explores the contrast between minds focused on the past vs. the future, applying it to morality, politics, and science. The structure starts with a distinction, applies it to various fields, discusses objections, and then moves into scientific prophecy and future possibilities. The transitions between sections seem logical, but there are some abrupt shifts, like moving from morality to geology. However, each part connects to the overall theme. The conclusion about humanity's future is visionary but follows from previous discussion. Some sections might feel a bit disconnected, but overall coherence is strong. Maybe a 4 or 4.5 here too.

Wait, but the text is quite long and dense. Are there any unclear transitions or confusing segments? The part where he discusses the inductive past and comparing it to the future might require close attention. Also, the shift to talking about Comte and positivists might slightly disrupt flow, but it's still relevant. Coherence score could be 4.5 because the overall structure holds despite some complexity.

For Fluency, despite complex sentences, there are no errors, so maybe 4.5. But the frequent long sentences might deduct a bit, making it 4.

So final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 4.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [COMPLEXITY] Excessively long, convoluted sentences impair readability despite grammatical correctness.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Occasional abrupt shifts between thematic sections (e.g., morality to geology).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
