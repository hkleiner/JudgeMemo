Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on Fluency and Coherence. Let's start with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text provided is quite long, so I need to scan through and find any issues.

First, looking for grammatical errors. The text seems mostly correct, but there are some sentence structures that might be a bit awkward. For example, "His hands trembled violently and the match flickered and went out." That's a bit simple, but not incorrect. Another part: "Marjorie thought: 'What a fool she is to cry like that! Her nose is red; she's a sight. I can control myself. I can control myself.'" The repetition of "I can control myself" might be intentional for emphasis, so maybe not a fluency issue. 

Spelling? I didn't notice any obvious typos. Word choice and phrasing? Some phrases might be old-fashioned (like "savage pity" or "palsied hands"), but that's style, not an error. Maybe "palsied" is less common, but it's correct. 

Syntax: The narrative jumps between different scenes and characters. For example, in Chapter III, there's a sudden shift to a description of a historical or philosophical text about Bahá’u’lláh, which feels out of place. That's more a coherence issue than fluency. 

Coherence is about how well the story holds together, logical sequence, connections between ideas. The main story is about Marjorie and Leonard's reunion and marriage during wartime. However, there are abrupt transitions. For instance, in Chapter III, after the beach scene, there's a paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh's teachings, which disrupts the narrative flow. Similarly, in Chapter IV, there's a historical description about the Industrial Revolution that seems unrelated. These inserts break the coherence. 

Also, some chapters (like Chapter II) switch perspectives without clear transitions, like moving from the wedding to Herbert's thoughts without smooth connection. The text includes unrelated passages (e.g., the part about Reynolds the painter, the travelogue in Chapter IV) that don't integrate with the main plot, causing confusion. 

For Fluency, despite some complex sentences, the text is mostly fluent. The main issues might be with some word choices or sentence simplicity, but not enough to detract heavily. Maybe a score of 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues. 

For Coherence, the disruptions from unrelated paragraphs and abrupt scene changes are significant. The story's overall structure is affected, so maybe a score of 3, as it's generally coherent but with noticeable problems.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary ("palsied", "savage pity") and simplistic sentence structures in emotional moments (e.g., repeated phrases like "I can control myself").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unmarked transitions between scenes (e.g., historical/philosophical inserts in Chapters III and IV disrupt narrative flow). - [CLARITY] Unintegrated tangents (e.g., Reynolds painter anecdote, Industrial Revolution passage) confuse the central storyline.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
