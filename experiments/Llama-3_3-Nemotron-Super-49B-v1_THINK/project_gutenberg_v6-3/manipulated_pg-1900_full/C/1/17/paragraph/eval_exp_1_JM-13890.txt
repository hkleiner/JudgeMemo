Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points. First, I need to go through the text carefully and identify the issues for each metric.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is quite long, so I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. The chapters are well-structured, and the sentences are mostly clear. However, there are some long, complex sentences that might disrupt flow. For example, in Chapter II, there's a sentence about the Roman settlement that's a bit convoluted. Also, there are some archaic terms like "thou" which might affect modern readability, but since it's historical context, maybe that's intentional. I didn't notice any major grammar or spelling mistakes, so Fluency is probably high, maybe a 4 or 4.5. But the lengthy sentences could be a minor issue.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas connect and the overall structure. The text has clear chapters with topics, moving from history to architecture. However, there are abrupt transitions between some paragraphs. For instance, in Chapter II, the switch from Roman history to the description of St. Martin's Church feels a bit sudden. Also, some sections like the part about the t'umu (which seems out of place) disrupt the flow. There's a random quote about being a painter and another about a girl named Marie, which don't relate to Canterbury. These sections are jarring and break the coherence. So Coherence might score lower, around 3.5 because while the main structure is there, these interruptions cause issues.

Wait, the user mentioned not to give corrections, just the issues. So for Fluency, the main problem is the complex sentence structures. For Coherence, the abrupt transitions and unrelated paragraphs.

Final scores: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent but some complex sentences), Coherence 3.5 (generally coherent but noticeable disruptions).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in historical descriptions (e.g., Chapter II)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., unrelated anecdotes in Chapter III)  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
