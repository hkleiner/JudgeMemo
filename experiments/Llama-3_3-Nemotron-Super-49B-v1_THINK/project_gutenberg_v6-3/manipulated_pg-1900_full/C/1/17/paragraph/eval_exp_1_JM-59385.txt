Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Coherence is about how well the story holds together logically, with clear progression and no abrupt shifts.

Looking at the text, it's a long narrative about Kuei Ping's life. The writing style seems old-fashioned, maybe from an earlier century. There are some complex sentences, but they mostly make sense. I notice a few places where the structure might be a bit awkward, like the sudden jumps between different parts of her life. For example, the transition from her wedding to her later life with Fuh Tang could be smoother. 

In terms of Fluency, the grammar and spelling seem correct, but some sentences are quite long and convoluted. That might affect readability. For instance, the description of the street and the pearl shop has intricate details but is a bit dense. Also, there are sections where the narrative shifts without clear transitions, like the part about Diderot and Boucher which feels out of place. Wait, that part actually seems like a misplaced paragraph. It talks about European artists, which doesn't connect to Kuei Ping's story. That's a major coherence issue.

Coherence-wise, the overall story follows Kuei Ping's journey, but there are abrupt inserts. The Diderot section is a problem because it disrupts the flow. Also, some scenes feel disconnected, like the part about the American Civil War (Appomattox) which doesn't relate to the main narrative. These are like copy-paste errors. The text also mixes different time periods and events without clear connections, making it hard to follow at times.

For Fluency, the main issues are the long, complex sentences and some awkward phrasing, but no major grammar errors. For Coherence, the biggest problem is those unrelated paragraphs and some disjointed scene transitions. The score for Fluency would be around 4 because it's mostly fluent but with some minor issues. Coherence would be lower, maybe 3, due to the serious disruptions from the misplaced paragraphs and some unclear transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., multi-clause narratives without clear pauses).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thou," "thee") may hinder modern readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt, unreferenced inserts (e.g., Diderot/Boucher, Appomattox) disrupt narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological leaps and unresolved tangents (e.g., philosophical/historical asides).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
