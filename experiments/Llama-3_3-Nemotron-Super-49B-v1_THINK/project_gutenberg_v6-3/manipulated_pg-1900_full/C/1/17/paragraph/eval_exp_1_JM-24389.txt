Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the specified criteria.

First, Fluency. The text is quite long, so I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. The writing style seems formal and descriptive, which is good. I notice some complex sentences, but they're mostly structured well. There are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward, like "the bitter chill smote him" which is poetic but might slow reading. Also, some transitions between scenes could be smoother, but overall, the language is rich and fluent. Maybe a minor issue with some lengthy descriptions, but no major errors. So Fluency score is likely high, maybe 4.5.

Next, Coherence. The story has a clear progression from Marche's arrival to his interactions with the family. The chapters are structured, and each part connects to the next. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like the insertion of the Bahá’u’lláh passage which feels out of context. Also, the switch to Adolphe and Marie in Chapter II seems disconnected. These breaks might confuse the reader. The themes of isolation and redemption are consistent, but some sections (like the historical raid description) disrupt the flow. Coherence score might be around 3.5 due to these disruptions.

Wait, the Bahá’u’lláh part and the Adolphe scene are jarring. They don't integrate well with the main narrative. That's a significant coherence issue. Also, the interfaith movement paragraph in Chapter III feels like a non-sequitur. These sections disrupt the logical flow. So maybe Coherence is lower, like 3.

But the main storyline within each chapter is coherent. The problem is the unrelated inserts. So Coherence score: 3.5 because the main parts are okay, but the inserts cause issues.

Finalizing: Fluency 4.5 (minor stylistic points but overall excellent), Coherence 3.5 (some major disruptions but mostly coherent otherwise).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, poetic phrasing may slow readability; - [LEXICON] Archaic expressions (e.g., "blue-bird weather") require contextual understanding.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unexplained inserts (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh, Adolphe/Marie, historical raids) disrupt narrative flow; - [TRANSITION] Some scene shifts (e.g., Chapter II’s eagle passage to Marche’s reflection) feel disconnected.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
