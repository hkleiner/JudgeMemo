Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a biography of Fran√ßois Boucher, structured in chapters. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might make it a bit challenging but not necessarily incorrect. I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, the first paragraph has a very long sentence with multiple clauses. While it's grammatically correct, the length might affect readability. Are there any grammatical errors? I didn't spot obvious ones, but the phrasing is sometimes awkward. Also, there are abrupt transitions between ideas, like jumping from Boucher's life to historical events without clear connections. That's more a coherence issue, though.

Now, Coherence. The text has clear chapters, but within them, there are jumps in time and topics. For instance, in "THE STUDENT" chapter, it mentions Tennyson and Victorian longevity out of context. That's a coherence problem because it disrupts the narrative flow. Also, there are sections that seem unrelated, like the part about Apaches and horses, which doesn't connect to Boucher's life. These abrupt shifts make the text harder to follow.

For Fluency score: Despite the complex sentences and archaic tone, the text is mostly readable. The issues are minor, so maybe a 4? But the frequent long sentences might deduct a point, making it 3.5?

Coherence score: The structure is generally clear by chapters, but there are several instances of unrelated content and poor transitions. The Tennyson part and the Apache section are major disruptions. So, maybe a 3 because while the overall narrative is there, the interruptions are significant.

Wait, but the criteria for Coherence 3 says "generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts". Yes, that fits. So Coherence would be 3. Fluency, considering the complex sentences but no major errors, maybe 4? Or 3.5 if the complexity is a bigger issue. Let me check the scale again. Fluency 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues". The long sentences are minor but noticeable. So 4 for Fluency. Coherence 3 due to the abrupt shifts and some disconnected parts.

Now, labeling the issues. For Fluency, the main problem is [SYNTAX] with overly complex sentences. For Coherence, [STRUCTURE] due to abrupt shifts and unrelated sections.

Final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures impair readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt thematic shifts (e.g., Tennyson/Victorians, Apache narrative) disrupt continuity.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
