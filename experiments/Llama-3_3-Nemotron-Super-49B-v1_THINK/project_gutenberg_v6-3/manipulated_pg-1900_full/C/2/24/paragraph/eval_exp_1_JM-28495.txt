Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and note down any issues related to fluency and coherence. 

Starting with Fluency: The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability for modern readers. There are long, complex sentences that could make it hard to follow. For example, the description of Excalibur's adventures has sentences that are quite lengthy and packed with details. Also, some phrases might be considered overly formal or old-fashioned, like "BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!" which uses "trem" for tram, and terms like "dernier cri" which not everyone might know. There's also consistent use of semi-colons and intricate sentence structures that could interrupt the flow.

Now, checking for grammar, spelling, or syntax issues. I didn't notice any outright errors, but the punctuation is heavy with dashes and semicolons, which might contribute to a slightly stilted flow. The dialogue tags are sometimes informal, like "said Eileen feelingly," which is acceptable but old-fashioned. Word choice is mostly good, but some terms are outdated.

For Coherence: The story has a clear structure, moving from the couple's attempt to get a dog to Excalibur's antics and the romantic subplot with the curate. However, there are abrupt transitions between chapters. For example, Chapter IV jumps to Excalibur's daily walks without much connection to the previous chapter's events. Some sections, like the train accident in Chapter VII, feel a bit disconnected from the main narrative flow. The character motivations, especially the curate's decision to leave, could be clearer. Also, the resolution with Lord Caversham feels a bit convenient without much buildup.

The text maintains a humorous tone consistently, which helps coherence. Ideas are mostly logical, but the shift from comedic dog stories to the serious train accident and its aftermath might disrupt the overall coherence for some readers.

Finalizing scores: Fluency is mostly good but has minor issues with style and sentence complexity, so maybe a 4. Coherence has more noticeable issues with transitions and some disconnected elements, so around 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [STYLE] Archaisms and overly complex sentence structures may impede modern readability. - [SYNTAX] Heavy reliance on semicolons and dashes disrupts flow. - [LEXICON] Occasional outdated terms (e.g., "dernier cri").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., Chapter IV). - [LOGIC] Convenient plot resolutions (Lord Caversham’s intervention). - [CLARITY] Motivations (curate’s departure, Eileen’s secrecy) lack explicit buildup.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
