Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as defined. 

Starting with Fluency: It's about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text provided is a literary piece, probably from the early 20th century given the style and vocabulary. The writing is descriptive and uses complex sentences. I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking through the text, the sentences are long and structured with proper grammar. There are some archaic terms like "duskier and vaguer" or "feminandos animos" (which seems Latin), but those are intentional for the period. I didn't spot any spelling mistakes. The word choice is rich but appropriate. So Fluency seems high. Maybe a 5, but I should check if there's any minor issue. The only thing might be some overly complex sentences, but they don't hinder understanding. So Fluency score is likely 5.

Now Coherence: How well the story holds together, logical sequence, transitions, etc. The narrative moves through chapters, each with a clear setting and progression. The characters' interactions make sense, and the plot unfolds logically from Marche's arrival to his relationship with Molly and the reveal about Herold's past. Transitions between scenes are smooth, like from the blind to the house. The only possible issue is the abrupt introduction of Herold's past in Chapter IV, but it's handled with a confrontation that explains everything, so it's coherent. The themes of isolation and redemption tie together. Coherence score is probably 5 as well.

Wait, but in Coherence, the scale says 5 is highly coherent with minor lapses not hindering understanding. Here, the backstory in Chapter IV is a bit sudden but well-integrated. No major gaps or confusing parts. So both scores might be 5. But let me double-check.

Fluency Issues: None detected. The text is well-written with no errors. So Fluency score 5.

Coherence Issues: The only minor point could be the shift in Chapter IV when Herold's past is revealed, but it's a pivotal plot point and well-explained. So maybe no major issues. Coherence score 5.

But wait, the user might expect some minor deductions. For Fluency, maybe the extensive descriptions could slightly interrupt flow for some readers, but the scale says 5 is "highly fluent" with minimal issues. Since there are no errors, it's a 5. For Coherence, the structure is solid, so 5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - **None**  
2) Coherence Issues: - **None**  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*The text exhibits exceptional fluency, with sophisticated, error-free prose and natural phrasing. Coherence is equally strong, featuring a logically structured narrative, seamless transitions, and well-integrated plot revelations. No significant deductions are warranted for either metric.*
