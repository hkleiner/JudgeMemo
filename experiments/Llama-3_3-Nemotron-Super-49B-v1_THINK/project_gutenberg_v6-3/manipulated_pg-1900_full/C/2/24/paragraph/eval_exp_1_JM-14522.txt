Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text provided is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. First, I need to assess Fluency and Coherence separately based on the criteria.

Starting with Fluency: The text is from the late 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. However, Wilde's writing is known for its wit and clarity. Checking for grammar, syntax, spelling—no obvious errors here. The vocabulary is rich but appropriate. Phrasing is mostly smooth, though some long sentences might affect flow slightly. Overall, it's highly fluent despite minor archaisms.

Now Coherence: The story has a clear structure—introduction of the Otis family, their interactions with the ghost, the climax with Virginia, and the resolution. Transitions between chapters are logical. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like the insertion of modern elements (GPS, QR code, etc.), which might disrupt coherence for some readers. These anachronisms could be seen as inconsistencies. The themes of humor, horror, and morality are well-integrated, though.

For Fluency Issues: The main point is the archaic language, which might cause minor interruptions but doesn't disrupt understanding. Score 4.5.

Coherence Issues: The anachronistic elements (tech references) disrupt the historical setting. Also, some scenes feel a bit disjointed due to these insertions. Score 4.

Final scores: Fluency 4.5, Coherence 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [ARCHAIC LANGUAGE] Slightly formal, outdated phrasing may interrupt modern readers' flow minimally.
2) Coherence Issues: - [ANACHRONISMS] Inconsistent tech references (e.g., GPS, QR code) disrupt historical setting. - [TONAL SHIFT] Humor/horror balance occasionally feels disjointed.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
