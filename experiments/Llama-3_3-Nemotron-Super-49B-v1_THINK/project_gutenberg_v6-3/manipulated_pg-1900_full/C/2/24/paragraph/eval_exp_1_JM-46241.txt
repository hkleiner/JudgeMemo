Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided scales. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's quite long, so I'll need to break it down.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a formal, somewhat archaic style, which might make it a bit dense. I notice long sentences with complex structures. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that runs on for several clauses. That could affect readability. Are there any grammar or spelling errors? Skimming through, I don't see obvious typos, but the vocabulary is specialized (e.g., "medi√¶val", "rubrishers", "pen-letter type"). The phrasing is mostly clear, but some sentences are convoluted. The use of semicolons and commas to separate long clauses might contribute to slight awkwardness. 

Now, Coherence. The text has two main chapters: one on woodcut books and another on illuminated manuscripts. The author jumps between discussing specific printers, their works, and broader artistic trends. There's a clear structure, but the transitions between paragraphs might feel abrupt. For instance, the shift from Ulm and Augsburg printers to the chapter on illuminated books could be smoother. The author assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the subject, which might make it hard for non-experts to follow. However, within each section, the points are logically connected. The use of transitional phrases is present but could be more consistent.

For Fluency, the main issues are complex sentence structures and specialized vocabulary, which might hinder smooth reading. However, there are no major errors, so it's mostly fluent but with some minor obstacles. 

For Coherence, the structure is overall logical, but the dense subject matter and lack of clear transitions between some sections might cause confusion. The text stays on topic but requires careful reading. 

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly fluent (score 4) but has minor issues from complexity. 

Scoring Coherence: Mostly coherent (score 4) with some slight disconnects in transitions and assumed knowledge.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [COMPLEXITY] Overly complex sentence structures and specialized vocabulary may hinder smooth reading.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITIONS] Abrupt shifts between specific examples and broader themes; - [ASSUMPTIONS] Assumes specialized knowledge without clarification.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
