Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any fluency and coherence issues. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are a few things that catch my eye. For example, "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" – "passively quiet" seems a bit redundant; maybe just "sat quietly" would be better. Also, "the hour grew on" is an unusual phrasing; usually, we say "as the hour grew" or "as time passed." There's also "lustrous heap of jewels" which is a bit awkward, perhaps "lustrous collection" sounds smoother. Another spot: "Impelled by their drawing power" – "drawing power" is a bit formal and might be clearer as "attracted by their beauty." Lastly, "the utter futility of attempting to make East and West understand each other" feels a tad melodramatic, but maybe that's intentional for the character's emotional state.

Now for Coherence. The story shifts between the present scene at the jewel shop and Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school. The transition at "With a suddenness..." might feel abrupt. The reader is suddenly taken back in time without a clear transition, which could disrupt flow. Also, the connection between her past desire for freedom and the current jewel selection isn't fully explicit; it's there, but maybe needs smoother linking. The ending also feels a bit rushed, with the bargain closing quickly and the exit from the shop. 

Scoring Fluency: Despite some minor phrasing issues, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. So maybe a 4.

Coherence: The abrupt memory shift and the somewhat rushed conclusion are notable. The overall structure is logical, but those transitions could be better. So a 4 as well, but maybe 3.5 because the transition is quite jarring. Wait, the memory flashback is a common technique, but the abruptness might reduce coherence. However, the rest of the narrative connects well. Hmm, perhaps 3.5 for coherence because while the main parts connect, the flashback's abruptness and the quick resolution at the end affect the smoothness.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "Passively quiet" (redundant phrasing).  
- [PHRASING] "The hour grew on" (uncommon structure).  
- [SYNTAX] "Lustrous heap of jewels" (awkward noun pairing).  
- [LEXICON] "Drawing power" (formal/ambiguous term).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to memory flashback without clear signal.  
- [STRUCTURE] Rushed conclusion to jewel selection and exit.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
