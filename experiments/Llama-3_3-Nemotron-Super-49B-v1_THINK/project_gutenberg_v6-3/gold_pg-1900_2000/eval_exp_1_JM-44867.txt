Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and analyze it based on the given criteria for Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and written in a 19th or early 20th-century style, which might affect readability for modern readers. The sentences are long and complex, with multiple clauses. While the grammar and syntax seem mostly correct, the phrasing is somewhat archaic. Words like "æsthetic" (which should be "aesthetic") and "mediæval" (modernized to "medieval") stand out as possible spelling issues, though they might be intentional for the style. There's also the use of "THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE" in all caps, which could be a title and not an error. The main issue here is the antiquated vocabulary and sentence structure, which might make the text less fluent for contemporary readers. However, there are no glaring grammatical errors, so the fluency is mostly maintained despite the challenging style.

Now, Coherence. The text explores a clear distinction between two types of minds: one focused on the past and the other on the future. The author uses various examples (legal vs. legislative, moral dilemmas, historical wars) to support the argument. The structure is logical, starting with defining the types, then contrasting them, addressing potential objections, and providing examples. Transitions between paragraphs are smooth, and the author signposts the discussion (e.g., "But before pointing out..."). However, the text is dense and assumes a high level of sophistication from the reader. Some paragraphs are very long, which might disrupt flow, but overall, the coherence is strong. The only minor issue might be the abrupt shift in the last paragraph about wars, but it's still relevant.

For Fluency Score: The text is mostly fluent but with minor issues due to style. Maybe a 4 because it's well-structured but has some archaic elements.

For Coherence Score: Highly coherent with a clear progression. Maybe a 5, but check if there are any weak links. The examples support the thesis well, and the structure is organized. So 5 seems right.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "æsthetic", "mediæval") and overly formal tone may reduce readability for modern audiences.  
- [SYNTAX] Extremely long, complex sentences with nested clauses (e.g., "Most of us...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly dense paragraphs (some exceeding 20 lines) disrupt pacing.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes advanced familiarity with philosophical and historical contexts (e.g., "Plantagenet and Lancastrian England").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
