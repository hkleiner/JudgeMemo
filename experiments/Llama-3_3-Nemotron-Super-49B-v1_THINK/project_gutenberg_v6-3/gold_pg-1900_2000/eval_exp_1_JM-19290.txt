Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is well-structured, with proper grammar and spelling. The sentences are mostly clear and flow smoothly. However, there are some long, complex sentences that might make reading a bit difficult. For example, the first paragraph in the PREFACE has a sentence that's quite long: "His vision of humanity as one people and of the earth as a common homeland, dismissed out of hand by the world leaders to whom it was first enunciated over a hundred years ago, has today become the focus of human hope." That's a bit of a mouthful. Also, some phrases like "the most remarkable development of contemporary religious history" are a bit formal but not necessarily errors. I didn't spot any grammatical errors, but the word choice is sometimes overly formal, which might affect readability for some readers. So fluency issues would be under SYNTAX for complex sentences and LEXICON for formal vocabulary.

Now for coherence. The text is generally well-organized, moving from the centenary announcement to Bahá’u’lláh's life and impact. Each chapter transitions smoothly. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like in the BIRTH OF A NEW REVELATION chapter when it jumps from describing the millennial movements to the specific story of the Báb without a clear connection. Also, the transition from the historical context to Bahá’u’lláh's personal experience in the dungeon feels a bit sudden. There's a lot of detailed historical information that might overwhelm the reader, making the narrative a bit dense. So coherence issues would be under TRANSITION for abrupt shifts and STRUCTURE for information density.

Scoring fluency: Mostly fluent but with some minor issues. Maybe a 4.5? Because the issues are minor and don't disrupt readability much.

Coherence: Mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The transitions could be better, and the density of information might confuse some readers. So maybe a 4?

Wait, let me double-check. For fluency, the complex sentences are noticeable but don't hinder understanding too much. So 4.5 is right. For coherence, the structure is clear overall, but those transitions and the packed information might deduct a point. So 4 for coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth readability. - [LEXICON] Occasionally formal vocabulary (e.g., "inescapable," "convulsed") could slightly alienate casual readers.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from historical context (e.g., millennial movements) to Bahá’u’lláh’s personal narrative. - [STRUCTURE] Dense, uninterrupted blocks of historical exposition risk overwhelming the reader.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
