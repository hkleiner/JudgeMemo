Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite old, written in a 19th-century style, which might affect readability. I notice long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the first paragraph has sentences that are very long and packed with details. This could make the flow a bit awkward for modern readers. Also, there are archaic terms like "Savages" and "Squaw," which might not be considered appropriate today, affecting lexicon. Checking for grammar and spelling, I don't see obvious errors, but the phrasing is definitely formal and less fluent by today's standards. So Fluency might score a 4 because while it's mostly clear, the outdated style and sentence structure cause some interruptions.

Now, Coherence. The text is structured with chapters, which helps. Each chapter seems to focus on a topic: Introduction, Circular Rainbows, First White Visitor. Within each, ideas are logically connected. However, the transitions between chapters might feel a bit abrupt without clear links. For instance, moving from legends to the science of rainbows and then to the first white visitor feels like separate topics without smooth transitions. Also, some paragraphs are dense with information, like the detailed descriptions of where to see rainbows, which could confuse readers. But overall, the narrative follows a logical path, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor weaknesses in transitions and paragraph connectivity.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "Savages," "Squaw") and overly formal tone.  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, complex sentences with multiple nested clauses.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., legends to scientific explanations).  
- [CLARITY] Dense, repetitive descriptions (e.g., rainbow viewing locations).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
