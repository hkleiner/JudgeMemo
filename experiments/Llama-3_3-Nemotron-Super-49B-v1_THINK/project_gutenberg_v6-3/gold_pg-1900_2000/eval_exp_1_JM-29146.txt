Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as provided. 

Starting with Fluency: The text is a sci-fi story with dialogue and descriptive passages. I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The first thing I notice is the consistent lisp in the Irwadian characters' dialogue (e.g., "ith" instead of "is", "th" instead of "th" but exaggerated). That's intentional for their speech pattern, so not a fluency issue. However, there are some minor punctuation issues, like missing articles or slight awkward phrasing in a few places. For example, "the Polaris was a Centaurian ship he'd been scheduled to take through hyper-space on the run from Irwadi to Centauri III." The phrase "on the run" might be a bit unclear; maybe "route" would be better. But overall, the text flows well with clear sentences. Most errors are minor and don't disrupt reading.

Now Coherence: The story has a clear structureâ€”introduction of conflict (planetarization), Ramsey's interaction with the officer, then his helping Englander, and the gambling scene. The transitions between scenes are smooth. However, there's a jump from Ramsey leaving Englander's place to the gambling hall without clear transition, but it's manageable. The subplot with the Earthgirl reading minds feels a bit abrupt and unconnected, which might confuse readers. Also, some sections, like the explanation about Irwadian body scales, interrupt the flow slightly but are relevant. The main issue is the Earthgirl's introduction and her panic without clear resolution or connection to the rest, causing a slight coherence drop.

So for Fluency, despite minor issues, it's mostly fluent. Score 4. For Coherence, the main problem is the unconnected Earthgirl segment and some info dumps, but overall logical. Score 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "on the run from Irwadi to Centauri III").  
- [LEXICON] Occasional word choice (e.g., "bitterly cold" repetition).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of the Earthgirl subplot (no resolution/connection).  
- [CLARITY] Info dumps (e.g., Irwadian body scales explanation) slightly disrupt pacing.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
