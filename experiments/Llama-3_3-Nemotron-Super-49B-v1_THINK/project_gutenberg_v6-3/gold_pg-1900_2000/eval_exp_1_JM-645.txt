Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text and check for fluency and coherence issues. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is from Henry James, known for complex sentences. I notice long, convoluted sentences which might affect readability. For example, "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?" is a bit tangled. Also, some archaic language like "fidgety habit" or "ormolu tables" might trip modern readers. Grammar seems mostly correct, but word choice is sometimes obscure. 

Now Coherence. The narrative jumps between the protagonist's thoughts and events. In Chapter II, the shift from the walk to the tea scene feels a bit abrupt without clear transitions. The dialogue, especially Vereker's comments, might confuse without context. The overall structure is logical, but some parts feel disconnected, like the sudden introduction of Miss Poyle's question at dinner. 

For Fluency score: Despite complexities, the text is mostly fluent. The issues are minor but noticeable, so maybe a 4. 

Coherence: The story holds together, but some transitions are weak. A few parts are confusing, so around 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "ormolu tables", "fidgety habit") may hinder modern readability. - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., nested clauses) occasionally disrupt flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt scene shifts (e.g., Chapter II’s dinner table introduction) lack smooth connective tissue. - [CLARITY] Subtle dialogue implications (e.g., Vereker’s "twaddle" comment) require inferential effort.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
