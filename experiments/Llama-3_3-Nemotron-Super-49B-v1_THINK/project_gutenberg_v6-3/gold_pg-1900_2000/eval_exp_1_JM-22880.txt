Okay, let me start by reading through the text carefully. It's about the history of Romsey Abbey, starting from the etymology of the name, through its founding, various historical events, architectural changes, and so on.

First, evaluating Fluency. The text is formal and uses complex sentences. I notice some long sentences that might make reading a bit difficult, but overall the grammar and syntax seem correct. There are no obvious spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is appropriate, though some archaic terms like "Sorbidonum" or "Venta Belgarum" might require knowledge, but they're properly contextualized. The only potential issue is the density of information and sentence length, but it's typical for historical texts. So Fluency score might be high, maybe 4.5 or 5.

Next, Coherence. The structure is chronological, starting with the name's etymology, then moving through historical events in order. Each paragraph builds on the previous one. Transitions between ideas are smooth. However, there are a lot of names and dates which could make it hard to follow for someone not familiar with the context. Also, some paragraphs are quite long without clear subsections, which might disrupt flow. But overall, the narrative is logical and well-connected. Maybe a minor deduction for density and lack of clear transitions between some paragraphs, so Coherence score around 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Dense, lengthy paragraphs with minimal transitional cues between historical segments.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
