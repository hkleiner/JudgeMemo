Okay, let's start by analyzing the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, fluency. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might make it a bit challenging for modern readers, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon. The sentences are long and complex, with multiple clauses, which could affect readability. For example, the first paragraph has a very long sentence that meanders a bit. There are also some repetitive phrases, like "as I have said before," which might disrupt flow slightly. However, the structure of sentences is mostly correct. I didn't notice any major grammar or spelling errors, but the vocabulary is formal and old-fashioned, which might make it less fluent for some readers. So, fluency score might be around 4, considering it's mostly well-structured but with some minor issues due to style and length.

Now, coherence. The narrative seems to follow a logical structure, introducing the setting, then focusing on La MÃ¨re Bauche and her establishment, and then the conflict with her son and Marie. The transitions between sections are smooth. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like moving from describing the hotel's operations to Madame Bauche's personal history without a clear transition. Also, the introduction of Marie Clavert feels a bit sudden, though it's necessary for the plot. The story elements connect logically, but some parts might feel a bit disjointed. For coherence, maybe a 4 as well, since the overall structure is clear but with some minor disconnects in transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences may impede readability.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and formal tone could reduce fluency for modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Some abrupt transitions between descriptive and narrative sections.  
- [CLARITY] Introduction of Marie Clavert feels somewhat disconnected from preceding context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
