Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story's coherence and fluency based on the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify issues in both categories.

Starting with coherence. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Midwest, specifically near the Mississippi River. The main points are the geographical features matching biblical descriptions and the author's personal observations. But I notice a lot of repetition. The author keeps emphasizing the beauty of the location and challenging readers to come see, which makes the narrative a bit redundant. There's also a lack of clear structure. The text jumps between describing the location, responding to critics, discussing geological aspects, and quoting other sources. It feels disjointed, lacking a smooth transition between ideas. 

Then there's the logic. The author assumes that because the area matches some biblical elements (like four rivers), it must be Eden. But this is a big leap without stronger evidence. They also mention that cyclones avoid the area due to geography, which seems speculative. The argument feels weak because it's based on incomplete comparisons and unproven assumptions. For example, comparing the Mississippi to the Euphrates just because of the name's sound doesn't hold water. 

Now for fluency. The writing style is archaic, with phrases like "I say unto you" and outdated vocabulary, which might make it hard for modern readers to follow. There are clear grammatical errors, like missing articles, incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "has appeared in brief articles"), and run-on sentences. The sentence structure is often convoluted, making some parts hard to parse. Spelling mistakes are present too, such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring". The author uses overly elaborate descriptions that, while poetic, become overly verbose and disrupt the flow. 

Also, the text includes non-standard formatting, like the title with dashes and inconsistent paragraph breaks. The use of all caps for emphasis (e.g., "THE AUTHOR") is distracting. There's excessive repetition of phrases like "Come and see!" which disrupts the fluency. 

For coherence score: The story lacks a clear, logical structure. Ideas are repetitive and not well-connected. The argument relies on weak assumptions. So coherence is poor, maybe a 2.

For fluency: Numerous grammatical, spelling, and syntax errors. Archaic language and overly complex sentences. Score here would also be low, maybe a 2 as well.

Issues: 
- [COHERENCE] Redundant repetition of claims without strong evidence.
- [COHERENCE] Lack of logical structure; abrupt transitions between topics.
- [COHERENCE] Speculative leaps (e.g., equating Mississippi with Euphrates based on name similarity).
- [FLUENCY] Archaic language and overly verbose descriptions.
- [FLUENCY] Grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, tense inconsistencies).
- [FLUENCY] Spelling mistakes (e.g., "admirirg").
- [FLUENCY] Disruptive formatting and excessive emphasis techniques.

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **2**
