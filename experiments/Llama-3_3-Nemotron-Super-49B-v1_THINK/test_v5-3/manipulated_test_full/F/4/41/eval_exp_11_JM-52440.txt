Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on the criteria for Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding what each criterion entails.

Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole. It should have logically sequenced ideas, be non-repetitive, smoothly connected, avoid ambiguities, and have a clear structure. Fluency focuses on how the text reads, including syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the story, it's a theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure is formal with chapters and sections, which is good for coherence. The author systematically addresses points, references church documents, and contrasts views. That seems logical and structured.

For coherence, I need to check if ideas flow well. The text moves from introduction to specific chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each chapter analyzes Church documents like Articles, Catechism, Homilies, and the Communion Service. The author uses transitional phrases and clearly states objectives, which helps coherence. However, the text is lengthy and dense, which might make it hard to follow for some readers. There's some repetition in emphasizing the Church's stance against Real Presence, but it's used for emphasis rather than unnecessary repetition. The structure is clear, so coherence is strong.

Now for fluency. The language is formal and somewhat archaic (e.g., "thou," "thee"), which might affect readability but is appropriate for the subject. Grammar and spelling seem mostly correct, but there are some typos like "Taughtvby" (should be "Taught by"), "ans" (and), "vlindly" (blindly), "inbdonnexionnwith" (in connexion with), etc. These are minor but present. Sentence structure is complex with long sentences, which can impede fluency but is common in academic writing. Word choice is appropriate, but some phrases are repetitive ("it is clear that" used multiple times). Punctuation is generally correct.

So, for Coherence, despite density, the structure and logical flow are good. Maybe a 4. For Fluency, the typos and complex sentences might deduct, but overall it's well-written. Maybe a 4 as well, but the typos might bring it to a 3. Wait, the typos are scattered but not overwhelming. Maybe 4 for Fluency too, considering the formal context.

Wait, the evaluation criteria mention that Fluency includes syntax, grammar, spelling. The typos, though minor, are present. So maybe Fluency is a 3? But the overall flow is good except for the typos. Hmm. Need to balance. Since the typos are present but the rest is fluent, perhaps 4. Coherence is definitely 4 because the structure is clear and well-organized despite length.

Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "Taughtvby", "ans", "vlindly", "inbdonnexionnwith").
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures.
- [LEXICON] Archaisms ("thou", "thee") may reduce readability for modern audiences.
- [STRUCTURE] Dense, lengthy passages without clear paragraph breaks in the provided text.
- [TRANSITION] Some repetitive phrasing ("it is clear that") used for emphasis.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
