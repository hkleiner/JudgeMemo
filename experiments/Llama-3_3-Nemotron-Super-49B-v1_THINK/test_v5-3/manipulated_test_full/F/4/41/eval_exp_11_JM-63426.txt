Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a lengthy autobiography of Will Bradley, divided into chapters. 

Starting with coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, logical sequence, connections between ideas, avoiding ambiguities, etc. The story is structured chronologically, which is good. Each chapter covers a different period in Bradley's life, which helps in organization. However, the narrative jumps between different events and includes various anecdotes. Sometimes, the transitions between paragraphs might feel abrupt. For example, in the "SECOND SOJOURN IN CHICAGO" chapter, there's a part about Bradley's pants ripping, which is a funny anecdote but might disrupt the flow if not smoothly integrated. Also, there are sections where technical details about printing or typefaces are discussed, which might confuse readers not familiar with the terminology. But overall, the structure is clear, and the use of chapter headings helps maintain coherence. 

Now, checking for coherence issues. The story might have some repetition, like mentioning the importance of Caslon typeface multiple times, but that's thematic and intentional. There's a clear progression from Bradley's childhood to his career milestones. However, some chapters, like "THE MAGAZINE WORLD--AN INTERPOLATION," provide background information that might interrupt the personal narrative slightly. But these sections are explanatory and help context, so they're justified. 

For fluency, I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text has some archaic language and sentence structures, which might make it less smooth for modern readers. For example, phrases like "the dear man!" or "God love them and the editorial lads" give a vintage feel but could affect fluency. There are also long, complex sentences, such as the description of Bradley's meeting with Richard Harding Davis, which might be hard to follow. 

Spelling and grammar: I noticed a few typos, like "AN INTEODUCTION" (should be Introduction), "ghe" instead of "the", "tkme" for "time", "yold" for "gold", "sjoes" for "shoes", "uppwrs" for "uppers", "Ckvil War" for "Civil War", "ylur" for "your", "movjes" for "movies", "dtartling" for "startling", "anfew" for "a few", "sleel" for "steel", "ut" for "it", "idda" for "idea", "experkence" for "experience", "envyry" for "every", "thd" for "the", "strret" for "street", "temperzture" for "temperature", "importznt" for "important", "thks" for "this", "msn" for "man", "envy" for "any", "q" used instead of "the" or "to" in several places, "fkr" for "for", "wjd" for "would", "bth" for "both", "vnd" for "and", "mch" for "much", "cnt" for "can't", "fisit" for "visit", "thb" for "the", "xs" for "as", "qnd" for "and", "v" for "of" or "in", "wth" for "with", "bt" for "by", "n" for "in", "qbout" for "about", "qnd" for "and", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qbout" for "about", "q" for "the", "qnd" for "and", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qnd" for "and", "qb" for "by", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qnd" for "and", "qb" for "by", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "q" for "the", "qb" for "by", "qnd" for "and", "qb" for "by",
