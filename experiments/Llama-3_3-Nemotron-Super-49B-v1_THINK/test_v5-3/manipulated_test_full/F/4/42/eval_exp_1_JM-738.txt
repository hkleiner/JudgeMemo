Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria properly.

Starting with Fluency: This involves grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text should flow smoothly without errors or awkwardness. Looking at the provided story, it's a critical analysis or scholarly essay about Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The language is formal and complex, with long sentences and literary references. I notice some archaic terms like "thou" in quotes, but that's probably from the original text. Are there any grammatical errors? The user mentioned "coulded" in the text, which is a typo for "could". There are a few instances like "woulded excuse himself" instead of "would excuse". These are minor but noticeable. The word choice is appropriate for an academic tone, but some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might affect fluency.

Now Coherence: This is about the logical structure, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections between ideas, and clarity. The text is an analysis with various theories and arguments. The structure seems to follow a logical path discussing different interpretations of the mystery. However, the text jumps between Forster's evidence, Mr. Proctor's theory, Mr. Walters's theory, and the author's own conclusions. There's a lot of back-and-forth which might make it hard to follow. The author uses transitional phrases, but the sheer number of theories and counterpoints could cause confusion. Also, the inclusion of the cover design analysis adds another layer that needs to be integrated smoothly, which it somewhat does but requires close attention.

For Fluency Score: Despite the formal tone and mostly correct grammar, the typos ("coulded", "woulded") and a few awkward phrasings (like "woulded excuse") deduct points. The long sentences might make reading challenging, but overall, it's well-written. I'd rate Fluency a 4 because the errors are minor and the language is mostly fluent.

For Coherence Score: The text covers multiple theories and critiques them, which is coherent in its own right, but the complexity and the need to track various arguments might reduce clarity. The structure is there, but the density of information and the shifts between different theorists' points could make it less clear for some readers. However, the author does connect ideas and uses headings, so it's not disjointed. I'd rate Coherence a 4 as well because while it's structured, the complexity and multiple layers might affect overall coherence for casual readers.

Issues to list: 
- [GRAMMAR] Typos like "coulded" and "woulded".
- [STRUCTURE] Complex, dense argumentation with multiple theory comparisons.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted.

Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Minor typographical errors (e.g., "coulded," "woulded") 
- [STRUCTURE] Dense, complex argumentation with frequent shifts between theories 
- [CLARITY] Overly long, convoluted sentences impair readability 

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
