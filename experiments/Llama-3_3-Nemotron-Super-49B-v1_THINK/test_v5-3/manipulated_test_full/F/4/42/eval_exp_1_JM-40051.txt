Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user wants me to evaluate this old story about the Garden of Eden being in Wisconsin or something. The task is to give a coherence and fluency score based on the criteria provided.

First, I need to read the story carefully. It's pretty long, so I'll have to skim through and note the main points. The author is claiming that the Garden of Eden is located between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota, along the Mississippi River. They use biblical references and geographical descriptions to support this.

For Coherence, I need to check if the story flows logically, ideas are connected, no abrupt jumps, and if the structure makes sense. The author starts with a principle, then moves into biblical context, describes the location, talks about rivers, scenery, and compares it to the Bible's Eden. There's a lot of repetition about the beauty and how it matches the biblical description. They also address potential critics and other theories, like Dr. Warren's North Pole idea. The structure seems a bit meandering, with many tangents (like the mound-builders, the lawyer's comment, etc.), which might disrupt the flow. Also, the author keeps inviting readers to come see, which is repetitive.

For Fluency, I'm looking at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. There are some obvious errors like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentionions" (dimensions), "scietist" (scientist), "acclimate" (maybe correct, but contextually odd), "supposedly" used incorrectly in some places. Punctuation is mostly okay but could be better. Sentence structure is often long and convoluted, making it hard to follow. Word choice is mostly appropriate but sometimes overly elaborate.

Now, listing the issues. For Coherence: 
- Repetitive assertions without adding new info.
- Tangents (mound-builders, personal anecdotes) that don't contribute much.
- Lack of clear transitions between sections.
- The argument relies heavily on assumption that matching some features proves it's Eden, without addressing counterarguments deeply.

For Fluency:
- Spelling mistakes.
- Grammar errors (e.g., "have ventured to publish it" after "having become thoroughly satisfied" feels a bit off).
- Syntax issues with long, confusing sentences.
- Archaic language that might hinder modern readability.

Scoring: Coherence might be a 3 because while the overall structure has a beginning, middle, and end, the repetitions and tangents hurt it. Fluency is probably a 2 due to the errors and archaic style making it hard to read smoothly.

Wait, but the author does link ideas somewhat, even if repetitively. Maybe Coherence is 3. Fluency, despite errors, the text is mostly understandable, so maybe 3? But the errors are noticeable. Let me check again. The spelling mistakes are several, grammar issues like "have ventured to publish it" after "having become" is correct, actually. Maybe the main fluency issues are the long sentences and archaic terms. So maybe Fluency is 3 as well. But the user's example in the problem had a Fluency score of 2 with similar issues. Hmm. Need to decide.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive assertions and lack of clear transitions between sections.
- [LOGIC] Assumes geographical features prove biblical identity without addressing counterarguments.
- [CLARITY] Tangents (e.g., mound-builders, personal anecdotes) disrupt focus.
- [GRAMMAR] Archaic sentence structure and occasional errors (e.g., "antldiluvians").
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "admirirg", "scietist").
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary hinders readability.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages and defensive arguments.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
