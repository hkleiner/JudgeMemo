Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the specified criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The author analyzes various church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies to argue against the Real Presence doctrine.

Starting with Fluency: The text is formal, complex, with long sentences and archaic language (e.g., "thou," "thee"). There are some grammatical errors, like "we was" instead of "we were." The vocabulary is rich but sometimes repetitive. Syntax is mostly correct but dense, which might hinder smooth reading. Spelling seems okay, but there are missing articles or incorrect verb forms occasionally. Overall, while there are minor errors, the language is generally fluent but challenging due to its antiquated style and complexity. I'd rate Fluency a 4 because the errors are minor and the text flows well despite complexity.

Now Coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter logically builds on the previous, using church documents to support arguments. Transitions between sections are smooth, and the author consistently contrasts Church of England teachings with Roman Catholic beliefs. However, the text is very dense and repetitive, reiterating points multiple times. Some paragraphs are overly long, which might confuse readers. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points. Coherence is strong in structure but weakened by redundancy and length. I'd give Coherence a 4 as well; it's well-structured but could be more concise.

Issues to list: For Fluency, note grammatical errors and archaic language. For Coherence, mention repetition and lengthy paragraphs.
