Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide a score for each. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria again. Coherence is about how the story unfolds logically, with connected ideas, no abrupt jumps, and clear structure. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and smooth reading.

Looking at the story, it's quite long and seems to be a 19th-century text arguing that a specific location in the US is the Garden of Eden. The structure is a bit all over the place. There are multiple sections, some that seem like different chapters or unrelated paragraphs. For example, there's a part about George Stransom and ghosts, which doesn't connect to the Garden of Eden topic. That's a coherence issueâ€”lack of logical flow and irrelevant sections.

In terms of fluency, the language is archaic with complex sentences. There are some grammatical errors, like "admirirg" instead of "admiring", and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions". Also, punctuation could be better; some sentences are very long and hard to follow. Spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (antediluvians) and "scenerys" (scenery) are present.

For coherence, the main problem is the disjointed structure. The author jumps between describing the garden, biblical references, personal anecdotes, and even what seems like a different story snippet. There's repetition too, like repeatedly inviting readers to "come and see". The transitions between ideas are not smooth, making it hard to follow the narrative thread.

Fluency issues include the outdated vocabulary (e.g., "litteral"), grammatical errors, and overly complex phrasing that disrupts the flow. Despite the effort to be persuasive, the writing is cumbersome due to long, winding sentences.

So, for Coherence Score: The story lacks a clear, logical structure. Unrelated sections break the flow. Repetitive calls to action without progression. Maybe a 2 because while the core argument is there, it's heavily obscured by poor organization.

Fluency Score: Lots of grammatical and spelling errors. Archaic language makes it hard to read, but it's mostly understandable. Syntax is often awkward. Maybe a 3 because despite errors, the text is mostly comprehensible, though not smooth.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative with unrelated sections (e.g., George Stransom passage, abrupt genre shifts).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between ideas (e.g., biblical analysis, personal anecdotes, promotional language).
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repeated "come and see" appeals without narrative progression.
- [GRAMMAR] Errors (e.g., "admirirg", "dimentions", inconsistent verb tense).
- [SPELLING] Mistakes (e.g., "antldiluvians", "scenerys").
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures.
- [LEXICON] Outdated vocabulary ("litteral", "Uphrates").

FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
