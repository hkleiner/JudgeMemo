Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on Coherence and Fluency. Let's start by understanding the criteria. 

Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole—logical sequence, non-repetitive, smooth connections, no ambiguities, clear structure. Fluency is about how the text reads—syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation.

Looking at the story, it's a non-fiction theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure is formal with chapters and sections, which is good for coherence. The author presents a clear argument, referencing Church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies. Each chapter tackles a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), which is logical.

But there are sudden inserts of unrelated texts, like the part about Princess Puffer, Millet's "The Sower", George Stransom, and others. These seem like pasted errors or unrelated excerpts. That's a major coherence issue because they disrupt the flow and confuse the reader. The main text is well-structured, but these interruptions cause abrupt jumps.

For Fluency, the main text has complex sentences but is mostly clear. However, the sudden inserts have different writing styles and topics, disrupting the flow. There might be minor grammar issues, but overall, the theological parts are well-written. The problem is the inconsistency due to the unrelated passages.

So, Coherence score: The main structure is good, but the random inserts cause severe disruption. Maybe a 2 or 3? Since the main content is coherent but the errors are significant.

Fluency: The theological text is fluent despite complexity. The inserts have different fluency (some are fine, others not), but the main issue is the inconsistency. Maybe a 3 or 4? Because the primary text is well-written, but the inserts affect overall fluency.

Wait, the inserts might not be part of the original story. Maybe they're errors in the input. If the actual story is only the theological text without the inserts, then coherence and fluency would be higher. But according to the given text, those inserts are present. So I have to consider them as part of the story.

Thus, Coherence: 2 (due to unrelated sections)
Fluency: 3 (main text fluent, inserts disrupt but aren't extremely ungrammatical)

Final Answer:
Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated inserts disrupt narrative flow; [CLARITY] Sudden changes in topic confuse context.
FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
