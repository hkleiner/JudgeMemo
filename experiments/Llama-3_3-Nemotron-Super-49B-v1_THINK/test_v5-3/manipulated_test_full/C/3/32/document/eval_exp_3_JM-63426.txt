Okay, let me try to tackle this. So, the user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story is quite long, divided into chapters, and it's about Will Bradley's life. 

First, I need to recall the evaluation criteria. Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole—logical sequence, non-repetitive, smooth connections, clarity, etc. Fluency is about how the text reads—syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation.

Starting with coherence. The story is biographical, structured chronologically with chapters. Each chapter seems to cover a different period in Bradley's life. The structure is clear, moving from his childhood to his career stages. However, the text includes a lot of specific details, names, and events which might make it a bit dense. There are also sections that feel like anecdotes or vignettes, like the part where the editor shoots the kerosene tank. These might be engaging but could disrupt the flow if not well-integrated.

I noticed some transitions between chapters could be smoother. For example, moving from "The Gay Nineties" to "Springfield: The Wayside Press" might need a clearer link. Also, there are parts where the narrative jumps, like the "Interlude in a stuff" chapter, which seems a bit out of place or not fully explained. The use of "a stuff" and "the thing" repeatedly as placeholders (probably due to redaction) causes confusion and breaks coherence. These redacted terms make it hard to follow specific references, leading to ambiguity.

For fluency, the writing style is generally formal, with complex sentences. There are some archaic expressions ("the stuff," "a thing") which are likely redacted terms, causing awkwardness. Spelling and grammar seem okay, but the redactions ("a stuff," "the thing") disrupt fluency badly. They make sentences unclear and force the reader to guess, which is distracting. 

Other fluency issues: Some sentences are long and convoluted. For example, the description of Bradley's appearance in "Interlude in a stuff" has multiple clauses. There's also excessive detail in some parts, like the descriptions of clothing and settings, which might slow the reading flow.

Now, considering the redactions: They are a major problem. Since the original text had placeholders like "a stuff" and "the thing" instead of actual names or terms, it's hard to understand certain contexts. This would definitely impact both coherence (because the narrative loses specific references) and fluency (because it's jarring to read). However, since the task is to evaluate the given text as-is, I have to consider these redactions as part of the text's issues.

Coherence score: The overall structure is logical, but the redactions and some abrupt transitions deduct points. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since the main narrative flow is mostly clear despite the redactions, but they do cause issues.

Fluency score: The redactions are a big minus. Without them, the text might score higher, but as given, the frequent "a stuff" breaks the flow. Grammar and syntax are mostly good, but the redactions and some long sentences bring it down. Maybe a 2 or 3?

Wait, the user's instructions say to use bullet points for issues with labels. Let me list the issues first.

For Coherence:
- Redacted terms ("a stuff", "the thing") causing ambiguity and disrupting narrative flow. [CLARITY]
- Some chapter transitions feel abrupt without clear connections. [STRUCTURE]
- Possible repetition or non-essential details slowing the pace. [STRUCTURE]

For Fluency:
- Frequent redacted terms ("a stuff", "the thing") leading to confusing sentences. [LEXICON]
- Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences. [SYNTAX]
- Archaic vocabulary or phrasing in some areas. [LEXICON]

Given that, Coherence might be a 3 because while the overall structure is there, the redactions and transitions are problems. Fluency is worse because the redactions directly affect readability. Maybe Fluency is a 2.

But wait, the redactions are not the author's fault but perhaps an error in the provided text. However, the task is to evaluate the text as given. So yes, they are issues.

So final scores:

Coherence: 3 (structured but with clarity and structure issues)
Fluency: 2 (significant disruptions from redactions and sentence complexity)

Issues: 
- Redacted terms ("a stuff", "the thing") cause ambiguity and disrupt narrative flow. [CLARITY]
- Abrupt transitions between chapters without clear thematic or chronological links. [STRUCTURE]
- Excessive specificity in historical/trivial details may slow pacing. [STRUCTURE]
- Redacted terms ("a stuff", "the thing") disrupt sentence
