Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the specified criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic beliefs. The author analyzes various church documents to argue against the Real Presence doctrine.

Starting with Fluency: The text is formal, using complex sentences and theological jargon. Grammar and spelling seem correct. However, the density of long sentences might affect readability. There's some repetition in ideas, like reiterating the distinction between the sign and the thing signified. Also, archaic terms ("a thing" likely a typo for "the Church") and missing words ("a thing more or less upon the subject") could cause confusion. These points might deduct from Fluency.

For Coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and logical progression from introduction to analysis of different documents. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author uses transitional phrases and references to previous points, maintaining flow. However, the text assumes prior knowledge of theological concepts, which might make it less accessible. Some paragraphs are very long, potentially disrupting the narrative flow. Also, the constant rebuttal against opposing views, while clear, might feel repetitive. These factors could slightly reduce Coherence score.

Now, categorizing the issues. For Fluency: [SYNTAX] for long complex sentences, [LEXICON] for archaic language, [STRUCTURE] for paragraph length. For Coherence: [CLARITY] due to assumed knowledge, [TRANSITION] for occasional jumps, [LOGIC] in repetitive arguments.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 due to mostly correct grammar but issues with readability and some errors. Coherence could be 5 if the structure and logic are strong despite some accessibility issues, but maybe 4 if the assumed knowledge and length detract too much.

Wait, the user mentioned "a thing" which is probably "the Church". That's a significant error, affecting Fluency. So Fluency score might drop to 3. Coherence, despite good structure, has some clarity issues, so maybe 4.

Finalizing: Fluency issues include syntax, lexicon, and errors ("a thing"), so 3. Coherence has clarity and transition issues but overall logical structure, so 4.

Issues: [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures hindering readability; [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "a thing" likely a typo for "the Church"); [STRUCTURE] Excessively long paragraphs; [CLARITY] Assumes prior theological knowledge without explanation; [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between document analyses; [LOGIC] Repetitive rebuttals without varying structure.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
