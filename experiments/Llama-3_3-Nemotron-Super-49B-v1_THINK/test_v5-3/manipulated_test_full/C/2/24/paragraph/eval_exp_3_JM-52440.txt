Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the specified criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The author analyzes various church documents to argue against the Real Presence.

For coherence, I should check if the ideas are logically sequenced, non-repetitive, and clearly structured. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author uses church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) in a structured way. However, the text is quite lengthy and dense. There might be some repetition in emphasizing the distinction between the Church of England's view and Rome's, but it's intentional for argumentative clarity. The transitions between chapters and sections seem logical.

For fluency, I need to look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The language is formal and archaic (e.g., "thou," "thee"), which might affect readability but isn't an error. There are long sentences, which can impede flow, but they're grammatically correct. No obvious spelling or grammar mistakes noticed. Word choice is appropriate for the topic, though somewhat outdated.

Potential issues for coherence: The text assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and church documents, which might confuse some readers. The structure is clear, but the depth of analysis might make it hard to follow without background. 

For fluency: The archaic style and lengthy sentences could reduce fluency for modern readers. However, since it's a historical or scholarly text, this might be acceptable. 

Now, assigning scores. Coherence: The structure is logical, each part builds on the previous, clear progression. Despite density, it's well-organized. Maybe a 4. Fluency: Formal language and long sentences affect smoothness, but no errors. Maybe a 4 as well, considering the context.

Issues to list: Under coherence, maybe "ASSUMPTION OF BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE" leading to clarity issues. Under fluency, "ARCHAIC LANGUAGE" and "LONG SENTENCES" affecting readability.

Issues: [COHERENCE] Assumes extensive theological background; [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on distinctions for argumentative clarity; [FLUENCY] Archaic language ("thou," "thee") and lengthy sentences; [LEXICON] Specialized vocabulary (e.g., "transaccidentation") without explanation.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
