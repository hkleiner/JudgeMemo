Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide scores from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the criteria. Coherence is about how the story unfolds logically, with connected ideas and no ambiguities. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc., making the text smooth to read.

Looking at the story, it's a 19th-century style text claiming to locate the Garden of Eden in the Midwest. The author uses a lot of descriptive language and biblical references. For coherence, I notice the structure is a bit meandering. The author jumps between describing the location, biblical interpretations, and responding to critics. There's repetition, like the constant "Come and see!" which might be intentional but disrupts flow. The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Also, some sections feel like separate essays (e.g., the part about Dr. Warren and Engel's book) that aren't fully integrated.

For fluency, the grammar and spelling seem mostly correct for the period, but there are some archaic terms and sentence structures that might make it hard to follow. Words like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring) stand out. The long, winding sentences could affect fluency. However, given the historical context, some of these might be intentional, but they still impact readability.

I need to list specific issues under each category. For coherence: lack of clear structure, repetitive calls to action, abrupt topic shifts. For fluency: archaic language, some typos, overly complex sentences.

Scoring coherence: The story has a clear central claim but poor organization and repetition. Maybe a 3? Fluency: Despite some errors and archaic style, it's mostly readable. Maybe a 4, but the typos and long sentences might bring it down to 3. Wait, the user specified to consider the period. If it's historical, maybe fluency is higher. But the task doesn't mention adjusting for period, so I should judge as is. The typos like "admirirg" are errors regardless. So Fluency might be 3 as well.

Wait, the evaluation criteria for fluency include syntax, grammar, spelling. The text has some spelling mistakes (admirirg, antldiluvians), which are deductions. Syntax is mostly okay but some long sentences. So Fluency score: 3. Coherence has issues with structure and repetition, so also 3.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Meandering narrative with abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, geographical description, and defensive arguments.
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repeated "Come and see!" appeals and defensive justifications disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg") hinder readability.
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., cyclone immunity, biblical correlations) lack coherent evidence.
- [TRANSITION] Poor paragraph linking; ideas feel disjointed (e.g., shift from geography to dairy statistics).

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
