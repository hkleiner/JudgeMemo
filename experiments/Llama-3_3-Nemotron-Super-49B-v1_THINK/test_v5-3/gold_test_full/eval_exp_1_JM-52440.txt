Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding the task. 

First, Coherence refers to how well the story unfolds, logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, clear structure, no ambiguities, and consistent narrative. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation making the text smooth.

The story is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. It's structured into chapters and sections, analyzing various documents like Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies. The author argues against the Real Presence doctrine, citing Church documents.

Looking at Coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and logical progression from introduction to specific topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter breaks down the argument using Church documents. However, the text is very dense and lengthy. There's a lot of repetition in emphasizing the distinction between the sign and the thing signified, and the author repeats points across different chapters (e.g., the distinction in Articles, Catechism, Homilies). This repetition might make it less concise. Also, the author sometimes uses emotional appeals (e.g., "Clever men and learned men may put forth such a theory, but common sense revolts against it") which might disrupt the logical flow for some readers. The transitions between sections are mostly clear, but the extensive quoting and detailed analysis might make the narrative feel heavy.

For Fluency: The writing is formal, with complex sentences. Grammar and spelling seem correct. However, the sentences are often very long and convoluted, which can hinder smooth reading. Word choice is appropriate but sometimes archaic ("thee", "thou"), which might affect modern fluency. Punctuation is correct but the density of the text with multiple clauses makes it hard to follow at times. There's no noticeable syntax errors, but the phrasing is often verbose.

Issues for Coherence:
- Repetitive explanation of the same theological distinctions across different documents.
- Emotional appeals interrupting the logical argument.
- Dense, lengthy paragraphs without clear subsections within chapters.

Issues for Fluency:
- Excessively long sentences.
- Archaisms in language.
- Verbosity making the text hard to follow.

Scoring:
Coherence: The structure is logical, but repetition and density deduct points. Maybe 4? But the repetition is significant, so maybe 3?
Fluency: Correct but hard to read due to complexity. Maybe 3 or 4. Since the sentences are correct but very complex, perhaps 3.

Wait, the evaluation criteria say Fluency is mainly about errors and smoothness. Since there are no errors but the flow is impeded by complexity, maybe Fluency is 4 (since it's more about absence of errors than readability). Coherence, despite structure, has issues with repetition and density, so maybe 3.

But let me check again. Coherence also values logical sequence and non-repetitiveness. The repetition across chapters (explaining the same point in Articles, Catechism, etc.) is a problem. So Coherence score might be lower, like 3. Fluency, despite complex sentences, has no errors, so maybe 4.

Yes, I think Coherence: 3, Fluency: 4.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive explanations across chapters (e.g., distinction between sign and thing signified repeated in Articles, Catechism, Homilies).
- [CLARITY] Dense, lengthy paragraphs without internal subdivisions.
- [TRANSITION] Emotional appeals (e.g., "common sense revolts") disrupt logical flow.
- [LEXICON] Archaisms ("thee," "thou") and overly formal tone.
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences hindering readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
