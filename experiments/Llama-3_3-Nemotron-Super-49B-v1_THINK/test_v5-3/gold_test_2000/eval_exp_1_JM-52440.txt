Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency using the given criteria.

First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. It's a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The author is arguing against the Real Presence doctrine, citing church documents.

For Fluency: Check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is formal, 19th-century style. I notice some long sentences, but they seem structured correctly. Words like "whilst" and "thou" are archaic but correct. No obvious typos or grammatical errors. Maybe some awkward phrasing due to antiquated language, but overall fluent. Score 5 for Fluency.

For Coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and headings. The author states the objective clearly in the introduction and follows through by examining Articles, etc. Transitions between ideas are smooth. However, there's some repetition in emphasizing the point about the Church's documents versus assertions. Also, the shift from discussing Scripture to focusing on Church documents is logical but could be smoother. Maybe some sections feel a bit verbose. Score 4 for Coherence because while it's well-structured, there's minor repetition and slight abruptness in transitions.

Now, list the issues with labels. For Fluency, maybe [LEXICON] for archaic terms, but since they're correct, maybe no deduction. Wait, the user said to list problems leading to point deduction. If there are no errors, then no issues for Fluency. For Coherence, repetition [STRUCTURE], minor transition issues [TRANSITION].

So, final scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 5.

Issues: 
- Repetitive emphasis on verifying Church documents vs. assertions [STRUCTURE]
- Slight abruptness in transitioning between scriptural context and examination of Church teachings [TRANSITION]

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
