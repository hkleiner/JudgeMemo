Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide scores from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads—syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Coherence is about the overall structure, logical flow, connections between ideas, and avoiding ambiguities.

Looking at the story, it's an old-style text, probably from the 19th century given the language and references. The author is arguing that a specific location near the Mississippi River is the Garden of Eden. 

Starting with Fluency. The text has archaic language, which might make it a bit hard to read, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue unless it's confusing. I notice some possible spelling errors like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "scietist" (scientist), "Bridtish" (British), "consitutes" (constitutes), "hightest" (highest), "jageed" (jagged maybe?), "Heald’s quarry" (proper noun, maybe correct). These are definite spelling issues. Also, sentence structure is sometimes complex and long, which might affect fluency. For example, the first paragraph has a long sentence with multiple clauses. Punctuation seems mostly okay but could be improved for modern readability. 

For Coherence, the structure starts with the author's discovery, then dives into biblical context, then location details. There's a mix of biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes. The transitions between these sections might be abrupt. For instance, moving from the biblical description to the location in Wisconsin without a clear link. The author assumes the reader is familiar with certain biblical interpretations and the region's geography. There's some repetition, like emphasizing the beauty and the presence of snakes. The logic connecting the location to Eden relies on vague similarities (like river names and snake presence) which might not be convincing, leading to coherence issues. 

So for Fluency, the main problems are spelling errors and somewhat convoluted sentences. For Coherence, the structure is a bit disjointed, assumptions without explanation, and weak logical connections. 

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while there are errors, the text is mostly readable. Coherence could be a 2 due to the disjointed structure and lack of clear logical progression.

Issues: [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "scietist", "Bridtish", "hightest", "jageed"). [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures. [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "veritable", "fancied", "behoof"). [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, personal anecdote, and geographical description. [LOGIC] Weak, unsubstantiated claims linking location to Eden (e.g., snake presence, river names). [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with regional geography and biblical context without explanation.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
