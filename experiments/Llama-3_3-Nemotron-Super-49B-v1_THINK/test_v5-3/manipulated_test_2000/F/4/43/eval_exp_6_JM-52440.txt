Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using specific labels for issues. First, I need to read the story carefully.

Starting with coherence. The text is a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure seems logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. The author sets up a clear objective: to examine if the Church teaches the Real Presence. They outline the points of contention (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) and proceed methodically. The transition between chapters is smooth, and each part builds on the previous. However, there's some repetition in emphasizing the need to rely on the Church's documents. Also, the text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about theological terms and Church documents, which might make it less clear for non-experts. But overall, the narrative is well-structured and coherent.

Now, fluency. The writing is formal and uses complex sentences, which is appropriate for the topic. Grammar and spelling seem correct. However, some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might hinder smooth reading. For example, the part in Chapter I where the author explains the Reformation principles has a jumbled sentence with repeated phrases ("the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone. That the..."). There's also a section with garbled text ("That the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual."). This looks like a formatting error or a missing part, causing confusion. Word choice is mostly precise, but the dense theological jargon could affect readability for some readers.

So for Coherence Score: The structure is clear, topics are well-connected, but some assumptions and minor repetitions. Maybe a 4.

For Fluency Score: Mostly good grammar and syntax, but some overly complex sentences and the garbled text. Maybe a 4 as well, but the error in the sentence might deduct a point. Wait, the garbled part is significant. If that's a typo or error, it's a major fluency issue. So maybe Fluency is 3?

Wait, the user provided the story as-is. The garbled text in Chapter I seems like a mistake in transcription. If that's part of the original, it's a big issue. But maybe it's a one-time error. Otherwise, the rest is fluent. So perhaps Fluency is 4 because the main issue is that one messed-up sentence and some long sentences, but overall correct.

Coherence: 4 (structured, clear progression, minor issues)
Fluency: 4 (mostly fluent, some complexity and one major error)

But wait, the evaluation criteria for Fluency include syntax, grammar, etc. The garbled sentence is a syntax and lexicon issue. So that's a significant problem. Maybe Fluency should be 3. Let me check again.

The garbled part: "That the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This seems like a corrupted sentence, possibly from a formatting error. If this is present in the original, it's a major fluency issue. However, the rest of the text is well-written. Since the task is to rate based on the given text, this error would affect the fluency score. So maybe Fluency is 3.

Coherence remains 4. So final scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 3.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Minor repetition in emphasizing reliance on Church documents; [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of theological terms/documents; [SYNTAX] One severely garbled sentence in Chapter I disrupting flow; [LEXICON] Overly complex sentence structures in some explanations.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
