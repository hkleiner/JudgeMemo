Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide issues in bullet points labeled with categories and scores from 1 to 5.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text appears to be an analysis or introduction to Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It's written in a somewhat formal, older style, possibly from the early 20th century given the references (e.g., Andrew Lang, mentions of 1869, 1870, 1887, 1905).

Starting with Fluency. The language is complex with long sentences and archaic terms (e.g., "hab nab at a venture," "gamin," "fiancée"). There are some grammatical issues, like missing articles or awkward phrasing. For example, "Except of rivals, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque as Nickleby merit his." This sentence is confusing and seems to have missing words or incorrect structure. Also, punctuation could be better; some commas are missing, and there are run-on sentences.

Now, Coherence. The structure is mostly logical, moving from discussing Dickens's later works to focusing on Edwin Drood. However, there are abrupt transitions, like jumping from analyzing characters to mentioning Andrew Lang's preface without clear connections. Some sections feel repetitive, such as repeated mentions of Jasper's opium use without immediate relevance. The Dramatis Personae section is detailed but disrupts the flow when inserted after the introduction. Also, the shift to "The Story" chapter feels a bit disconnected from the preceding analysis.

For issues under Fluency, I'll note [GRAMMAR] for the sentence structure problems, [LEXICON] for outdated vocabulary, and [SYNTAX] for awkward phrasing. Under Coherence, [STRUCTURE] for the disjointed chapters, [TRANSITION] for abrupt shifts, and [CLARITY] for confusing explanations.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3 because while there are errors, the text is mostly understandable. Coherence could be a 4 since the overall structure is logical but has some disruptions.

Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Complex, occasionally incoherent sentence structures (e.g., "Except of rivals, road such later stories..."). 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "hab nab at a venture," "gamin"). 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and missing articles ("a new series of Readings"). 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between analytical commentary and dramatic setup (e.g., "With this brief preface..."). 
- [TRANSITION] Disjointed shift from critique to *Dramatis Personæ* list. 
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, repetitive explanations of character motivations (Jasper’s opium use, Rosa’s emotions).

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
