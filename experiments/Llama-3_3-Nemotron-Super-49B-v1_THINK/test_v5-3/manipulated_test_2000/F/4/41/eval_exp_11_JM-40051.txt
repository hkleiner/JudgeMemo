Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide a score for each. First, I need to read through the story carefully and note any issues.

Starting with coherence. The story is about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location between La Crosse and Winona. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions. But I notice some jumps in the narrative. For example, the transition from discussing the Bible to the author's personal discovery feels abrupt. There's also repetition, like repeatedly stating the location's beauty without adding new information. The structure seems a bit disorganized, with ideas not flowing smoothly. Also, there's an assumption that the reader knows certain biblical details without explanation.

Now for fluency. Checking grammar, spelling, syntax. There are several typos: "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians", "locayion" instead of "location", "princopak" maybe "principal". Spelling mistakes like "admirirg", "dkscovered", "inhabitant" missing a space. Syntax issues, such as long, convoluted sentences that are hard to follow. Word choice could be better; some phrases are overly dramatic or redundant. Punctuation is mostly okay but could use improvement for clarity.

For coherence score, considering the structure and logic. The main point is clear, but the presentation is messy. Repetitions and lack of clear transitions deduct points. Maybe a 3?

Fluency, with all the errors, but the text is still understandable. The numerous typos and awkward phrasing bring it down. Maybe a 2 or 3? Since the errors are frequent but not crippling, perhaps 2.5, but since scores are integers, 2 or 3. Given the frequency, maybe 2.

Wait, let me check again. The fluency issues are significant: multiple spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, awkward sentences. So Fluency: 2. Coherence has structural issues but the overall narrative is somewhat held together, so Coherence: 3.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biblical context, personal discovery, and geographical details.
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repeated emphasis on location beauty without additive content.
- [CLARITY] Assumes biblical knowledge without explanation; vague connections between ideas.
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "locayion," "admirirg").
- [GRAMMAR] Convoluted sentence structures and missing punctuation.
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic or redundant phrasing (e.g., "veritable Garden of Eden" repeated).

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
