Okay, let me try to tackle this. So, I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, right? Let me start by reading through the story again to get a better grasp.

First, the story is divided into two chapters: "An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming". The first chapter talks about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, comparing him to European movements and highlighting his unique American style. The second chapter is a biographical account of Bradley's early life, from his childhood in Massachusetts to his job at a newspaper in Ishpeming, Michigan.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. Scanning through, I notice some typos. For example, "seem" should be "seen" in the first sentence. Then "toom" instead of "room", "werebknown" (maybe "were known"), "therecderivative" (should be "there were"), "esucation" (education), "qant" (want), "wzit" (wait), "prss" (press) multiple times, "boioer" (boiler), "towan" (town), "prdss" (press), "boardcand" (board and). These are clear spelling errors. Also, some punctuation issues, like missing commas or incorrect hyphenation. Syntax-wise, most sentences are structured okay, but a few are a bit long or awkward, like the part about the faker selling soap—it feels a bit abrupt. Lexicon is mostly good, with some vivid descriptions, but maybe "esquisite" should be "exquisite".

Now for Coherence. The introduction sets up Bradley's significance, then the second chapter delves into his childhood. The transition between chapters might feel a bit disconnected because the first part is analytical, and the second is narrative. Within each chapter, the ideas generally flow, but in "The Boy Printer", there are a lot of specific, detailed events that might make the narrative feel a bit fragmented. For example, the part about the faker at the end of chapter 2 doesn't seem to connect strongly to the rest of the story. Also, some parts repeat ideas, like mentioning his desire for an art education multiple times without much progression. The structure is mostly chronological, which is good, but the abrupt shift in topics (like the circus day or the faker) might disrupt smooth transitions.

So, for Fluency, the main issues are spelling and grammar errors, some syntax issues, and a few punctuation problems. That would deduct points. For Coherence, the main issues are the disconnect between chapters, some repetitive elements, and abrupt scene changes. But overall, the story has a clear structure and progresses logically within each chapter.

I think Fluency would be a 3 because there are noticeable errors but the text is still mostly understandable. Coherence might be a 4 since the overall narrative is clear, but there are some structural and transitional issues.

Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seem" → "seen", "toom" → "room", "werebknown", "prss", "boioer", "esucation", "qant", "wzit", "boardcand"). 
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation and verb tense consistency issues. 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between analytical (Chapter 1) and biographical (Chapter 2) sections. 
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected scenes (e.g., the faker subplot in Chapter 2 feels unresolved). 
- [REPEAT] Reiterated themes (e.g., art education desire) without clear progression.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
