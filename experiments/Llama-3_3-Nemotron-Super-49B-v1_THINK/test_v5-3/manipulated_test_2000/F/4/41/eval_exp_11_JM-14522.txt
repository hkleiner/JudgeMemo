Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency, using the given criteria. First, I need to read the story carefully and identify any issues.

Starting with fluency. The story is mostly smooth, but there are some typos and minor errors. For example, "seej" should be "seen", "bu tye" is probably "but the", "ofteb" might be "often", "xnd" could be "and", "Srripes" should be "Stripes", "vthe" is "with the", "tuey" is "they", "reavhed" is "reached", "Standint" is "Standing", "x earnest" maybe "at", "n" seems like a typo for a comma, "Yhe" should be "The", "evwrything" is "everything", "librwry" is "library", "Myerw" is "Myers". These are all spelling and grammar issues under [SPELLING] and [GRAMMAR]. 

For coherence, the structure is logical, each chapter builds on the previous. The transition between chapters is smooth. The story progresses from introduction to the ghost's appearance without abrupt jumps. The characters' reactions are consistentâ€”Americans being skeptical then encountering the ghost. However, there's a part where after the ghost appears, the family's discussion topics seem unrelated, but that's intentional to show they weren't expecting ghosts. Maybe a minor point on clarity if some transitions between paragraphs feel a bit quick, but overall coherent. 

So for Fluency, despite the typos, the language is mostly fluent. The errors are numerous but not crippling. Maybe a 4 because while there are issues, the overall flow isn't severely impacted.

For Coherence, the story holds together well. Each event leads to the next. The only possible issue is if the dialogue or scene changes feel a bit rushed, but it's a comedic piece so pacing is intentional. Score 5 for coherence as it's well-structured and logical.

Wait, but the user might expect higher sensitivity to the errors. Let me check again. The typos are frequent but not in critical areas affecting meaning much. Fluency is about smooth reading; the typos might make it a bit bumpy, so maybe a 3? But the original "Canterville Ghost" by Wilde has similar structure, so maybe the typos are the main fluency issue. Since the user's version has many typos, that's a big factor. So Fluency score 3 due to multiple spelling/grammar errors, but coherence remains 5 because the narrative is well-connected.

Issues: [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "bu tye", "ofteb", "xnd", "Srripes", "vthe", "tuey", "reavhed", "Standint", "Yhe", "evwrything", "librwry", "Myerw"). [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
