Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the style. There are some archaic spellings and words, like "unvommon" (probably "uncommon"), "best-establisjed" (best-established), "confidenve" (confidence), "isfmthey" (if they), "srrvice" (service), "businesbis" (business is), "tue" (the), "prssent" (present), "Vor" (1 Cor), "wnd" (and), "invisibly" repeated correctly but maybe considered archaic. These are typos or scanning errors. Also, sentence structure is complex and long, which might affect fluency. However, the grammar and syntax are mostly correct despite the errors. So Fluency issues are mainly spelling and some syntax due to length, but overall flow is okay once you adjust for the period.

For Coherence, the structure is clear: Introduction sets up the topic, then Chapter I dives into the Real Presence. The author outlines the controversy, presents different views (Rome vs. Church of England vs. Reformation), and then examines the Church's documents (Articles, etc.). The flow from introduction to analysis is logical. Each part connects to the next. However, there's some repetition in explaining the sacrament concept (e.g., comparing baptism and Lord's Supper), which might make it a bit lengthy. Also, the transition from discussing Scripture to moving into the Church documents could be smoother. But overall, the narrative is well-structured and easy to follow. The author's objective is clear, and the points are logically sequenced.

So for Issues under Fluency: Spelling mistakes, some syntactic complexity. Under Coherence: Minor repetition, slight transition issues. 

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because despite errors, it's mostly fluent. Coherence a 5 since structure is strong with minor flaws.

Issues: [SPELLING] Multiple archaic/erroneous spellings (e.g., "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "confidenve", "isfmthey", "srrvice", "businesbis", "tue", "prssent", "Vor", "wnd"). [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures. [LEXICON] Formal, archaic vocabulary.  
[STRUCTURE] Mild repetition in sacrament explanations. [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting from Scripture to Church documents.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
