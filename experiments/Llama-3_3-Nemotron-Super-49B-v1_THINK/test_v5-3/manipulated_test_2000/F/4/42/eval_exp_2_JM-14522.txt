Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues in both categories.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads—grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. Looking at the text, there are several grammatical errors. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." Then "when they come to discuss terms" should be "came." Also, "the ghost has am see" is incorrect; it should be "has been seen." There are multiple instances of incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement, like "Mr. Otis have telegraphed" instead of "had telegraphed." Spelling seems okay, but the syntax has some awkward phrasing, like "which he never ceased to regretted" (should be "regret"). Word choice is mostly good, but some phrases feel a bit forced or old-fashioned, which might be intentional given the parody style, but still affects fluency.

Now for coherence. The story structure is generally logical, following the Otis family moving in and encountering the ghost. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like the shift from the family's conversation topics to the ghost's appearance without much buildup. Also, the character reactions sometimes feel inconsistent—like Mr. Otis being too calm with the ghost, which might be humorous but could disrupt coherence for some readers. The narrative jumps between chapters without clear transitions, and some elements like the twins being called "The Star and Stripes" aren't fully integrated into the plot yet. The story relies on some convenient elements, like the stain reappearing magically, which might lack clear explanation.

Scoring: For Fluency, despite the many grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing, the overall flow isn't completely broken. Maybe a 3? For Coherence, the structure is mostly clear, but there are some jumps and inconsistencies. Maybe a 4 because the main plot flows well despite minor issues.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Multiple verb tense inconsistencies (e.g., "they come," "have fallen," "was removed"), subject-verb errors (e.g., "Mr. Otis have"), and incorrect verb forms (e.g., "regretted," "was removed"). [LEXICON] Archaic or forced phrasing (e.g., "swished," "am his only weaknesses"). [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter transition without narrative bridge. [LOGIC] Unexplained convenient plot elements (e.g., stain reappearing). [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in tone/dialogue (e.g., ghost encounter calmness).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
