Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency. First, I'll read through both chapters to understand the structure and any issues.

Starting with Fluency. Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon. In the first chapter, there are several errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "should have been." "realized" instead of "realize." "demolish" instead of "demolished." In the second chapter, "was know" should be "were known," "use to stamp" should be "used to stamp." Lots of subject-verb agreement issues like "the employees are all natives--... Most of the work is do by hand." Should be "done." "You was" repeatedly instead of "you were." These are clear grammar and spelling mistakes affecting fluency.

For Coherence, the structure seems mostly logical. The first chapter introduces Bradley's impact, the second chapter tells his childhood story. However, the transition between chapters might feel abrupt without a clear link. Also, in the second chapter, some scenes feel a bit disjointed, like the sudden mention of the faker selling soap without much buildup. The story jumps around his age and jobs quickly, which might confuse readers. But overall, the narrative follows a timeline, so coherence is decent but not perfect.

Scoring: Fluency gets a 3 because despite good phrasing and vocabulary, the numerous errors drag it down. Coherence is a 4 since the structure is mostly clear, but transitions and some jumps in the story deduct points.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb errors (e.g., "is know", "was"), incorrect verb forms (e.g., "shoulded", "donâ€™t worked"), inconsistent tense usage. [SPELLING] Errors like "demolish" (demolished), "realized" (realize). [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep"). [LEXICON] Repetitive vocabulary (e.g., "you was" instead of "you were"). [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear narrative link. [CLARITY] Minor ambiguities (e.g., unresolved faker subplot introduction).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
