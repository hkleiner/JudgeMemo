Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using specific labels for issues.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The author is arguing against the Real Presence doctrine, citing Church documents.

For Fluency, I should check grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Scanning the text, there are several grammatical errors. For example, "was" instead of "were" in "a blind consent is blindly give" â€“ that's a subject-verb agreement issue. Also, "the point was supposed to had been settle" should be "had been settled". There are inconsistencies in verb tenses, like "we are all agreed" followed by "I presume" which might be a bit abrupt but not a major error. Spelling seems okay, but word choice could be better in some places, like "sifting time" which is a bit archaic but understandable.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and a logical flow from introduction to examining specific articles. The author sets up a clear objective and follows through, comparing different doctrines. However, there's some repetition, especially in explaining the Reformation principles versus Rome's view. The transition between discussing Scripture and moving to Church documents is smooth, but the text is quite dense and assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the doctrines, which might make it less clear for non-experts. Also, the shift to talking about the Church's current state ("dear old Church") feels a bit abrupt and emotional, disrupting the otherwise formal tone.

So for Issues under Fluency, I'll list grammar errors, some syntax issues, and maybe lexicon for word choices. For Coherence, repetition, clarity (due to density and assumptions), and maybe structure for the emotional aside.

Scoring: Fluency has multiple grammar errors but overall the text is readable. Maybe a 3. Coherence is mostly logical but with some clarity issues and repetition, so maybe a 4.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "blind consent is blindly give", "the point was supposed to had been settle", "we was taught"), inconsistent tense usage (e.g., "was directed", "would be found"), and incorrect verb forms (e.g., "am examined", "was introduced"). [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("sifting time", "most earnest prayers") and overly formal tone. [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion").  
[COHERENCE] [CLARITY] Assumes specialized theological knowledge without explanation. [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift to emotional appeal ("That dear old Church") disrupting formal tone. [REPEAT] Repetitive explanations of doctrinal contrasts (Rome vs. Reformation).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
