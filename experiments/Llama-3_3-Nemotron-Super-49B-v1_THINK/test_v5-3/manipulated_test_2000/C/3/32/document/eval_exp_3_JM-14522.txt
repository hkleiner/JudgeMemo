Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the given criteria. First, I'll read through the story again to spot any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems mostly smooth, but there are some odd placeholders like "a thing" and "stuff" which are probably missing words. Those would affect LEXICON and maybe SYNTAX if they disrupt sentence structure. Also, some sentences are long and complex, which might impact readability, but overall grammar and spelling look okay.

For Coherence, the story flows logically from the introduction of the haunted house to the family's experiences. However, there's a jump from Chapter I to II without much transition. The events in Chapter II, like the repeated stain and the ghost encounter, are well-connected but maybe a bit abrupt. Also, some character introductions, like the twins being called "The Star and Stripes," feel a bit random without explanation.

Now, listing the issues. For Fluency, the main problems are the missing words ("a thing", "stuff") causing lexicon issues. Maybe some syntax issues if those placeholders mess up sentence flow. For Coherence, the lack of transition between chapters and some unclear character details (like the twins' nickname) could be points. Also, the sudden appearance of the twins with the pillow feels a bit out of nowhere.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because the placeholders are noticeable but the rest is fluent. Coherence could be a 4 too, since the overall structure is logical but has minor jumps and unclear elements.

Issues: [LEXICON] Missing/inconsistent placeholders ("a thing", "stuff") disrupt word choice; [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and II; [CLARITY] Unexplained character details (e.g., "The Star and Stripes" nickname); [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of ghost confrontation in Chapter II without buildup.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
