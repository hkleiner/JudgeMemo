Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate a given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to identify issues in the text under each category, label them, then assign scores.

Looking at the story, it's structured with two chapters: "An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming". The introduction talks about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, while the second chapter is a biographical sketch of his early life.

For Fluency, I need to check grammar, syntax, spelling, lexicton, etc. Scanning through, I notice some long sentences, like the one starting "He had this year..." which might affect readability. Also, in "The Boy Printer" chapter, there are abrupt shifts between different scenes in Bradley's childhood without clear transitions. For example, the switch from being at school to moving to Swampscott feels sudden. The use of quotes like “Yes, dear; but children grow very fast...” is good, but some paragraphs are dense and lack paragraph breaks, making the text blocky.

Now, Coherence. The introduction seems coherent on its own, discussing Bradley's contributions. However, the second chapter jumps into his childhood without a clear link to the first part. The story shifts from third person in the intro to a more personal, possibly first-person narrative in the second chapter, which might confuse readers. There's also a part in "The Boy Printer" that mentions "Sir Simon survived her nine years..." which seems out of context and unrelated to Bradley's story. That's a clear logic issue.

So, for Fluency issues: long sentences, lack of transitions, dense paragraphs. For Coherence: abrupt chapter transition, inconsistent narrative voice, unrelated content (Sir Simon part).

Scores: Fluency might be a 4 because while there are issues, the language is mostly clear. Coherence could be a 3 due to the structural and contextual problems between chapters and within the second chapter.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear thematic or narrative link; [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between scenes in "The Boy Printer" (e.g., shifts in location/time without signaling); [LOGIC] Unexplained, disconnected reference to "Sir Simon" in Chapter 2; [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "He had this year..."); [LEXICON] Archaic terms ("corn-fed," "lusty") may reduce accessibility for modern readers; [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs in Chapter 2 hindering readability.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
