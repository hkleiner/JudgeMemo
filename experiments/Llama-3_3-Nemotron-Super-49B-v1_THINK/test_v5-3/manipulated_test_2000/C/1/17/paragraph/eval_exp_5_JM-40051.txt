Okay, let me try to tackle this. So, the user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues.

Looking at the story, it starts with a title about the Garden of Eden and then dives into a historical/scientific discussion about locating Eden. The author talks about their discovery near the Mississippi River. Then, suddenly, there are paragraphs that seem completely out of placeâ€”like the part about Jasper and Rosa, which sounds like a romance novel, and then scenes with Mrs. Umney at Canterville Chase (which I recognize from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost"), followed by a office partition description, and then a part about George Stransom and Kate Creston. These sections don't relate to the Garden of Eden topic at all. 

For Coherence, the main issue is that the story jumps between completely unrelated narratives without any connection. The first part is about a geographical discovery, then there's a romantic subplot, a scene from a different story, an office setting, and another character drama. There's no logical flow or connection between these parts. The structure is disjointed, making the overall narrative confusing. The author's attempt to link the Garden of Eden with the Mississippi area is clear, but the inclusion of unrelated scenes breaks the coherence entirely.

For Fluency, the historical/scientific parts have some complex sentences and old-fashioned language (like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians"), but mostly the grammar and syntax are okay, though a bit archaic. However, the abrupt switches between different storylines cause fluency issues because the reader is jolted from one context to another without warning. There's also a possible typo in "admirirg" (should be "admiring") and "dimentions" (dimensions), but these are minor compared to the structural problems.

So, the main problems are under Coherence with [STRUCTURE] and [LOGIC] because the story lacks a unified narrative and has unrelated sections. For Fluency, the [STRUCTURE] and [TRANSITION] issues affect the smooth reading, but the language itself isn't too bad except for the jumps.

Scoring: Coherence would be very low, maybe 1, because the story falls apart with unrelated segments. Fluency might be a 2 because while individual sentences are mostly okay, the overall structure and transitions are terrible.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Completely unrelated narrative segments (Garden of Eden discovery, romantic subplot, Canterville Chase scene, office description, character drama) with no cohesive link.
- [LOGIC] Abrupt, unexplained transitions between disconnected storylines.
- [CLARITY] Confusing juxtaposition of historical, scientific, and fictional elements without contextual framing.
- [TRANSITION] No logical or thematic bridges between disparate scenes.

FINAL Coherence Score: 1  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
