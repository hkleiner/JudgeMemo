Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency, using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. 

Starting with fluency. The original "Canterville Ghost" by Wilde is known for its witty dialogue and smooth prose. But here, there are some anachronistic elements inserted, like a hologram displaying the weather, Bluetooth signal, surveillance camera. These are modern tech terms that stick out in a Victorian setting. That's a fluency issue under LEXICON or maybe SYNTAX because they disrupt the period's language. Also, check for grammar or spelling mistakes. I didn't notice any major errors there, so maybe the main fluency problem is the jarring tech references.

For coherence, the story mostly follows logically, but the sudden appearances of modern tech might disrupt the narrative flow. For example, the hologram and Bluetooth feel out of place. However, the overall structure of the chapters and the progression of events (buying the house, encountering the ghost) is coherent. The anachronisms might cause minor coherence issues because they don't fit the time period, creating slight confusion. But the main plot points connect well.

So, for issues: Under fluency, the anachronistic terms (hologram, Bluetooth, surveillance camera) would be [LEXICON] issues. For coherence, maybe [STRUCTURE] or [CLARITY] if those elements confuse the timeline or setting. But since the story still flows logically despite them, coherence might not be heavily penalized. 

Scoring: Fluency would be lower because those terms are noticeable errors in style. Maybe a 3? Coherence might be a 4 since the overall structure is good, but the anachronisms slightly affect clarity. Wait, but the user's example story has these modern elements intentionally? Or are they mistakes? Since the task is to rate as a human annotator, assuming these are errors in a supposedly period piece, they'd affect fluency more. 

Finalizing: Fluency issues with LEXICON, Coherence maybe a minor STRUCTURE or CLARITY, but since the story still makes sense, coherence score higher. So Fluency 3, Coherence 4.

Issues: 
- Anachronistic terms (hologram, Bluetooth signal, surveillance camera) disrupt period-appropriate language. [LEXICON]
- Sudden, unexplained modern elements slightly jar narrative cohesion. [STRUCTURE]

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
