Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale, and list the issues with bullet points labeled by category.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is quite long, so I'll have to skim but note any awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, or coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older time, maybe 19th century, given the style and references (like Galesville Independent, Dr. Warren). The language is formal but might have some archaic terms or sentence structures. I notice some possible typos: "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians," "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "Bridtish" (British), "consitutes" (constitutes). These are SPELLING issues. Also, some long, winding sentences might affect SYNTAX. For example, the sentence starting "When God made man..." is complex and hard to follow. Word choice like "dimentions" and "scientest" are LEXICON problems. Punctuation seems mostly okay but could be improved for clarity.

Now Coherence. The story jumps between biblical references, personal discovery, and geographical descriptions. The author assumes the reader knows certain biblical details without explanation. There's repetition, like emphasizing the garden's location multiple times. The transition between talking about the garden's features and suddenly mentioning snakes feels abrupt (STRUCTURE). The logic in connecting the Mississippi to the Euphrates seems a stretch (LOGIC). The narrative isn't tightly structured; it meanders between different points. Also, some parts are unclear, like how the author concludes it's Eden without strong evidence (CLARITY).

For scores: Fluency has several errors but the text is mostly understandable. Maybe a 3. Coherence is weaker due to jumps, assumptions, and lack of clear structure. Maybe a 2.

Wait, let me check again. Fluency: despite errors, the flow isn't too bad. Maybe 3 is right. Coherence: the story lacks a clear progression, repeats ideas, and has logical leaps. Definitely a 2.

Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "scientest," "Bridtish," "consitutes").
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man...").
- [LEXICON] Archaic or inconsistent word choices (e.g., "dimentions").
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., introduction of snakes without context).
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims linking the Mississippi to Edenâ€™s biblical description.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about reader familiarity with biblical geography.
- [REPETITIVENESS] Reiterated location details without added clarity.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
