Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully and assess both fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. I notice several grammatical errors, like "was" instead of "were" in places, incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "was blindly give"), and some awkward phrasing. For example, "the point was supposed to had been settle" should be "had been settled." These errors are frequent enough to cause some disruption but not so severe that the text is unintelligible. The structure of sentences is mostly clear, though some are quite long and complex. Despite the errors, the overall meaning is understandable with some effort. So for fluency, I'd rate it a 3.5 because while there are multiple issues, they don't completely hinder understanding.

Now for coherence. The text is well-structured, with clear chapters and a logical progression from introduction to examining specific doctrines. The author sets out a clear objective and methodically approaches the topic by referencing church documents. Transitions between ideas are generally smooth, and the arguments are logically connected. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like the mention of the Church of England's current state without clear connection to the preceding discussion. Also, some paragraphs are lengthy and dense, which might make following the argument slightly challenging. But overall, the coherence is good, with only minor lapses. So coherence would be a 4 because it's mostly coherent with a few weak points.

Wait, but let me check again. The author clearly outlines the structure (e.g., investigating three points), uses transitional phrases, and maintains a consistent argumentative flow. The only issues are minor, like the abrupt mention of the Church's situation, but it doesn't disrupt the overall logic. So maybe coherence is a 4.5? Hmm, but the criteria for 4.5 isn't mentioned; the scale goes up to 5. Wait, the scale for coherence says 5 is highly coherent with minor lapses barely noticeable. Since there are a couple of minor issues but overall very logical, maybe 4.5 isn't an option since the allowed scores are in half-points. Wait, the user said half-points are allowed, so 4.5 is possible. But the example labels for coherence include STRUCTURE, LOGIC, etc. The main issue here is minor, so perhaps 4.5 is appropriate. But I need to check the scale again. 

Coherence scale: 5 is highly coherent with minor lapses not hindering understanding. 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The text here has a clear structure, logical flow, and only minor issues like one abrupt transition. So maybe 4.5 is correct because it's very coherent with just a slight weakness. But the user's scale allows half-points, so 4.5 is possible. However, looking back, the main issue in coherence was the transition in one part and some dense paragraphs, but overall very well-connected. So perhaps 4.5 for coherence and 3.5 for fluency.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "was blindly give," "they only am") and incorrect past participles ("had been settle"). - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "the point was supposed to had been settle").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] One abrupt transition (e.g., shift to the Churchâ€™s current state without clear connection). - [CLARITY] Dense, overly lengthy paragraphs slightly hindering readability.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
