Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, so I expect some archaic language, but maybe some intentional style. However, the user-provided text has lots of grammatical errors. Let me list them:

1. "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him" [GRAMMAR]
2. "when they come to discuss terms" → "came" [GRAMMAR]
