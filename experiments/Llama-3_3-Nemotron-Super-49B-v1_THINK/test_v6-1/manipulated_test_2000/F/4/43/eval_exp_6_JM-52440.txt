Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence using the provided scales. Each has specific criteria.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the style. The language is formal, complex. Let me check for grammar, syntax, lexicon, etc. The sentences are long and structured with proper punctuation. I notice some archaic words like "thou" or "whilst," but that's expected. Wait, looking closer, there's a part in Chapter I where the text seems garbled: "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This looks like a formatting error or a typo. That's a clear syntax and lexicon issue. Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might affect readability, but the structure is mostly correct. So Fluency issues would be [SYNTAX] and [LEXICON] due to that garbled part and possibly some complex sentences, but overall it's well-structured. Maybe a score of 4 because the main issue is that one messed-up section, but the rest is fluent.

Now Coherence. The text is structured with chapters and clear topics. The introduction sets up the argument, then each chapter addresses a point. The author connects ideas logically, referencing scriptures and church documents. However, there's a lot of repetition in explaining the two viewpoints (Real Presence vs Reformation principles). The transition between discussing Scripture and moving to Church documents is clear. But the dense theological jargon might make it hard for non-experts to follow, affecting clarity. Also, the part where the author says they won't use collateral writers but then dives into Articles might slightly disrupt flow, but it's intentional. So Coherence issues could be [CLARITY] due to jargon and [STRUCTURE] for minor transitions, but overall coherent. Score might be 4 as well, since it's mostly logical but has some dense sections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Garbled, incoherent sentence structure in Chapter I (e.g., "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou," "whilst") may impede modern readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [CLARITY] Dense theological jargon and abstract concepts (e.g., "real objective presence") reduce accessibility.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor abrupt shifts (e.g., transitioning from Scripture to Church documents without clear markers).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
