Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly formal and well-structured. The sentences are complex but generally clear. However, there are some long, convoluted sentences that might cause minor readability issues. For example, the part about Princess Puffer's timeline and Jasper's age has a lot packed in, which could confuse some readers. Also, terms like "gamin" or "roman policier" might require some knowledge, but they're not errors, just specialized vocabulary. I didn't spot any major grammar or spelling mistakes, so Fluency is probably high, maybe a 4.5. The only deductions are for a few overly complex sentences.

Now, Coherence. The structure is logical, moving from introduction to character analysis to plot points. Transitions between sections seem smooth. However, there are abrupt shifts, like the sudden mention of "The Signalman" without clear connection, or the cut-off sentence "An livestream began recording." That last part looks like an error or incomplete sentence, disrupting coherence. Also, some character relationships (like Princess Puffer possibly being Jasper's mother) are introduced without full explanation, which might confuse readers. Despite this, the overall flow is maintained, so Coherence might be a 4, deducting for those abrupt points and unclear connections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses about character timelines).  
- [LEXICON] Specialized terms (e.g., "roman policier," "gamin") may require domain knowledge.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt unresolved shifts (e.g., "An livestream began recording" appears incomplete).  
- [CLARITY] Unexplained connections (e.g., Princess Pufferâ€™s potential relationship to Jasper).  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden references (e.g., "The Signalman") without contextual integration.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
