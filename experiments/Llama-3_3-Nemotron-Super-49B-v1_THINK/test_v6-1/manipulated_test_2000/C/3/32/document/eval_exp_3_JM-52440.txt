Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on fluency and coherence separately.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. There are long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the first paragraph has sentences that are quite long and packed with ideas. While the grammar seems mostly correct, the phrasing might be considered awkward by today's standards. There's no obvious spelling or syntax errors, but the verbosity and outdated structure could affect readability. So, the main fluency issue is [SYNTAX] due to overly complex sentence structures that might hinder flow.

Now, coherence. The text is structured with chapters and clear topics. The author outlines the objective in the introduction and proceeds methodically through points. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, moving from discussing the Church of England's situation to examining the Articles feels a bit abrupt without a clearer link. Also, some paragraphs are very long and dense, making the logical flow less obvious. The coherence is generally good but has minor disconnects, so the issue here is [STRUCTURE] with some abrupt transitions and overly lengthy paragraphs disrupting the flow slightly.

Scoring: Fluency is mostly good but with notable syntactic complexity, so maybe a 4. Coherence is strong but with minor structural issues, so a 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures hindering modern readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Occasional abrupt transitions between paragraphs; dense, lengthy paragraphs disrupt flow.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
