Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is a historical theological discussion from the Church of England, specifically about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The user wants me to rate Fluency and Coherence using the given criteria.

First, Fluency. The text is formal, written in an older style (probably 19th century). The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I need to check for grammatical errors, syntax issues, or awkward phrasing. Scanning through, the structure is mostly clear, but the verbosity and archaic language (e.g., "a thing" likely a typo for "the Church") could cause difficulties. However, there are no obvious grammatical errors; the syntax is mostly correct despite being complex. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 4.5, because while it's challenging due to style and length, it's still understandable with effort.

Next, Coherence. The text is well-structured with clear chapters and topics (Introduction, Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author logically connects ideas, contrasting Church of England teachings with Roman Catholic views. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth. However, the dense theological jargon and lengthy explanations might make it hard for non-specialists to follow. There's a clear logical progression, so Coherence is likely high, maybe 4 or 5. But the complexity and assumed knowledge could deduct a point, making it a 4.

Wait, but the criteria for Coherence 5 requires "clear and logical progression" with "minor lapses" not hindering understanding. The text's complexity and length might lead to some confusion, but the structure is strong. Maybe a 4.5 for Coherence because while well-organized, the depth and terminology require close attention.

For Fluency, despite the formal and somewhat outdated language, there's no mentioned error in grammar or spelling. The main issue is the style making it less fluent for modern readers, but according to the scale, Fluency 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." Since the issues are more about style than errors, maybe 4.5? But the user's text has "a thing" which seems like a typo (should be "Church"). If that's an error, it affects Fluency. Wait, the original text provided by the user has "a thing" in several places, which is clearly a placeholder or error. That would be a significant issue under Fluency, specifically [SPELLING] or [LEXICON] if it's a consistent typo. However, the user might have intended "the Church" there. If "a thing" is intentional, it's confusing, but if it's a typo, that's a problem. Assuming it's a typo, that's a clear error affecting Fluency. So Fluency score would drop. For example, in "seven Articles—xxv. to a thing more or less upon the subject;" — "a thing" doesn't make sense; should be "the Church". Multiple instances like this would lead to deductions. So Fluency issues: [SPELLING/TYPO] repeated errors like "a thing" instead of "the Church". That would make Fluency score lower, maybe 3.5, because those errors disrupt understanding. But wait, the user's instruction says the text is given as-is, so if "a thing" is present, it's part of the text to evaluate. So yes, those are errors. Hence, Fluency Issues would include [SPELLING] for "a thing" typos, and possibly [CLARITY] due to archaic language, but the main problem is the typos. 

Coherence: The structure is clear, but the frequent use of "a thing" (if unresolved) could cause confusion. However, assuming the reader infers "the Church", the logical flow is maintained. So Coherence might still be high, but the typos could slightly affect it under [CLARITY], but since Coherence is about overall structure and logic, maybe not heavily. So Coherence score 4.5, Fluency 3.5 due to the typos and style.

Wait, but the Fluency scale: Score 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues." If "a thing" is a repeated typo, that's multiple errors. So Fluency would be 3. However, the rest of the text is well-structured grammatically. So maybe 3.5, considering both the errors and the overall fluency otherwise.

Finalizing: Fluency has [SPELLING] issues with "a thing" and possibly [CLARITY] from archaic language, but the main problem is the typos. Coherence has good structure but maybe [CLARITY] from complexity. So Fluency: 3.5, Coherence: 4.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Repeated typos (e.g., "a thing" instead of "the Church") - [CLARITY] Archaic vocabulary and overly complex sentence structures  
2) Coherence Issues: - [CLARITY] Dense theological terminology and assumptions of prior knowledge  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
