Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the specified criteria.

First, Fluency. The text is a historical theological treatise, probably from the 19th century given the style and references (e.g., Dr. Pusey, Church of England documents from the 1500s). The language is formal, complex, with long sentences and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "verily"). 

Checking for Fluency issues: 
- **Grammar**: The text uses correct grammar for its time. No obvious errors, but some constructions are outdated.
- **Spelling**: Assuming it's a scan or transcription, there might be minor typos, but none mentioned here.
- **Syntax**: Complex, lengthy sentences might impede flow but are structurally correct.
- **Lexicon**: Archaisms and theological jargon could make it less accessible but are appropriate for the context.

Coherence:
- The text is structured with chapters and clear topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each section analyzes Church of England documents methodically.
- **Logic**: Arguments are well-supported with references to Articles, Catechism, etc. Contrasting views are addressed logically.
- **Structure**: Clear progression from introduction to examination of each point.
- **Clarity/Transitions**: Despite complexity, transitions between ideas are mostly smooth, though some paragraphs are very long.

Potential issues:
- **Coherence**: The dense, repetitive argumentation might make it hard to follow for non-experts, but within the genre, it's coherent.
- **Fluency**: The antiquated style and length of sentences affect readability, but not clarity per se.

Scores:
- **Fluency**: 4. The text is mostly fluent but has minor issues from outdated language and complexity. No major errors, so 4 seems right.
- **Coherence**: 5. Highly coherent with a logical structure and clear connections between ideas, despite density.

Now, formatting the answer as required.
