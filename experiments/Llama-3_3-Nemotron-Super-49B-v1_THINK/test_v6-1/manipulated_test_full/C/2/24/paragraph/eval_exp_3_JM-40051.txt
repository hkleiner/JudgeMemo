Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as defined. 

Starting with Fluency: It's about individual sentence qualityâ€”grammar, repetition, clarity. The scale goes from 5 (highly fluent) to 1 (unintelligible). The text provided is quite long and written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. I notice some grammatical issues, like missing articles ("a" before "missionary"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (dimensions), "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "enviable" (envious?), "misdemeanor" (maybe meant "misdeed"?), "falsely" (possibly "falsely" is correct, but context matters). Also, there are repetitive phrases ("Come and see!") and long, convoluted sentences that make it hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting "When God formed the earth..." is very long and complex. 

For Coherence: It's about the overall structure, logical flow, and connectivity. Score 5 is highly coherent, 1 is incoherent. The text jumps between biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions. The author assumes a lot of background knowledge (e.g., references to Dr. Warren, Engel's book) without explanation. There's a lack of a clear thesis beyond claiming the location is Eden, and the structure is disjointed with abrupt shifts (e.g., from scenery to geology to dairy products). 

Now, breaking down the issues:

Fluency Issues:
- **GRAMMAR**: Multiple grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "enviable" instead of "envious", missing articles).
- **SYNTAX**: Overly complex, long sentences hindering clarity.
- **REPEITITIVENESS**: Repeated phrases like "Come and see!" without variation.
- **LEXICON**: Archaic vocabulary and some unclear terms.

Coherence Issues:
- **LOGIC**: Assumes knowledge without explanation (e.g., Dr. Warren's work).
- **STRUCTURE**: Lack of clear organization; abrupt topic changes.
- **CLARITY**: Overly descriptive without a focused argument.
- **TRANSITION**: Poor connections between paragraphs.

Scoring:
Fluency: The text is mostly readable but has frequent errors and awkwardness. Maybe a 3? Because while you can understand it, the issues are noticeable and interrupt flow.

Coherence: The text is generally coherent in parts but has significant structural and logical flaws. Maybe a 2.5? It's hard to follow overall, with many inconsistencies.

Wait, but the Fluency scale says 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues interrupting flow". Yes, that fits. Coherence scale 2.5 is "frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, difficult to follow". That also fits.

So final scores: Fluency 3, Coherence 2.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", missing articles).  
   - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures.  
   - [REPEITITIVENESS] Repeated phrases (e.g., "Come and see!").  
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and unclear terms.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Unexplained assumptions (e.g., references to Dr. Warren, Engel).  
   - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed, lacking clear organization.  
   - [CLARITY] Excessive description without focused argument.  
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., geography to dairy statistics).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
