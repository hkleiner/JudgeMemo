Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria. Each metric has a scale from 1 to 5 with half-points allowed. I have to list the most serious issues for each, label them, and then assign scores.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, probably from the 19th century given the style and references (like Dr. Pusey and historical events). The language is complex with long sentences. Let me check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. 

Looking through the text, I notice very long, convoluted sentences. For example, the first paragraph has sentences that are multiple clauses long. This could affect readability. There are also archaic terms like "thou" and "thee" in quoted prayers, but those might be intentional as part of historical documents. 

Checking for grammar errors: I see "we was taught" instead of "we were taught." That's a subject-verb agreement mistake. Also, "it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion" â€“ maybe "consist of" instead of "in"? Not sure if that's an error or just old usage. 

Spelling seems okay, but there's "was" used incorrectly in places, like "the water was sanctify" should be "was sanctified." Also, "adore (for that were idolatry)" missing a verb tense consistency maybe. 

Syntax-wise, the structure is mostly clear but very dense. The author uses complex structures, which might make it hard to follow without concentration. 

For Coherence, the text is well-structured with clear chapters and topics. The author argues a point by referencing church documents in a logical order. However, the density and length of explanations might cause coherence issues. Transitions between ideas are generally clear, but the extensive use of quotes and historical references could disrupt flow for some readers. 

The main points are well-connected, but the text assumes a lot of background knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and historical context. This might make it less clear to readers without that background. 

Now, summarizing the issues. For Fluency, the main problems are grammatical errors (like "we was"), archaic language affecting modern readability, and overly complex sentence structures. For Coherence, the assumptions of prior knowledge and the dense, lengthy explanations could reduce clarity. 

Scoring: Fluency has some errors but is mostly readable with effort. Maybe a 3.5? Coherence is generally good but has some obstacles, so maybe 4? 

Wait, let me check the scales again. Fluency scale: 5 is highly fluent with minimal errors. This text has noticeable errors and complexity, so maybe 3.5. Coherence: 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The text's coherence is strong in structure but weakened by density and assumptions, so 4 seems right.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "we was taught") and inconsistent tense usage.  
   - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "thou," "thee") reducing modern readability.  
   - [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences impairing clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Assumes extensive background knowledge of Church of England history/doctrine without explanation.  
   - [CLARITY] Overly dense, lengthy explanations and quotes disrupting flow for non-specialists.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
