Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on Fluency and Coherence. Let's start with Fluency. The text is quite long and written in an old style, probably from the 19th century. The author uses complex sentences and archaic vocabulary like "antldiluvians" (which should be antediluvians) and "minds of some". There are some grammatical errors, like "admirirg" instead of "admiring", and "commenced developing the facts about it" could be more smoothly phrased. The structure of sentences is mostly clear, but there's repetition, such as frequent exclamations and the repeated "Come and see!" which might make it a bit tedious. The language is formal but has some awkward phrasing, like "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat".

Now for Coherence. The text jumps between describing the location of the Garden of Eden, biblical references, geographical details, and personal anecdotes. There's a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs; for example, the shift from talking about the garden's features to discussing Dr. Warren's theory feels abrupt. The author assumes the reader is familiar with certain biblical and geographical contexts without sufficient explanation. Despite this, the overall argument is clearâ€”the author believes they've found the Garden of Eden in a specific location. However, the structure is somewhat disorganized, with multiple tangents (like the story about the lawyer and the devil) that don't strongly support the main claim.

For Fluency score: There are noticeable grammatical and spelling issues, but the text is mostly readable. The errors and awkwardness deduct from fluency but don't make it unintelligible. So maybe a 3.5?

For Coherence score: The text has some coherence in its central argument, but the organization is poor with abrupt shifts and tangents. It's generally followable but with significant disruptions. Maybe a 3?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Sporadic grammatical errors (e.g., "admirirg," "commenced developing")  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and awkward phrasing (e.g., "antldiluvians," "plat")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures and repetition ("Come and see!")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., biblical references, personal anecdotes)  
- [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of biblical/geographical context without explanation  
- [TRANSITION] Tangents (e.g., lawyer anecdote, geological age discussion) disrupt flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
