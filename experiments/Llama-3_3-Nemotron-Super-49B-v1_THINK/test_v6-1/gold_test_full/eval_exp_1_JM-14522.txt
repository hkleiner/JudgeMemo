Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text provided is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I need to assess Fluency and Coherence.

First, Fluency. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, phrasing, clarity. The text is a classic, so I expect high fluency. But I should check for any issues. The language is formal, Victorian style, which might have some archaic expressions but that's intentional. I didn't notice grammatical errors. The sentences are complex but structured well. Maybe some long sentences, but they're clear. So Fluency score is probably 5.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about the text as a whole—logical flow, connections between ideas. The story has chapters, each advancing the plot logically. The ghost's attempts and the family's reactions are well-linked. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistent. The ending with Virginia's empathy and the ghost's redemption ties everything together. No major gaps or confusing shifts. So Coherence score is also 5.

Wait, but are there any minor issues? Maybe in some transitions between chapters, but they seem smooth. The character developments are consistent. I think both metrics are at the highest score.
