Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the fluency and coherence of the given text based on the criteria provided.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the style and vocabulary. The sentences are long and complex, which might make them a bit hard to follow, but they're structured properly. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon issues. I notice words like "whosoever" and "thou" which are archaic but correct in their context. There's no obvious spelling mistakes. The structure is formal and consistent. Maybe some repetitive phrases, like "I am not now discussing..." but that's part of the rhetorical style. So fluency is high, maybe a 4.5 because while it's very fluent, the antiquated language and long sentences might cause minor slowdowns for modern readers.

Now Coherence. The text is well-organized, starting with an introduction, then chapter divisions. The author clearly states the objective and outlines the structure. Transitions between ideas are smooth, using phrases like "Thus far, I presume..." and "In doing this, our first business...". The arguments are logically connected, comparing different doctrines and citing church documents. There's a clear progression from stating the problem to analyzing the Church of England's teachings. I don't see abrupt shifts or confusing segments. The only possible issue might be the density of the content, requiring close attention, but that's not a coherence problem per se. So coherence score would be 5, as it's highly coherent with a logical structure and smooth connections.

Wait, but in the introduction, there's a mention of the Church's situation with some endeavouring to destroy or corrupt it. That's a bit of a tangent but quickly tied back to the need to examine the Church's own documents. Doesn't disrupt coherence. So yes, coherence is strong.

Finalizing scores: Fluency 4.5 due to minor challenges from style but no errors. Coherence 5 because it's well-structured and logically sound.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whosoever," "thou") and overly complex sentence structures may impede modern readability.  
   - [STRUCTURE] Occasionally repetitive transitional phrases (e.g., "I am not now discussing").  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor tangential remarks (e.g., "some endeavouring to destroy it") briefly divert focus but are quickly resolved.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
