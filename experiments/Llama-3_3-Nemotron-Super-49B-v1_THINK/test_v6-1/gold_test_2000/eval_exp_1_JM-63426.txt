Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through both chapters carefully to identify any fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written with good phrasing. However, in the first chapter, there's a sentence: "the impact of his work on his time." That feels a bit awkward; maybe "his time" is unclear. Should it be "his contemporaries" or "the time period"? Also, in the second chapter, there are some long, descriptive paragraphs without clear transitions. For example, the shift from talking about the printing press to going to Fishermanâ€™s Beach might be abrupt. 

For Coherence, the first chapter connects well, discussing Bradley's influence. The second chapter is more biographical but has some disjointed scenes. Like, the part about the circus day and wanting to join feels a bit out of place without a clear connection to his printing career. Also, the transition from being in school to asking to work feels sudden. 

Now, labeling these issues. For Fluency, the unclear phrase could be [LEXICON] and the long paragraphs [STRUCTURE] under Fluency's syntax maybe? Wait, Fluency is about individual sentences. Maybe the long paragraphs affect Fluency's clarity, so [CLARITY] under Coherence? Hmm, no. Coherence deals with overall structure. Wait, Fluency's structure refers to sentence structure. So maybe the long paragraphs are a Coherence issue under [STRUCTURE]. 

For Coherence, the abrupt shifts in the second chapter would be [TRANSITION] issues. The circus part might be [LOGIC] if it's irrelevant. 

Scoring: Fluency is mostly good, a few minor issues, so maybe 4.5? Coherence has more issues, especially in the second chapter, so maybe 4?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing ("impact of his work on his time")  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally wordy sentences (e.g., "It is your first day...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between scenes (e.g., circus day to art ambitions)  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly fragmented biographical anecdotes in Chapter 2  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
