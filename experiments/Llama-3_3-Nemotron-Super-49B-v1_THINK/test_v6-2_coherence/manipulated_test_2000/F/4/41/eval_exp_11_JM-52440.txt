Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the specified criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any coherence issues.

Starting with the introduction, the text discusses the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author criticizes confident assertions without proof and states the objective is to examine the Church's documents. The structure here seems logical, moving from problem statement to methodology. 

In Chapter I, the text delves into the Real Presence, citing Scripture and comparing Roman Catholic and Church of England views. The author then outlines the Reformation perspective, emphasizing no change in elements and spiritual feeding by faith. The discussion here is detailed but might be dense for some readers. There's a clear contrast between views, but transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the shift from explaining Roman views to Reformation views is abrupt without a connecting sentence.

The author then examines the Articles of the Church, specifically Article 25 on sacraments. They analyze how sacraments are signs accompanied by invisible grace, not changed into the thing signified. The comparison with baptism in Article 27 reinforces this point. The logic here is strong, using the Church's own documents to argue against Real Presence. However, the repeated emphasis on the distinction between sign and gift might feel repetitive without clearer transitions between paragraphs.

Potential issues: 
1. **TRANSITION** between paragraphs in Chapter I could be better. The text jumps from Scripture to doctrinal comparisons without clear links.
2. **CLARITY** in explaining complex theological concepts might confuse readers not familiar with the terms.
3. **STRUCTURE** in the Article analysis is logical but repetitive, which could disrupt flow.

Most serious problems are the abrupt transitions and potential clarity issues for unfamiliar readers. The text is generally coherent with a logical structure, but these flaws deduct points. Score would be 4, as it's mostly coherent with minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between explaining theological views (e.g., Roman vs. Reformation perspectives) and analyzing Church documents without clear connective language.  
- [CLARITY] Dense, complex theological distinctions (e.g., "spiritual food" vs. "material food") assume prior knowledge, potentially confusing unfamiliar readers.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on "sign vs. gift" in sacrament analysis, disrupting flow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
