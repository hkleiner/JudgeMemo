Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long, so I need to read through it carefully and identify coherence issues. 

First, coherence is about how well the text holds together logically and structurally. The author is trying to argue that a specific location near the Mississippi River is the Garden of Eden. 

Looking at the structure: The text starts with an introduction about the discovery, then dives into biblical references and geographical descriptions. There are multiple sections, each focusing on different aspects like river layouts, the hanging garden, and comparisons to the Bible. 

Possible issues: Transitions between paragraphs might be abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing the author's initial skepticism to biblical quotes about rivers feels a bit disconnected. Also, the text jumps between describing the landscape and addressing critics or making claims about the location's suitability. 

There's repetition, like mentioning the Mississippi as the Euphrates multiple times without clear progression. Some sentences are long and convoluted, affecting clarity. For instance, the part about the river banks and bluffs has complex descriptions that might confuse readers. 

The author assumes knowledge, like referencing "Havilah" without explanation. There's also a mix of personal anecdotes (killing snakes) with broader geological claims, which might disrupt the flow. 

Despite these, the overall argument is mostly followed, even if the execution is clumsy. The text isn't completely incoherent, but there are noticeable issues. 

Rating: Considering the scale, a 3 seems right. The text has noticeable problems but isn't impossible to follow. The main issues are structural jumps, lack of clear transitions, and some unclear explanations.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biblical interpretations, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes (e.g., shift from snake stories to landscape praise).  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex, repetitive sentence structures (e.g., "The river here... has three banks...").  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of logical connectors between paragraphs (e.g., jump from criticizing greed in Trempealeau’s proprietors to describing the garden’s beauty).  
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated assumptions (e.g., equating the Mississippi to the Euphrates without clear justification).  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
