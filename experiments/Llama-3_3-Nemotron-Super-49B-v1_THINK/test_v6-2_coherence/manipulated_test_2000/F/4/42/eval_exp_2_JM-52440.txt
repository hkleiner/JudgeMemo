Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any coherence issues. 

Starting with the introduction, the text seems well-structured, introducing the topic and the author's objective. The chapters are clearly marked, which helps with structure. The author discusses the Doctrine of the Real Presence and contrasts it with the Church of England's teachings, referencing specific articles and scriptures. 

Looking for coherence problems: The text is quite formal and dense, which might affect clarity, but the logical flow seems mostly intact. However, there are some grammatical errors like "was" instead of "were" or incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "was directed", "was examined"). These don't disrupt understanding much but are noticeable.

The structure is mostly logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but some paragraphs are very long, which might make following the argument harder. For example, in Chapter I, the explanation of the Real Presence and the contrast with Reformation principles is detailed but could be broken up for better flow.

The author uses terms like "real objective presence" and explains them, which is good for clarity. However, the frequent switching between discussing Scripture, Church doctrines, and personal beliefs might confuse some readers without clear transitions. 

The main issues I see are the grammatical inconsistencies, overly long paragraphs, and some abrupt shifts in focus (like moving from theological discussion to the Church's current state without a clear link). These contribute to a slight disjointedness but don't completely disrupt coherence. 

According to the criteria, a score of 4 indicates mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The text's strengths in structure and logical progression outweigh the minor issues, so I'd rate it a 4.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly long paragraphs hinder readability and flow.  
- [CLARITY] Grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., "was directed," "was examined") distract slightly.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between theological concepts and institutional critique (e.g., "That dear old Church...").  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.0**
