Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text and provide a score with bullet points on the main issues.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. The text is quite long and seems to be an old-style writing, possibly from the 19th century given the language and references. The author is claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location along the Mississippi River.

Looking at coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically, transitions are smooth, and the structure makes sense. 

Starting with the structure: The text starts with an introduction about the discovery, then moves into biblical context, the author's personal experience, geographical descriptions, and ends with a vivid description of the location. The transitions between these sections might be abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing biblical descriptions to the author's personal impressions on the location feels a bit disconnected. There's no clear paragraph breaks in the provided text, which could affect readability and coherence.

Clarity is another aspect. Some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the part about the river banks and the description of the hanging garden has complex sentences that might confuse readers. Also, there are what looks like typos or incomplete sentences, like "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to..." which seems garbled and disrupts understanding.

Logic: The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's location based on biblical interpretations and personal observations, but the connections between these points aren't always clear. For example, linking the Mississippi to the Euphrates because of the name's euphony might not be logically sound. There's also a mix of religious, scientific, and personal anecdotal evidence without a clear logical flow.

Transitions: The text jumps between different ideas— từ biblical history to personal anecdotes, then to geographical details, and back to biblical references. These jumps aren't smoothed out with transitional phrases, making the text feel disjointed.

The most serious issues would be the lack of clear structure, poor transitions, and unclear or overly complex sentences. Despite the overall theme being consistent (proving the Garden's location), the execution lacks coherence in presentation.

Scoring: The text has noticeable problems but isn't completely incoherent. It's more than just a few weak parts (which would be a 4), but the disruptions are significant. A score of 3 seems right because while you can follow the main argument, the numerous issues with structure, clarity, and transitions make it hard to follow without effort.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Excessively long, convoluted sentences (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...") and unclear phrasing (e.g., "possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the...").  
- [LOGIC] Overreliance on euphony (e.g., Mississippi = Euphrates) and unexplained leaps (e.g., linking rattlesnakes to biblical symbolism).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of paragraph-level organization and bridging language between ideas.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
