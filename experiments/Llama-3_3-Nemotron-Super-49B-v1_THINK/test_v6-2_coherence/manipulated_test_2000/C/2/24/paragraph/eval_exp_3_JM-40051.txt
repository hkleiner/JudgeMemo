Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long and dense, so I need to break it down.

First, coherence. The author is arguing that a specific location between La Crosse, WI, and Winona, MN, is the Garden of Eden. The structure starts with an introduction about the discovery, then delves into biblical references and geographical descriptions. 

Looking for coherence issues: The text jumps between different topics. For example, after discussing the biblical rivers, it suddenly talks about the town of Trempealeau's history and then switches to describing the landscape and snakes. These transitions feel abrupt. There's also repetition, like repeatedly stating the location's beauty without clear connections to previous points. 

The logic sometimes stretches, like assuming the absence of mineral wealth is a pro because it prevents corruption. That feels like a weak argument. Also, the author uses names like "Euphrates" for the Mississippi without clear justification beyond euphony. 

Structure-wise, the text meanders. It starts personally, moves to biblical analysis, then geography, history of the town, and back to description. Each section doesn't flow smoothly into the next. There's no clear outline guiding the reader. 

Clarity is an issue too. Some sentences are overly complex or vague. For instance, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'" is unclear. Also, terms like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians) might confuse readers. 

Transitions are poor. The shift from talking about the garden's features to mentioning snakes and then Christian settlement feels disconnected. The text could benefit from clearer links between paragraphs.

Despite these, the overall idea is somewhat followed, but the execution lacks coherence in structure, transitions, and logical connections. The most serious problems are the abrupt shifts in topic (STRUCTURE), lack of clear transitions (TRANSITION), and some logical leaps (LOGIC). 

Scoring: A 3 seems right because while there's a central argument, the numerous disruptions and poor structure make it hard to follow. It's not a 2 because some parts are understandable, but definitely below a 4 due to the significant issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from biblical rivers to town history to snake anecdotes) disrupt logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between paragraphs (e.g., jump from geography to Christian settlement).  
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated assumptions (e.g., equating "Euphrates" with the Mississippi based on euphony).  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**
