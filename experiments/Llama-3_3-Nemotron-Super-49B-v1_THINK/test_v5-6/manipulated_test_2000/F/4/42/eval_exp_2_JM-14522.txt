Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues.

Starting with Fluency: I notice several grammatical errors. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." There's also "when they come to discuss terms" which should be "came." Verb tense inconsistencies like "had felt it his duty" followed by "when they come" are jarring. Then, "the ghost has am see" is clearly wrong; it should be "has been seen." "Recover" should be "recover" (no 'e' at the end). "Come from the corridor" might be better as "emanate" for clarity. 

In the dialogue, "you'dded have it" is a typo for "would have it." "It may had resisted" should be "may have resisted." "Who do not quite understood" is incorrect grammar; it should be "who did not quite understand." "If you don't minded" is wrong; it's "didn't mind." "Regretted" needs an 'ed' but in the context, "never ceased to regret" is correct, so maybe that's okay. "Led the German" probably means "led in German" or "danced the German," which is unclear. "Am his only weaknesses" should be "are." 

"Was usually called" instead of "were." "They am" repeatedly—should be "were." "Have telegraphed" is correct, but "Mr. Otis have" later is subject-verb error. "Was seen" instead of "were seen." "Could was seen" is wrong; "could be seen." "Woulded did it" is a clear mistake; "would have done it." "Started to their feet" should be "jumped to their feet." "Woedn't" is a typo for "wouldn't." "Is extremely upset" should be "was." "Came to" instead of "came to." "Would make any Christian's hair stood" needs "stand." 

Now, Coherence: The story seems mostly coherent, following a logical sequence. However, the transition from the family's skepticism to the ghost's appearance might feel a bit abrupt. The ghost's introduction is sudden, and the twins' actions with the pillow come out of nowhere without setup. Also, some parts like the discussion about American topics feel like they might not contribute much to the plot, causing minor disjointedness.

For Fluency score: Despite many errors, the text is mostly understandable. The mistakes are frequent but not crippling. So maybe a 3? Because it's fluent generally but with obvious errors.

Coherence score: Mostly coherent but some minor issues. Maybe a 4 because the overall structure is good, but there are minor disconnects.

-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Numerous verb tense inconsistencies (e.g., "come" instead of "came," "may had resisted" instead of "may have resisted").  
[GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "Mr. Otis have," "they am").  
[SPELLING] Typos like "you'dded" (should be "would have"), "woedn't" (wouldn’t).  
[LEXICON] Word choice issues (e.g., "led the German," unclear context).  
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of the ghost’s physical appearance and the twins’ intervention.  
[TRANSITION] Sudden shifts (e.g., from dinner conversation to ghostly events without buildup).  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**  
-> 4) Questions: None.
