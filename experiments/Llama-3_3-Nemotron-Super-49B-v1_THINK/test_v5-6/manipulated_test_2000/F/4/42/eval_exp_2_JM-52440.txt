Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper.

Starting with fluency. The text is formal and uses complex sentences, which is appropriate for the topic. However, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "blind consent is blindly give" should be "blindly given." There are subject-verb agreement issues like "those who was loyal" instead of "were." Also, inconsistent verb tenses, such as "was examined" in some places and "is examined" in others. Spelling seems okay, but word choice is sometimes awkward, like "sifting time" which might be unclear to some readers. The structure is mostly logical, but transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Despite these, the text is generally understandable, so fluency score might be 3 or 4. Since the errors are noticeable but don't completely hinder understanding, I'll go with 3.

For coherence, the structure is clear with chapters and headings. The author outlines the objective and sticks to it, investigating each point systematically. However, there are abrupt shifts, like the sudden mention of the Church's current state without clear connection to the preceding discussion. Some paragraphs are very long and dense, making it hard to follow without close attention. The logical flow is mostly there, but the repetition of certain points (e.g., distinction between sign and gift) might cause some disjointedness. The main argument is clear, though. Coherence score would be 4 because while it's well-structured, there are minor issues with transitions and paragraph length.

Now, summarizing the issues. For fluency: grammar errors (subject-verb, tense), some awkward phrasing. For coherence: abrupt transitions, long paragraphs, minor repetition. Make sure to label each issue correctly.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (subject-verb agreement errors, e.g., "blind consent is blindly give"), [SPELLING] (minor typos, e.g., "was supposed to had been settle"), [LEXICON] (awkward phrasing, e.g., "sifting time"), [STRUCTURE] (long, dense paragraphs), [TRANSITION] (abrupt shifts, e.g., "That dear old Church" interruption), [LOGIC] (minor repetition of distinctions without clear progression)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
-> 4) Questions: None
