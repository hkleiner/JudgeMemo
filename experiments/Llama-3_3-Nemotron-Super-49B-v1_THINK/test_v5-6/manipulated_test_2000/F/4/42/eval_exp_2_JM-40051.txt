Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on coherence and fluency. Let me start by reading through the story carefully. The title mentions the Garden of Eden, so the author is arguing that a specific location in the US is the real Eden.

First, for fluency. I notice a lot of grammatical errors. Like "had venture to published it" should be "ventured to publish". There are subject-verb agreement issues, like "I is ignorant". Also, inconsistent verb tenses, such as "was being settled" in a part that's otherwise past tense. Spelling mistakes too, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "am opening" instead of "an opening". Word choice issues, like "moral and intellectual growth" feels a bit awkward. Punctuation could be better; some long sentences without proper breaks.

Now coherence. The structure jumps around a bit. The author starts with their discovery, then goes into biblical references, then describes the location in detail. There's repetition, like mentioning the Mississippi as the Euphrates multiple times. The connection between the biblical garden and the described location isn't always clear. For example, the part about rattlesnakes as the serpent feels forced. The text assumes the reader knows certain biblical details without explanation. Also, the transition from describing the garden to talking about the town's development is abrupt.

So for fluency, despite the many errors, the text is mostly understandable. It's not fluent at all (score 1) because there are too many mistakes, but maybe a 2 or 3? Let me check the scale. Score 3 is "fluent in general with obvious errors hindering flow". Yes, there are obvious errors but you can still follow. So Fluency: 3.

Coherence: The overall structure has some logical flow, but there are abrupt shifts and unclarities. The main point is clear, but supporting details are sometimes disconnected. Score 3 seems right because it's coherent generally but with some issues. Or maybe 2 if the issues are more severe. Wait, the author connects the location to biblical descriptions, but the links are sometimes weak. However, the overall narrative builds towards identifying the location. So maybe coherence is 3.

-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "had venture to published", "I is ignorant", inconsistent verb tenses).  
[SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "am opening").  
[LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "moral and intellectual growth").  
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., snakes to town development).  
[CLARITY] Overly repetitive biblical comparisons.  
[LOGIC] Forced connections (e.g., rattlesnakes as "the Serpent").  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**  
-> 4) Questions: (None)
