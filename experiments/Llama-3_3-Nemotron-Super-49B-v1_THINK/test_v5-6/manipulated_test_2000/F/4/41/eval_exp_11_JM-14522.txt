Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. 

Starting with fluency. The text seems mostly smooth, but there are typos. For example, "seej" instead of "seen", "wdll" maybe "will", "ofteb" should be "often", "xeven" as "seven", "Srripes" likely "Stripes", "vthe" instead of "the", "tuey" as "they", "xnd" for "and", "finebfreedom" probably "free freedom" or a typo, "guarfians" should be "guardians", "alot" as "a lot", "Myerw" maybe "Myers", "librwry" is "library", "evwrything" as "everything", "unmold" perhaps "old", "obpong" maybe "small", "anmold" as "old", "Yhe" should be "The", "n" instead of "and", etc. These are scattered throughout, so while the overall flow is good, the errors might deduct from fluency. But since they're minor and don't hinder understanding much, maybe a 4 for fluency? Because the structure and sentence flow are good despite the typos.

Now coherence. The story flows logically from the introduction of the haunted house, the Otis family's skepticism, the blood stain incidents, and the ghost encounter. Each part connects well. The characters' interactions make sense, and the humor is consistent. There's a clear structure: setup, introduction of the ghost, attempts to deal with it, and the climax with the ghost's appearance. No major gaps or abrupt shifts. So coherence score would be 5, as it's well-structured and each part builds on the last without issues.

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any coherence issues? The transition between chapters is smooth. The family's reactions progress naturally from disbelief to investigation. The ghost's appearance is foreshadowed. I don't see any logical gaps or disjointed sections. So yes, coherence is strong.

So final scores: Fluency 4 (minor typos but overall fluent), Coherence 5 (well-structured and logical).

-> 1) Issues: [SPELLING] (numerous typos: "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xeven", "Srripes", "vthe", "tuey", "xnd", "finebfreedom", "guarfians", "Myerw", "librwry", "evwrything", "unmold", "obpong", "anmold", "Yhe", "n"), [LEXICON] (minor archaic phrasing consistency), [SYNTAX] (rare awkward phrasing due to typos)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: None
