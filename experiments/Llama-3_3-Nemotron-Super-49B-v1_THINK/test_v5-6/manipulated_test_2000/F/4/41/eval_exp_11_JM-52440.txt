Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with fluency: The text is mostly well-written, but there are some typos like "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "ifmthey", "srrvice", "businesbis", "tue", "prssent", "wnd", "invisibly" (maybe a typo but not sure), "incorpoeated", "ln", "tye", and "generak". These are clear spelling errors. Also, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability, but they're structured correctly. The grammar seems okay overall, but the typos are noticeable.

For coherence: The structure is logical, moving from introduction to a specific chapter. The author outlines the topic clearly and uses references (Articles, etc.). However, there's some repetition in emphasizing the distinction between the Church of England's view and others, which might make the text a bit redundant. The transitions between ideas are generally smooth, but the dense theological discussion could make it hard for some readers to follow without background knowledge. No major logical gaps, but the complexity might reduce clarity for non-experts.

Scoring Fluency: The typos are minor but present. Since they don't hinder understanding much, maybe a 4? But wait, the criteria say Score 4 is "minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors with no effect." These typos are minor, so Fluency is 4.

Coherence: The structure is clear, points are well-connected. Some redundancy and complexity, but no major coherence issues. So Coherence would be 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with minor issues.

-> 1) Issues: [SPELLING] (multiple typos: "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "ifmthey", "srrvice", "businesbis", "tue", "prssent", "wnd", "incorpoeated", "ln", "tye", "generak"), [LEXICON] (archaic vocabulary: "vommon", "whomsoever"), [STRUCTURE] (repetitive emphasis on distinctions without added clarity), [CLARITY] (dense theological jargon may impede readability for non-specialists)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: None
