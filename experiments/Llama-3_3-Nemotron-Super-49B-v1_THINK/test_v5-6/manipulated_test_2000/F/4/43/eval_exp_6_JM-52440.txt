Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically the Real Presence.

Starting with fluency. The text is formal, uses complex sentences, and seems mostly grammatically correct. However, there are a few spots where the sentence structure is convoluted, making it a bit hard to follow. For example, some sentences are very long and packed with clauses. I noticed a part where the text says, "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality." That's a bit dense. Also, there's a paragraph with disjointed sentences like "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that." Wait, that part looks like a jumbled mix of words. Maybe a typo or formatting error? That definitely disrupts fluency.

For coherence, the text is well-structured with chapters and clear headings. The author outlines the argument step by step, comparing different doctrines and citing church documents. The flow from introduction to chapter I is logical, building the case. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like when discussing the Articles, it jumps between explaining sacraments in general and then specifics without smooth connections. Also, the repeated emphasis on certain points might make it a bit repetitive, but overall the narrative is clear.

So for fluency, despite some complex sentences and that one jumbled paragraph, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor but noticeable. So maybe a 4? Because it's not entirely fluent due to those issues, but overall well-written.

For coherence, the structure is good, but there are some shifts and repetitions. The main points are clear, but the transitions could be smoother. So coherence might be a 4 as well, since there are minor disconnects but overall it holds together.

Wait, but the jumbled paragraph is a major fluency issue. If that's an error, it's a significant one. But maybe it's a transcription mistake. Assuming it's part of the original text, that would lower fluency more. But the rest of the text is well-written. So maybe fluency is a 3? Because that one section is really bad. But the majority is fluent. The criteria say score 3 is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." That jumbled part is a big error. So maybe 3 for fluency.

Coherence: The structure is logical, but some parts feel a bit disconnected, like when moving from scripture discussion to the Articles. But overall, it's coherent. So maybe coherence is a 4.

So final scores: Fluency 3, Coherence 4.

Issues for fluency: [SYNTAX] (convoluted sentences), [SPELLING/TYPEO] (jumbled text), [LEXICON] (some word choices obscure). For coherence: [STRUCTURE] (some transitions), [CLARITY] (repetitions).

-> 1) Issues: [SYNTAX] (Overly complex sentence structures), [SPELLING/TYPEO] (Jumbled text in paragraph), [LEXICON] (Archaisms and dense vocabulary), [STRUCTURE] (Abrupt transitions between ideas), [CLARITY] (Repetitive explanations)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
-> 4) Questions: (None)
