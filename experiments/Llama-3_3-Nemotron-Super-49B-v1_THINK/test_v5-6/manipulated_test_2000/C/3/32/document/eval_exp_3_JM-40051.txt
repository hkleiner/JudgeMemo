Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify issues related to coherence and fluency. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. 

Starting with fluency: The text is quite old-fashioned, which might affect readability. I notice some archaic terms like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians), "thing" used repeatedly where it seems like a placeholder or error, and phrases like "the thing, CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" which is unclear. There are also spelling mistakes, such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" for "dimensions", and "scientest" for "scientist". Grammar issues include sentence structure that's sometimes convoluted, like the long, winding sentences without clear punctuation. For example, the paragraph starting "When God made man..." is hard to follow due to its length and complexity. 

Now for coherence: The narrative jumps around a lot. The author switches between biblical references, personal anecdotes, geographical descriptions, and defensive comments about criticism. There's repetition, especially in describing the beauty of the location. The structure isn't very logical; it starts with a principle, then dives into biblical history, then the discovery, and mixes in various details without a clear flow. The author assumes some background knowledge, like the significance of certain river names or locations, which might confuse readers. Also, the transition from talking about the garden to mentioning snakes and then Christians destroying them feels abrupt.

Scoring Fluency: Despite the challenges, the text is mostly understandable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely hinder understanding. So maybe a 3? It's fluent generally but with obvious errors.

Coherence: The story has a clear overall claim, but the execution is disjointed. There are abrupt shifts and some ambiguities, but the main points can be followed with effort. So a 3 as well? Or maybe a 2 because the disconnects are pretty significant?

Wait, the coherence scale says a 3 is "coherent in general with some abrupt shifts," which fits. Fluency's 3 is "fluent in general with some obvious grammatical errors." Yes, that matches. But wait, the "thing" placeholders are really distracting. Does that affect fluency more? Maybe it's more than just minor issues. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fluency is a 2 because of major errors like missing components (the "thing" might indicate missing words), but the rest of the text has some fluent parts. 

I think the "thing" errors are major because they disrupt understanding in several places. So Fluency might be a 2. Coherence, despite the jumps, still has a overarching argument, so maybe 3.

But I need to check the criteria again. For Fluency 2: "major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments." The "thing" could be missing components. The spelling and grammar errors are major. So Fluency 2. Coherence 3 because it's coherent in general but with some issues.

Yes, that makes sense. So final scores: Coherence 3, Fluency 2.

-> 1) Issues: [SPELLING] (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "dimentions", "scientest"), [SYNTAX] (convoluted sentence structures), [STRUCTURE] (nonlinear narrative jumps), [CLARITY] (repetitive descriptions, unclear placeholders like "the thing"), [LEXICON] (archaic language), [LOGIC] (assumes unstated knowledge of geography/biblical context)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2  
-> 4) Questions: Are "the thing" and similar gaps intentional placeholders or errors?
