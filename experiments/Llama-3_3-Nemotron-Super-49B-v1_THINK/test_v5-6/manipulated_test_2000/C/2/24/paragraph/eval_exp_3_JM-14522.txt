Okay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to read the story carefully and understand the evaluation criteria for Fluency and Coherence. The user provided a detailed setup, so I should focus on the given text.

Starting with Fluency: I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The story seems well-written, but there might be some anachronisms or word choices that stick out. For example, terms like "hologram," "bluetooth signal," and "surveillance camera" are modern and might disrupt the 19th-century setting. These are likely errors in LEXICON because they don't fit the time period.

Now for Coherence: The story structure seems logical, but there might be abrupt transitions or inconsistencies. The introduction of modern tech terms could cause coherence issues by breaking the narrative's historical consistency. Also, the ghost's appearance and the family's reactions need to flow smoothly. However, the main plot points connect well, so maybe minor issues here.

Looking at the metrics: For Fluency, if there are obvious errors (like the anachronisms) that hinder flow, that's a Score 3. For Coherence, if the anachronisms cause minor disruptions but the overall story holds, maybe a Score 4.

Wait, the anachronisms are significant. They might not just be minor. If they disrupt the flow noticeably, Fluency could drop to 2. But the rest of the text is fluent. The criteria say Score 2 has major errors but some fluent parts. Since the story is mostly well-written except for those terms, maybe Score 3 for Fluency because the errors are obvious but don't completely halt understanding.

For Coherence, the anachronisms might cause slight confusion but the narrative is otherwise well-structured. So Score 4 because only minor parts are disconnected.

I should list the issues under appropriate labels. LEXICON for the modern terms, maybe STRUCTURE if the transitions are off, but the chapters seem to flow. Also, check if the ghost's behavior and the family's reactions are consistent. The Minister's calm response is humorous and fits the comedic tone, so that's intentional, not a coherence issue.

Finalizing: Fluency issues with LEXICON (anachronisms), maybe minor SYNTAX if any, but the main problem is the modern terms. Coherence is mostly good but minor disruptions from those terms. So Fluency 3, Coherence 4.

-> 1) Issues: [LEXICON] (anachronistic terms like "hologram," "bluetooth," "surveillance camera" disrupt historical setting); [STRUCTURE] (minor abruptness in tech references within period narrative)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
-> 4) Questions: Are intentional anachronisms (e.g., for comedic effect) considered errors under LEXICON, or contextual allowances?
