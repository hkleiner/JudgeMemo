Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on the criteria for Coherence and Fluency, using the provided scales. 

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure seems formal and academic. 

Starting with Fluency: The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar, spelling, and syntax. The sentences are complex but structured. However, there are some very long sentences that might affect flow. For example, the paragraph starting "These are the Articles..." has a sentence that's quite long and dense. Also, there are abrupt transitions between ideas, like the mention of "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" which seems out of placeâ€”maybe a formatting error or a misplaced sentence. These could be minor issues but don't hinder understanding much. So Fluency might be a 4, as there are minor non-fluent parts but overall fluent.

For Coherence: The structure is logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. The author outlines the objective clearly and follows through. However, there are abrupt jumps, like the sudden "The biosensor updated its readout" at the end, which disrupts the flow. Also, some paragraphs feel a bit repetitive in emphasizing the distinction between the Church of England and Rome. The transitions between sections could be smoother, and some sections might feel disconnected due to these interruptions. Despite this, the overall narrative is coherent, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnected parts.

Now, checking the criteria again. Fluency Score 4 because minor issues but mostly fluent. Coherence Score 4 since minor disruptions but overall coherent. Issues to list: [STRUCTURE] for the abrupt transitions and misplaced sentences, [TRANSITION] for lack of smooth connections, [LEXICON] if any word choices are awkward (but here it's formal, so maybe not), and [LOGIC] if there's any inconsistency (but the argument seems logical). 

Wait, the "autonomous vehicle" and "biosensor" lines are clearly errors, probably from some technical glitch. They disrupt the structure. So [STRUCTURE] and [TRANSITION] issues. Also, the long sentences might affect [FLUENCY] under [SYNTAX]. 

Finalizing: Issues under STRUCTURE and TRANSITION for coherence, and SYNTAX for fluency. Scores 4 for both, as the issues are minor but present.

-> 1) Issues: [STRUCTURE] (Abrupt, unrelated sentences like "The autonomous vehicle..."), [TRANSITION] (Lack of smooth connections between paragraphs), [SYNTAX] (Occasional overly complex sentence structures)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: None
