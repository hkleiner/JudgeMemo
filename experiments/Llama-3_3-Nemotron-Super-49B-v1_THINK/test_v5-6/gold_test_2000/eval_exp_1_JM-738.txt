Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully and then evaluate both Coherence and Fluency based on the given criteria.

Starting with Coherence. The story seems to be about Dickens's last plot, specifically "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The text is an analysis by Andrew Lang. The structure starts with an introduction discussing Dickens's later works and his focus on plot construction, then moves into a chapter on the story, listing characters and their relationships, followed by the opening of the tale with scenes in Cloisterham.

Looking for coherence issues: The transition from the introduction to the character list (Dramatis Person√¶) feels a bit abrupt. The introduction talks about Dickens's methods and then suddenly jumps into outlining the characters without a clear connector. Also, within the character descriptions, there are a lot of details that might be overwhelming. For example, the relationship between John Jasper, Edwin, and Rosa is complex, and the connections (like the possibility of Princess Puffer being Jasper's mother) are introduced without much buildup. 

In the opening of the tale, the scene shifts from Jasper in the opium den to Cloisterham, introducing various characters like the Dean and Minor Canon Crisparkle. These introductions are somewhat rapid, and the pacing might feel rushed. There's also a mention of Sir Luke Fildes's illustration, which breaks the narrative flow a bit since it's a real-world reference inserted into the analysis.

For Fluency, checking grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and spelling. However, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, which might hinder flow. For example, the sentence describing Princess Puffer's timeline ("If she has been dealing in opium for ten years...") is complex and requires careful reading. There are also transitions between paragraphs that could be smoother. The use of quotes (like "the bloom is off the plum") is good, but sometimes the integration feels a bit forced.

Another point: The author frequently switches between analyzing Dickens's techniques and summarizing the plot. While this is understandable, it might cause slight disjointedness. For instance, the discussion about Dickens's interest in the supernatural feels like a tangent, though relevant.

Coherence Score: The story has a clear overall structure, but the abrupt transitions and information density in character descriptions might reduce coherence. However, the main points are logically connected, so it's not severely incoherent. Maybe a 4, because the main issues are minor but noticeable.

Fluency Score: Mostly fluent, but some long sentences and forced transitions. No major errors, so a 4 as well, since the minor issues don't greatly affect flow.

-> 1) Issues: [STRUCTURE] (Abrupt transition from introduction to character list), [CLARITY] (Overly complex character relationships without clear buildup), [TRANSITION] (Rapid scene shifts in opening tale), [LEXICON] (Occasional forced integration of real-world references)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: None
