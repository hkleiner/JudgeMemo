Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

Starting with the Introduction chapter, the writing seems formal and old-fashioned, which is expected given the topic about the Church of England's doctrines. The author discusses the Real Presence doctrine and plans to examine church documents. The structure is clear: introduction, then Chapter I on Real Presence. 

Looking at fluency: The text is well-structured with proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Sentences are complex but clear. However, some sentences are very long and dense, which might affect readability. For example, the paragraph starting "That the most precious body..." has multiple clauses. But overall, it's fluent with minor issues from length and archaic style.

For coherence: The narrative is logical, moving from introduction to specific points. The author sets up the problem, states the objective, and outlines the structure (examining Articles, Catechism, etc.). Transitions between ideas are smooth. The only potential issue is some repetition, like reiterating the focus on Church documents, but it's intentional for emphasis. The main points are well-connected, and the comparison between Rome's and England's doctrines is clear.

Now, checking the criteria. Fluency score: The text has no major errors, just some lengthy sentences. So maybe a 4? Coherence is strong, well-organized, so 5?

Wait, the metric says Score 5 for Coherence if entirely coherent and well-structured. This text meets that. For Fluency, despite long sentences, it's still fluent with minor non-fluent parts, so 4.

Issues to list: For Fluency, maybe [SYNTAX] for long complex sentences. For Coherence, none major, but maybe [STRUCTURE] if any minor transitions, but I don't see any. So maybe no coherence issues.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 5. Issues under Fluency: [SYNTAX] for complex sentence structure. Coherence has no issues.

-> 1) Issues: [SYNTAX] (Occasional overly complex sentence structures); [LEXICON] (Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: None
