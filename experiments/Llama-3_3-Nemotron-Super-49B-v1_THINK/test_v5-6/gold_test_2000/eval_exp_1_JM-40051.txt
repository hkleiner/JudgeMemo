Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is archaic. Words like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "commencement" instead of "beginning". There are some typos like "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "Bridtish" (British). The sentences are long and complex, which might make them hard to follow, but that's common in older writing. Grammar seems mostly correct despite the typos. So fluency issues are mainly due to outdated language and a few minor errors. Maybe a score of 4 because the errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much.

For coherence, the structure is a bit meandering. The author jumps between biblical references, personal discovery, and geographical descriptions. There's repetition about the garden's features and comparisons to the Bible. The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. However, the overall narrative is clear: proposing a location as Eden. Some parts feel like they repeat ideas, like the beauty and the rivers. But the main points connect logically. Maybe a coherence score of 4 because while there are some abrupt shifts and repetitions, the overall structure is understandable.

Wait, but the author switches between talking about the Bible, his discovery, and then detailed geography. Maybe that's a bit disjointed. But each section relates to the main claim. So coherence is mostly maintained but with some minor issues. Hence, Coherence 4 and Fluency 4.

-> 1) Issues: [SPELLING] (e.g., "admirirg", "dimentions", "scientest", "Bridtish"), [LEXICON] (archaic vocabulary and phrasing), [STRUCTURE] (meandering narrative with repetitive descriptions), [TRANSITION] (abrupt shifts between biblical analysis and geographical details), [CLARITY] (overly complex sentence structures)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: (None)
