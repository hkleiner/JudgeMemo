Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to understand the task properly. The story is a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The user provided detailed criteria for coherence and fluency.

Starting with fluency: I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text is formal, written in a somewhat archaic style (words like "thou", "thee"), which might affect readability but isn't an error. The sentences are long and complex, which could hinder flow. However, there are no obvious grammatical errors. The vocabulary is appropriate but dense. So fluency might be a 4 because while it's well-written, the complexity might cause some non-fluent parts.

For coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and logical progression. Each chapter addresses a specific point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author uses authoritative documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.) to support arguments. Transitions between ideas are smooth. However, the text is repetitive in emphasizing the Church of England's stance against Real Presence. Some sections repeat the same point multiple times, which might disrupt coherence slightly. But overall, it's well-structured and coherent, so coherence score might be 4 as well, since there are minor repetitions but no major disconnects.

Now, checking the metrics again. Fluency: The text is entirely fluent with no errors, but the archaic style and lengthy sentences might make it slightly less smooth for modern readers. So maybe a 4. Coherence: Well-structured, logical, but some repetition. Still, coherence is strong, so 4.

Issues to list: For fluency, maybe [SYNTAX] for long sentences. For coherence, [REPEAT] for repetition. But need to check if the structure has any flaws. The author jumps between different documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) but does so in a logical manner. The only issue might be the repetition in refuting the same argument multiple times.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 4. Issues would be [SYNTAX] for complex sentences and [REPEAT] for repetitive points. No other major issues. Questions: Maybe ask if the archaic language affects fluency scoring, but the user said to avoid explanations.

-> 1) Issues: [SYNTAX] (Extremely lengthy, complex sentences hindering readability); [REPEAT] (Repetitive refutations of the same argument across chapters)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: Does the archaic language style (e.g., "thou," antiquated phrasing) impact fluency scoring despite technical correctness?
