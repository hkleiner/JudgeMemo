Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the story and identify the issues related to coherence and fluency. 

Starting with coherence: The story is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which I recognize as a classic. Coherence is about how the story unfolds logically and connects ideas. The original story is known for its structure and flow, but maybe there are some changes or additions here that affect coherence. Let me check the provided text.

Looking at the chapters, the narrative progresses from the Otis family moving in, encountering the ghost, various attempts by the ghost to scare them, and finally Virginia's interaction leading to the ghost's peace. The structure seems logical, but there are some inserted lines that might disrupt coherence. For example, in Chapter II, there's a mention of a "deepfake filter" which is anachronistic. Similarly, terms like "autonomous vehicle", "voice command", "AI core", "biosensor", "wireless charger", "self-driving cart" are all modern tech references that don't fit the 19th-century setting. These could cause coherence issues by introducing elements that break the time period consistency.

Also, in Chapter V, Virginia talks about her father giving the ghost a free passage to America and mentions customs duties, which might seem a bit off but isn't a major coherence problem. The main plot points follow logically, but these tech terms are jarring.

For fluency: The original text is fluent with witty dialogue and descriptive language. However, the inserted modern terms might disrupt the flow. For example, "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" in Chapter I is out of place. Other terms like "voice command triggered automation", "A backup drive clicked to life", "A soundbar adjusted volume automatically" are all modern and disrupt the historical fluency. These could affect the score for fluency as they cause awkwardness and errors in period consistency.

Additionally, some sentences might have slight grammatical issues, but the main problem is the anachronistic terms. The dialogue mostly remains fluent, but the tech inserts make the text less smooth.

So, for issues:

Coherence:
- [ANACHRONISM] Multiple modern technological references disrupt the 19th-century setting.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is good, but some scenes (like the ghost's final interaction) might feel a bit rushed, but that's minor.

Fluency:
- [LEXICON] Use of modern terms (deepfake, autonomous vehicle, etc.) disrupts period-appropriate language.
- [SYNTAX] Mostly okay, but some sentences with modern phrases might have slight awkwardness.

Scoring:

Coherence: The story is mostly coherent, but the anachronisms cause some disruption. However, the main narrative flows well. So maybe a 4, as the anachronisms are notable but don't completely break the coherence.

Fluency: The language is generally fluent, but the modern terms cause non-fluent parts. Since these are scattered but noticeable, maybe a 3, as there are obvious errors hindering flow.

Wait, but the metric says Score 4 for Fluency is "only minor non-fluent parts". The anachronistic terms are more than minor; they're jarring. So maybe Fluency is 3 because they hinder the flow, but the rest is well-written. 

Coherence Score 4 because the anachronisms are minor in terms of overall structure, but affect coherence slightly. 

Finalizing:

Issues:
- [ANACHRONISM] Modern tech terms in a 19th-century setting.
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent vocabulary usage.

Coherence: 4
Fluency: 3

No questions.
