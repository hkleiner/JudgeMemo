Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a biography of Will Bradley, structured in chapters. 

Starting with coherence. The story is divided into chapters that follow Bradley's life chronologically. Each chapter seems to transition smoothly, covering different periods of his life. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like the insertion of the text about Millet's painting style in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING". That part feels out of place and disrupts the narrative flow. Also, some sections have quoted dialogue or descriptions that aren't clearly connected to the main story, which might confuse the reader.

For fluency, the writing is generally good, but there are some awkward phrasings. For example, "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The dash before "wages" is a bit jarring; a comma or rephrasing might be better. There are also long, convoluted sentences, like the description of the 1895 visit to the Boston Public Library. These could be broken up for easier reading. Spelling and grammar seem mostly correct, but I need to check for any errors. 

I should also look for consistency in style. The narrative shifts between first and second person (e.g., "You are six years old" to "I can say for all these latecomers"), which might be intentional for stylistic effect but could affect coherence. 

For coherence score: The overall structure is logical, but the random insertions and some unclear transitions might deduct points. Maybe a 4 because the main narrative is clear, but minor issues exist.

For fluency: The text is mostly fluent, but some sentence structures and punctuation choices cause minor hindrances. Maybe a 4 as well, since the issues are minor and don't heavily impact flow.

Now, summarizing the issues in bullet points with labels. For coherence, the main issues are abrupt shifts (like the Millet paragraph) and some unclear connections. For fluency, awkward phrasing and punctuation, long sentences, and inconsistent narrative voice.

Final scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 4. No questions needed.

-> 1) Issues:  
[COHERENCE] Abrupt, unconnected narrative inserts (e.g., Millet passage in "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING").  
[COHERENCE] Minor gaps in transitional flow between chapters (e.g., "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" lacks clear thematic link).  
[FLUENCY] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week").  
[FLUENCY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., 1895 Boston Library description).  
[FLUENCY] Inconsistent narrative voice (first/second person shifts).  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  
-> 4) Questions: None
