Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The author analyzes various church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies to argue against the Real Presence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in an old style, probably 19th century. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. Checking for grammar and spelling: I notice some typos like "Taughtvby" (should be "Taught by"), "ans" (and), "vlindly" (blindly), "experiejced" (experienced), "iur" (our), "inbdonnexionnwith" (in connexion with), "thys" (these), "honet" (honest), etc. These are minor but numerous. Syntax is generally correct but archaic. Word choice is formal, appropriate for the topic. Punctuation seems okay, though commas might be excessive in some places. So Fluency score: The typos and archaic language might hinder flow a bit, but overall it's well-written. Maybe a 4 because the errors are minor and don't severely impact understanding.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear: Introduction, chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice. Each chapter analyzes different documents. The author's argument is logical, transitioning between points. However, the text is dense and assumes prior knowledge of theological debates. Some sections repeat the main point (e.g., emphasizing the Church's documents over assertions). Are there abrupt shifts? Not really; each chapter focuses on a distinct aspect. The conclusion ties back to the importance of understanding the Church's true teachings. Coherence score: Well-structured, clear progression, but density and repetition might slightly reduce coherence. Maybe a 4 because while it's mostly coherent, the complexity and some repetitive emphasis could make it slightly less clear for some readers.

Issues to list: For Fluency, typos and archaic language. For Coherence, density and repetition. Other labels? Maybe [STRUCTURE] for coherence, but structure is good. [CLARITY] could be an issue due to complexity.

Finalizing scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 4. Issues bullet points with appropriate labels.

-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Multiple minor typos (e.g., "Taughtvby", "experiejced", "inbdonnexionnwith").  
[LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "sorely tried", "nought").  
[CLARITY] Dense theological jargon and assumed prior knowledge.  
[STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on refuting opposing views.  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  
-> 4) Questions: None.
