Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency. First, I'll read through the story to understand its structure and content. The story is about Will Bradley's life, divided into chapters. Each chapter covers a different period in his life, from his childhood to his career in design and publishing.

Starting with coherence. Coherence is about how well the story holds together, logical flow, and whether ideas are connected. The story is biographical, so it should follow a chronological order, which it does. Each chapter transitions to the next stage of his life. However, the chapters are quite long and dense. There might be some abrupt shifts between chapters, but since they're labeled with clear time periods, that might help. I need to check if there are any jumps or inconsistencies. For example, the transition from his early life to Chicago and then to different roles might be smooth because each chapter is titled with a specific time or place. But the narrative within chapters might have a lot of detailed anecdotes. The reader might need to piece together how these events contribute to the overall narrative. Also, the use of first and second person (e.g., "you" and "I") in different chapters could cause some disorientation. The chapter "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" uses "you," which is unusual and might disrupt coherence for some readers.

Now, fluency. Fluency looks at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text has some archaic language and terms specific to the printing industry, which might make it less fluent for modern readers not familiar with those terms. There are also some typos or possible scanning errors, like "introduduction" instead of "introduction," "ghe" instead of "the," "dtartling" instead of "startling," "aplw" instead of "apple," etc. These errors would affect the fluency score. The writing style is mostly formal and descriptive, with long sentences. While the sentences are grammatically correct for the most part, their complexity and length, combined with outdated vocabulary, could hinder smooth reading. For example, phrases like "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater" are poetic but might slow the reader.

Checking the criteria: For Coherence, a score of 5 means entirely coherent. This story is well-structured chronologically, but the dense content and shifts in narrative voice might cause minor issues. Maybe a 4 because there are some minor disconnected parts but overall it's coherent. For Fluency, despite the typos and complex language, the majority is well-written. The typos are minor but present, so maybe a 4 as well, since they don't completely hinder understanding but are noticeable.

Wait, but the typos like "introduduction" are definitely errors. How many are there? Let me check again. The sample provided has several: "AN INTEODUCTION", "ghe", "dtartling", "aplw", "tlv", "ksn't", "ycur", "thd", "sqart", "tkme", "idda", "ynur", "movjes", "generohs", "strcture" (though not sure if that's a typo or not), "Nineties" capitalized incorrectly in some places, "Cokonial", "exhuberant", "non-repetitive" (maybe intended), "typographic" misspelled as "typograhic" in one place, "McVickar Theater" inconsistent capitalization, "Vincennes Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street" (style issue, but not a typo), "straw onnthe", "q new section", "planks are a foot or more above the ground" (could be correct, but awkward), "Mwrtin", "heb", "theb", "vnd", "q", "anr", "vof", "vntil", "vnd" again. These are numerous. So even though the text is mostly fluent, the frequency of typos would lower the fluency score. Maybe a 3 for fluency because there are obvious errors that hinder flow, even if the rest is well-written.

Coherence: The story's structure is clear, each chapter marks a new period. The use of "you" in one chapter is odd but doesn't break coherence entirely. The themes of his career progression and design influences are consistent. So coherence might still be a 4, as the overall structure is good despite some minor shifts.

So final scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 3.

Issues to list for coherence: Possible disorientation from narrative voice changes, some dense sections. For fluency: numerous typos, complex sentences, archaic terms.
