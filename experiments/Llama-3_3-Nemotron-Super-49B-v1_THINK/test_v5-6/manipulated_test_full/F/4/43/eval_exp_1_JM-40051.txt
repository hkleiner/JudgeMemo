Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify the issues under Fluency and Coherence. The text is quite long, so I'll have to scan through it methodically.

Starting with Fluency: This involves grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. Looking at the text, there are some obvious grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "On the principle of “first know you are right, then go ahead,”" should probably be "first know that you are right." There are also missing articles and awkward phrasing. The syntax is sometimes convoluted, making sentences hard to follow. I notice repeated phrases like "Come and see!" which might be intentional for emphasis but could be seen as repetitive. Spelling seems okay, but there are some archaic terms or possibly typos like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians." 

Now, Coherence: The structure is a bit all over the place. The author jumps between describing the garden, biblical references, geographical details, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions. There are abrupt shifts, like moving from geography to a quote from Bishop Foss without a smooth link. The main argument about the Garden of Eden's location is repeated multiple times, which might be redundant. However, the overall idea is somewhat clear despite the meandering structure.

For Fluency score: The text has numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but it's not completely incoherent. Maybe a 3? Because it's generally fluent but with obvious errors hindering flow.

For Coherence score: The structure is disjointed, with many abrupt transitions and repetitions. However, the central idea holds, even if poorly organized. So maybe a 3 as well, since it's coherent in general but with significant clarity issues.

Wait, but looking back, the Coherence issues are more severe. The text lacks a clear progression, repeats points, and has unclear connections between sections. That might push it to a 2. But the author does try to connect biblical descriptions with the location, so there's some coherence. Hmm. Maybe 3 is still right because the overall context is understandable with effort.

Finalizing: Fluency 3, Coherence 3. But let me check the criteria again. Fluency 3 is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." Yes, that fits. Coherence 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity." That also fits. So the scores would be 3 and 3.

But wait, the Fluency has more than just some errors. The sentence structure is often clumsy, and there are multiple errors per paragraph. Maybe Fluency 2? Because "There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments." The text does have major errors but still has some clear parts. So maybe 2 for Fluency. Coherence, despite the structure issues, the main point is there, so 3.

Yes, that makes sense. So final scores: Fluency 2, Coherence 3.

-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," missing articles, awkward phrasing).  
[SYNTAX] Convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man to dwell...").  
[REPETITION] Repeated phrases ("Come and see!") and redundant ideas.  
[LOGIC] Unresolved assumptions (e.g., linking geography to biblical descriptions without clear evidence).  
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (geography, anecdotes, biblical quotes).  
[CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions and unclear connections between ideas.  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **2**  
-> 4) Questions: (None)
