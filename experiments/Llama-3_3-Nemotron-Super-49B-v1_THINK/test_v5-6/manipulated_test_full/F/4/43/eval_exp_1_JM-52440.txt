Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The author analyzes various church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies to argue against the Real Presence doctrine.

Starting with Fluency: The text is formal, complex, with long sentences. I notice some archaic language ("IT is a very easy thing..."), which might affect readability. There are no obvious grammar or spelling errors, but the syntax is sometimes convoluted. For example, sentences like "My present concern is with the fact that, however we explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life" are clear but lengthy. The vocabulary is appropriate but dense, using terms like "transubstantiation" and "consubstantiation" which might require familiarity. Overall, while fluent, the complexity and outdated style might make it slightly less than perfect. Fluency Score: 4.

Next, Coherence: The structure is logical, moving from introduction to chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each chapter references specific documents, building a coherent argument. Transitions between sections are clear, and the author consistently contrasts Church of England teachings with Roman Catholic beliefs. However, the text is quite dense and repetitive in emphasizing points (e.g., repeated references to the 28th Article). Some sections, like the lengthy quotes from Homilies, might disrupt flow for some readers. The overall narrative is well-organized, but the repetition and density could make it slightly less cohesive for casual readers. Coherence Score: 4.

Now, summarizing issues in bullet points. For Fluency: [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences; [LEXICON] Archaisms and specialized vocabulary. For Coherence: [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on certain points; [CLARITY] Density of theological references might obscure clarity for non-experts.

Scores: Fluency 4 (minor non-fluent parts but overall good), Coherence 4 (some minor disconnected parts but generally well-structured).

-> 1) Issues:  
[SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences;  
[LEXICON] Archaisms and specialized theological vocabulary;  
[STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on key points (e.g., Article 28);  
[CLARITY] Density of doctrinal references may obscure clarity for non-experts.  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  
-> 4) Questions: None.
