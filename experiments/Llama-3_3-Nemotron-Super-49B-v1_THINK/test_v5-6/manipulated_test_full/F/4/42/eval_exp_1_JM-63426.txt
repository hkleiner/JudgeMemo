Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a biography of Will Bradley, structured in chapters. The story seems to follow his life from childhood to his career in design and printing.

Starting with coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows, whether ideas are connected, and if there's a logical structure. The chapters are chronological, which is good. Each chapter covers a different period of Bradley's life. However, the transitions between chapters might be abrupt. For example, moving from his childhood in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" to "First Sojourn in Chicago" might feel a bit disconnected without a clear bridge. Also, within chapters, there are detailed descriptions of his experiences, but some parts might feel like lists of events rather than a narrative flow. For instance, the "Chronology" section is a list, which breaks the narrative flow. 

Now, looking at fluency. Fluency involves grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is mostly well-written. I noticed a few grammatical errors, like "you was" instead of "you were" in "The Boy Printer" chapter. There are also some long, complex sentences that might hinder flow. For example, the sentence starting with "When the Iron Ore job printer leaves..." has multiple clauses and could be split. Word choice is generally good, but some archaic terms (like "pi" for type pieces) might confuse modern readers without context, though the story explains it.

For coherence score: The structure is mostly logical, but some transitions are weak, and the inclusion of the chronology and afterword disrupts the narrative. Maybe a 4 because it's generally coherent but has minor issues.

For fluency score: A few errors and some clunky sentences, but overall fluent. Maybe a 4 as well, since the errors are minor and don't greatly impact understanding.

Wait, the "you was" error is a clear grammatical mistake. That's a [GRAMMAR] issue. Also, the long sentences could be [SYNTAX]. The chronology section's presence might affect [STRUCTURE] under coherence. 

So, for issues:

1) [GRAMMAR] - "you was" instead of "you were"
2) [SYNTAX] - Complex, hard-to-follow sentences
3) [STRUCTURE] - Abrupt transitions between chapters, inclusion of chronology breaks narrative

Coherence score: 4 (some minor disconnects but overall clear)
Fluency score: 4 (minor errors, some syntax issues but mostly fluent)

I think that's it. Let me check the criteria again to make sure. Coherence 4 allows for minor disconnected parts not affecting overall coherence. Fluency 4 has minor non-fluent parts but no major errors. Yes, that fits.

-> 1) Issues:  
  [GRAMMAR] - "you was" (should be "you were") in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming"  
  [SYNTAX] - Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "When the Iron Ore job printer leaves...")  
  [STRUCTURE] - Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from biography to "Chronology")  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  
-> 4) Questions: None
