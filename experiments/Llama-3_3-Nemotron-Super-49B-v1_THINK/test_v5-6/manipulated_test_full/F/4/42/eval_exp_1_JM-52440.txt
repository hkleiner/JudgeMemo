Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically the Real Presence. The author is arguing against the Real Presence, using Church documents like Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in an older style (probably 19th century). The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and lexicon issues. Scanning through, I notice some archaic language like "was" instead of "were" in places (e.g., "we was one bread"). That's a grammatical error. Also, terms like "THEMSELVES" in all caps might be for emphasis but are unconventional. Punctuation seems mostly correct, but the lengthy sentences could hinder flow. However, the language is mostly correct despite being formal and somewhat outdated. So Fluency score: maybe 4 because there are minor errors but overall fluent.

For Coherence, the structure is clear with chapters and headings. The author builds an argument step by step, citing different documents. Each chapter focuses on a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Transitions between ideas are logical. However, the text is dense and assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and Church documents, which might make it hard for some readers to follow. There's repetition in emphasizing the Church's stance, but it's intentional for argumentation. No major gaps in logic. So Coherence score: 5 because it's well-structured and coherent throughout.

Now, summarizing issues. For Fluency: archaic language, some grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement), inconsistent capitalization. For Coherence: none major, but possibly complexity due to assumptions of background knowledge. But since the criteria don't penalize for complexity if the structure is clear, maybe no coherence issues. Wait, the user's instruction says to list problems leading to point deduction. If the text is too dense or assumes knowledge, does that affect coherence? The evaluation criteria for Coherence mention "clear progression" and "avoidance of ambiguities". Assuming background knowledge might cause ambiguity for some readers, but the text is targeted at a specific audience. Since the author uses clear references and structure, maybe it's still coherent. So perhaps no coherence issues to list. Fluency issues are minor, so score 4. Coherence score 5.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (archaic "was" for "were"; inconsistent capitalization); [LEXICON] (formal, outdated terminology); [STRUCTURE] (assumes theological background knowledge, dense paragraphs)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions: None
