Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants me to evaluate this story based on coherence and fluency, right? The story is about Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The text provided is an analysis by Andrew Lang discussing various theories about the unfinished novel.

First, I need to recall the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads—grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice. Coherence is about how well the story holds together as a whole, logical flow, structure, etc.

Looking at the text, it's a non-fiction analysis, not the story itself. The user might have made a mistake, but assuming the task is to evaluate Lang's analysis:

Fluency: The text is written in a somewhat archaic style (e.g., "whilst", "woulded", "am obliged to dissent"). There are some grammatical errors like "woulded excuse himself" (should be "would excuse"). Also, "would was" instead of "was". The structure is complex with long sentences, which might make it hard to follow. However, overall, it's mostly fluent despite some errors and outdated language.

Coherence: The analysis jumps between different theories (Proctor, Walters) and includes external evidence like Forster's notes and illustrations. It's structured with clear headings (THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY, FORSTER’S EVIDENCE, etc.), but the transitions between ideas could be smoother. The author assumes knowledge of the original story and its characters, which might confuse someone not familiar with "Edwin Drood". However, the logic connecting the theories is mostly there, even if dense.

So for Fluency, maybe a 3? Because there are obvious errors but it's generally understandable. For Coherence, also a 3 because while it's structured, the complexity and assumptions might cause some confusion.

Wait, but the metric says Score 3 for Fluency is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." Yes, that fits. For Coherence, Score 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity." The analysis has some shifts between theories but overall follows a logical path, so 3 makes sense.

Issues for Fluency: [GRAMMAR] (e.g., "woulded"), [LEXICON] (archaic terms), [SYNTAX] (long complex sentences). For Coherence: [STRUCTURE] (assumes background knowledge), [CLARITY] (dense analysis), [TRANSITION] (abrupt shifts between theories).

So the final answer would list those issues, scores 3 for both.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (archaic/incorrect verb forms like "woulded"), [LEXICON] (outdated terminology), [SYNTAX] (overly complex sentence structures), [STRUCTURE] (assumes prior knowledge of *Edwin Drood*), [CLARITY] (dense, layered analysis), [TRANSITION] (abrupt shifts between theories)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
-> 4) Questions: Is the text evaluating the original *Edwin Drood* or Lang’s analysis? (Clarification needed for precise scoring.)
