Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency, using specific labels and a score from 1 to 5 with half-points.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a historical religious text, probably from the 19th century given the style. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. 

Looking for fluency issues: Grammar, Spelling, Syntax, Lexicon. Also coherence aspects like Logic, Structure, Clarity, Transitions, but the task specifies fluency here, which is about sentence quality, grammar, phrasing, etc.

Checking for grammatical errors. The text uses complex sentences with multiple clauses, but they seem structured correctly. For example, "IT is a very easy thing..." uses capital "IT" which might be a typo or old-style capitalization. Maybe [SPELLING] for that? Or is it intentional as a title? The chapter headings have all caps, so maybe "IT" is just the start of the sentence in a new chapter, so not an error.

Syntax: Some long sentences, but they follow correct structure. For instance, "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence..." is a bit winding but grammatically correct. Maybe [SYNTAX] for complexity affecting clarity, but the user's scale says fluency is about being natural and clear. If the sentences are clear despite length, maybe not a major issue.

Lexicon: Uses words like "sacramental", "invisibly", "consecration" which are appropriate for the topic. No obvious lexical errors.

Spelling: I didn't notice any typos. The word "connexion" is an old spelling of "connection", common in older texts. So [SPELLING] for that? It's technically correct in British English historically, so maybe not an error.

Repetition: The text repeats some ideas, like the distinction between the Church of England and Rome, but that's for emphasis, not unnecessary repetition. Maybe [REPEITITION] but not sure if it's a fluency issue.

Clarity: Despite formal language, the arguments are clearly presented. Transitions between paragraphs are smooth, like moving from introduction to chapter I.

Possible issues: 
1. Capitalization in "IT" at the start of the sentence. If it's not a title, that's a spelling error. But given the structure, maybe it's acceptable as a chapter start.
2. "connexion" vs "connection" – but acceptable in historical context.
3. Long sentences might affect readability, but they're grammatically correct. So maybe [SYNTAX] for sentence complexity, but according to the scale, score 5 allows for minimal issues. Since the text is clear and natural despite length, maybe no deduction.

So, are there any actual fluency issues? The text seems highly fluent. The only possible point is the capital "IT", but if it's a stylistic choice for the chapter, not an error. "Connexion" is variant spelling. No grammar errors spotted.

Thus, Fluency Issues might be empty. Then the score would be 5. But need to be sure. Let me check again.

Another point: "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." The repeated "or" could be slightly awkward, but it's clear. Maybe minor [SYNTAX], but not enough to deduct. 

Given the criteria, score 5 is for "Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues." This text fits. So final score 5.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 5
