Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to grammar, syntax, lexicon, etc.

Starting with the title: "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered". That's a long title with a colon and a dash. Maybe a bit cumbersome, but not a fluency issue per se.

Looking at the first paragraph: "On the principle of “first know you are right, then go ahead,” I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The quote seems correctly used. The sentence structure is a bit old-fashioned but clear. Maybe "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" – "reasonable thing of it" is a bit awkward. Should be "reasonable confidence in it" or similar. That's a LEXICON issue.

Next, "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" – "CHAPTER" capitalized oddly. Maybe a formatting error, but in the text, it's presented as part of the newspaper name. Not sure if that's an issue. Maybe SYNTAX if it's a typo.

In the second paragraph: "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" might be unnecessary, but it's stylistic. "the antldiluvians" – typo, should be "antediluvians". SPELLING error. 

Later: "how mankind corrupted themselves" – should be "themselves" or "himself"? Wait, "mankind" is singular, so "himself". GRAMMAR error. 

"...and his family, no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent;" – "any one" should be "anyone". SPELLING. 

"...the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time..." – "to the present time" is a bit formal but okay. 

Further down: "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some..." – "has been opening" is a bit awkward. Maybe "has gradually become apparent". LEXICON. 

"...the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place." – "finger of time" is a metaphor, acceptable. 

In the discovery part: "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery" – "admirirg" is a typo for "admiring". SPELLING. 

"...counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled..." – The colon after "Eden" might be better as a comma or rephrased for flow. SYNTAX. 

"...the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." – "altogether" is a bit informal here. 

"...used, occasionally to say to my friends, This is the garden of Eden." – Missing article: "This is the Garden of Eden." Capitalization? Not sure if that's an issue here. 

In the next section: "Since I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while some have mocked, others are becoming impressed..." – "commenced to publish" is a bit formal but okay. "are becoming impressed" is a progressive tense, which is fine. 

"...Where would a scientest place the first pair..." – "scientest" should be "scientist". SPELLING. 

"...to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth?" – The sentence structure is complex but understandable. Maybe a bit convoluted. 

"...Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth..." – "money mineral wealth" is unclear. Should be "monetary" or "mineral wealth" without "money". LEXICON. 

Later: "...easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream." – Complex sentence with multiple clauses. A bit hard to follow, but not a major error. 

In the biblical analysis part: "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river..." – The dashes are used oddly, maybe for emphasis but disrupt flow. SYNTAX. 

"...answers to our “Father of Waters.”" – Quotation marks around "Father of Waters
