Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to grammar, syntax, lexicon, etc.

Looking at the text, the first thing I notice is the archaic language. Words like "thoroughly satisfied," "veritable," and phrases like "on the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead'" suggest it's from the 19th century. That's not an issue per se, but the overall structure and sentence complexity might affect fluency.

There are long, winding sentences. For example, the first paragraph after the title has multiple clauses without clear transitions. This could make it hard to follow. Also, repeated phrases like "Come and see!" might be intentional for emphasis but could feel repetitive.

Checking for grammar and syntax errors: I see some missing articles ("at the head of the stream" should be "at the head of a stream"), incorrect prepositions ("located midway between the hanging garden and the opposite wall" is a bit unclear), and inconsistent verb tenses ("have related" and "believe" in the same paragraph). There's also a part where the text seems disjointed, like "Now, will any one believe us? 'Come and see!' Dr. Warner and all." The punctuation here is odd, with a quote that doesn't flow well.

Lexical issues: Some word choices are outdated or overly formal ("antideluvians," "mound-builders"), which might confuse modern readers. There's also repetition of "garden" and "Eden" excessively, which, while thematic, contributes to redundancy.

Sentence structure varies a lot. Some are simple, others are very complex with multiple embedded clauses. For example, "The scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description..." is a bit awkwardly phrased. The text also mixes poetic descriptions with factual claims, which can disrupt the flow.

Transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt. The shift from describing the garden's beauty to discussing geological age or Dr. Warren's theories feels disconnected without smooth transitions.

Despite these issues, the text is mostly readable. The author's enthusiasm and descriptive power are clear, even if the style is antiquated. The main deductions would be for frequent complex sentences, some grammatical errors, outdated vocabulary, and lack of clear transitions in places.

So, categorizing the issues:
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors like missing articles, tense inconsistencies.
- [LEXICON] Archaic and overly formal vocabulary.
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs/topics.
- [REPEITITIVENESS] Repeated phrases without variation.

The fluency score would be around 3.5. The text is generally readable but has noticeable issues that interrupt the flow. It's more fluent than not, but the cumulative effect of the problems brings it down from a higher score.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures with excessive embedded clauses.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent tense usage).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("antediluvians," "veritable") and overly formal tone.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between poetic descriptions, factual claims, and rhetorical appeals.  
- [REPEITITIVENESS] Frequent repetition of phrases ("Come and see!") without contextual variation.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
