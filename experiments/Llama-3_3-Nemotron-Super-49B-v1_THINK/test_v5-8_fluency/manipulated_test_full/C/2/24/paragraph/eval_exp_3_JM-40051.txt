Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. Fluency here includes grammar, syntax, lexicon, clarity, etc. The text is quite long, so I need to go through it carefully.

First, I'll read through the text to get a sense of the overall structure and any obvious issues. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. The author is arguing that a specific location in the US is the Garden of Eden, citing biblical descriptions and geographical features.

Looking at grammar and syntax: There are some long, convoluted sentences. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" might be unnecessary, causing a slight pause. Also, "evidently" feels a bit forced here. Another example: "And as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was;" — the structure here is a bit awkward, maybe missing a conjunction.

Spelling: I noticed "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians." Also, "admirirg" instead of "admiring." There's "utilized" used correctly, but maybe "used" would be simpler. "Veritable" is used multiple times; while correct, it's somewhat repetitive.

Lexicon: The vocabulary is mostly formal and correct, but some words like "euphony" and "veritable" are used frequently, which might make the text less accessible. Also, "sensibly impressed" is a bit formal but not incorrect.

Clarity and structure: The text jumps between different topics—describing the location, responding to critics, citing other works. Transitions could be smoother. For example, the shift from describing the garden's features to discussing Dr. Warren's theory feels abrupt. The author repeats the invitation "Come and see!" multiple times, which, while emphatic, becomes repetitive.

Other issues: There are modern terms like "data stream," "holographic map," "tablet," "smartwatch," and "smart bulb" inserted into an otherwise 19th-century styled text. These anachronisms disrupt the fluency and consistency of the writing style.

Now, categorizing the issues:

- GRAMMAR: Comma placement, sentence structure.
- SPELLING: Typos like "antldiluvians", "admirirg".
- LEXICON: Repetitive vocabulary, slightly archaic terms.
- STRUCTURE: Abrupt transitions, repetitive phrases.
- CLARITY: Complex sentences, anachronistic terms.

For the score, considering the criteria: The text is generally readable but has multiple issues. It's not highly fluent (so not 5), but not completely unintelligible (so not 1). The frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and anachronisms suggest a score around 3. However, the text's complexity and the fact that some sections are clear might push it to 3.5. But given the numerous distractions from fluency, maybe 3 is more accurate.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Comma placement (e.g., "He, evidently") and awkward sentence structures (e.g., "And as the country...").  
- [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg").  
- [LEXICON] Repetitive formal vocabulary (e.g., "veritable," "euphony").  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., transitioning between geography and criticism).  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and anachronistic modern terms (e.g., "data stream," "smartwatch").  
- [STYLE] Archaisms ("thou," poetic flourishes) clash with modern slang ("you will lose your spirit of doubting").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
