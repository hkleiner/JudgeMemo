Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to understand what fluency entails here: grammatical correctness, non-repetitiveness, alignment with common English usage, and clear meanings.

Looking at the text, it's a 19th-century theological treatise. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. I notice long, complex sentences which might affect readability. For example, the first paragraph has sentences with multiple clauses. While grammatically correct, they could be considered cumbersome for modern readers.

Checking for grammatical errors: The text seems mostly error-free, but there are some constructions that, while correct, are less common today. For instance, "IT is a very easy thing..." uses uppercase "IT" which is stylistic but not incorrect. However, consistency in capitalization might be an issue in some places, but I don't see major errors.

Repetition: The author repeats certain points, like the distinction between the sign and the thing signified, but in a theological context, some repetition for emphasis is expected. It's not excessively repetitive but could be seen as somewhat verbose.

Common English usage: The vocabulary is formal and includes terms like "thus," "whence," "wherefore," which are less common now. This might make the text less fluent for contemporary readers, but it's appropriate for its time.

Clarity: Despite the formal tone, the structure is logical. Each chapter and section builds on the previous, with clear headings. However, the dense, complex sentences might interrupt the flow for some readers.

Considering the scale: A score of 4 indicates mostly fluent with minor issues. The text's main issues are archaic language and complex sentence structure, which are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. A score of 4.5 might be considered if the issues were very minor, but the archaism and complexity are somewhat distracting. Hence, I think 4 is appropriate.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., lengthy compound sentences with multiple subordinate clauses). - [LEXICON] Formal, outdated vocabulary (e.g., "whence," "wherefore," "thou"). - [CLARITY] Occasional redundancy in reiterating distinctions (e.g., sign vs. thing signified).  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
