Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text's fluency based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, or other fluency aspects.

Looking at the text, it's a 19th-century religious treatise. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. I notice words like "wheresoever," "thou," and "thee" which are outdated but not incorrect for the time period. However, the main issue might be with sentence structure. Some sentences are very long and complex, which could affect readability. For example, the sentence starting "It is my own belief that they do not..." has multiple clauses and might be hard to follow.

Checking for grammar errors: I don't see obvious mistakes like subject-verb agreement issues or incorrect tense usage. The author uses commas appropriately, but the lengthy sentences might cause fluency problems. There's also some repetition, like "the Church of England" being mentioned frequently without variation, but that's common in such texts for emphasis.

Spelling seems correct given the era. No typos spotted. Syntax is mostly sound, though the complex sentences could interrupt flow. Lexicon is appropriate but formal, which might make it less accessible to modern readers.

Considering the criteria, a score of 4 seems right. The text is mostly fluent with minor issues from long sentences and archaic language. These don't disrupt readability much but are noticeable. So, labeling the issues under [SYNTAX] for sentence complexity and [LEXICON] for formality. The final score would be 4.0.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences impair readability. - [LEXICON] Formally archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "wheresoever," "thou") may challenge modern comprehension. - [STRUCTURE] Repetitive phrasing ("the Church of England") without variation.  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
