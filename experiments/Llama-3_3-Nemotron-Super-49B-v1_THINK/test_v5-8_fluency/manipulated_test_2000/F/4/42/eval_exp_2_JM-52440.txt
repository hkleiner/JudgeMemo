Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, or other fluency aspects.

Starting with the first chapter, I notice some subject-verb agreement errors. For example, "they, and they only, am the true expositors" should be "are". Also, "a blind consent is blindly give" should be "given". These are clear grammar mistakes.

Looking at the verb tenses, there are inconsistencies. The text switches between past and present tense in places like "was supposed to had been settle" which should be "was supposed to have been settled". The use of "was" in places where "were" is correct, like "those who was loyal" should be "were".

There are also some awkward phrasings. For instance, "it would be found to consisted" should be "consisted of". Repetitive phrases like "as far as I can understand them" could be more concise. 

Spelling seems okay, but there's a typo in "most bless Saviour" which should be "blessed". 

Syntax issues include sentences that are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the paragraph starting "The point at issue..." is very long and complex. 

Lexical choices could be improved. Words like "endeavoured" are formal but repeated; maybe "attempted" would vary the language. 

Now, categorizing these issues: [GRAMMAR] for subject-verb, tense, and verb form errors; [SYNTAX] for long sentences; [LEXICON] for word choice and repetition; [SPELLING] for the typo.

For the fluency score, the text is mostly readable but has frequent errors. It's not highly fluent (so not 5), but not completely unintelligible either. The mistakes are noticeable and interrupt flow, so maybe a 2.5? But some parts are clear, so maybe 3? Wait, the scale says 3 is "generally readable with multiple issues interrupting flow". Given the number of errors but overall structure being understandable, I think 2.5 is more accurate because the errors are frequent enough to cause difficulty, even if the main points can be grasped with effort.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "they... am", "was blindly give", "the groundwork... am", "those who was")  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was supposed to had been settle", "would was confounded")  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "was directed", "was examined", "was introduced")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences disrupting clarity (e.g., paragraphs in CHAPTER I)  
- [LEXICON] Repetitive or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "endeavoured", "was not my business now")  
- [SPELLING] Minor typo ("most bless" instead of "most blessed")  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **2.5**
