Okay, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text based on the given criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, lexicon, or other fluency-related problems.

First, I notice that there are several instances where the verb tense seems inconsistent. For example, "he certainly write no longer" should be "wrote". That's a grammar issue. Also, "Youth will was served" doesn't make sense grammatically; maybe it should be "Youth would be served". 

There are also subject-verb agreement problems, like "Mr. Bud and Mr. Drood were... they were 'fast friends'". The pronoun "they" refers to two people, so it should be "were" but maybe the sentence structure is a bit awkward. Wait, no, "they were" is correct here. Hmm, maybe not an issue. Wait, looking again: "Mr. Bud and Mr. Drood were 'fast friends and old college companions.'" That seems okay. Maybe another example: "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements..." The phrase "combined with" might be a bit awkward; perhaps "incorporated" would be better, but it's not a major error.

Spelling mistakes? I see "outwear" instead of "worn out" or "exhausted". "Ominously bad health" is correct, but "outwear by the strain" should be "worn out". Also, "abandon" should be "abandoned". "We may thought" instead of "might have thought". "Opiumed" isn't a word; it should be "took opium". "Babblinged" is incorrect; it's "babbling". "Saw" instead of "see" in "as far as we are allowed to saw". "Make" instead of "made" in "make valuable suggestions". "Was" instead of "were" in several places, like "the villain was all that melodrama could desired" – should be "could have desired". 

Syntax issues: Some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the paragraph starting "In April, 1869..." has multiple clauses that might benefit from simpler structure. Also, "If she had been dealing in opium for ten years... she had am very disreputable for twenty-six years" – the "had am" is a clear error, should be "had been". 

Lexical choices: "Saucy school-girl" might be a bit informal for academic writing, but it's not a major issue. "Fared worse" in the context might not be the best choice, but understandable. 

Repetition: The text mentions "opium" multiple times, but that's part of the topic, so not an issue. 

Overall, the text has several grammatical errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few spelling mistakes. However, despite these, the text is generally readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So, according to the scale, a score of 4 would be "mostly fluent with minor issues", but since there are multiple grammatical errors and some awkwardness, maybe 3.5? Wait, the scale says score 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues interrupt flow". Score 4 allows minor issues that are noticeable but don't disrupt readability. Let me count the errors again. There are at least 10 grammatical/spelling errors, which might push it towards 3.5. But the text is still mostly understandable. Maybe 3.5 is appropriate because while there are several errors, the overall structure is clear, and the reader can follow with some effort.

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense (e.g., "he certainly write") and subject-verb errors (e.g., "We may thought"). - [SPELLING] Typos like "outwear" (should be "worn out"), "babblinged" (babbling), "opiumed" (took opium). - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "combined with some of the elements"), overly complex sentences. - [LEXICON] Informal tone in academic context (e.g., "saucy school-girl").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
