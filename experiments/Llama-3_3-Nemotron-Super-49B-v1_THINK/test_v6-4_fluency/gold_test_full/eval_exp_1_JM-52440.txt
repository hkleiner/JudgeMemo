Okay, let me try to figure out how to evaluate this text based on the given criteria. First, the task is to assess the fluency of the text, which includes syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The scale goes from 1 (unintelligible) to 5 (highly fluent).

Looking at the provided text, it's a historical theological treatise from the Church of England. The language is formal and somewhat archaic, which might affect readability for modern readers. But fluency here is about how smoothly it reads despite that.

First, check for grammar and syntax issues. The sentences are long and complex, with multiple clauses. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that starts with "IT is a very easy thing..." which uses an archaic capitalization style (though that's a stylistic choice, not an error). The structure is mostly correct, but the complexity might make it hard to follow at times.

Spelling: Assuming it's from an older text, there might be archaic spellings, but the user hasn't indicated any actual errors. So probably no spelling issues.

Word choice and phrasing: The vocabulary is formal and includes terms like "supremely," "consecration," which are appropriate for the topic but might be less common. However, the text uses clear and precise language, even if dense.

Punctuation seems correct, with proper use of commas, semicolons, and periods, even in long sentences.

Now, considering the fluency scale. A score of 5 requires minimal to no errors and natural phrasing. This text has no errors but is quite dense and archaic. A score of 4 would be mostly fluent with minor issues. The main issue here is the complexity and formality, which might make it less fluent for some readers, but given the context (a theological treatise), it's appropriate. The text is well-structured, and while it's challenging, it's readable with attention. Therefore, the fluency is high but not perfect due to its formal and somewhat outdated style. So a score of 4.5 might be appropriate, as it's mostly fluent but has minor issues in readability due to complexity.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Complex, archaic sentence structures may impede readability. - [LEXICON] Formal, outdated vocabulary (e.g., "whomsoever," "thou") reduces modern fluency.  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
