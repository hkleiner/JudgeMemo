Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite lengthy, so I need to go through it carefully. First, I'll look for fluency issues like grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing problems.

Starting with the title: "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-" — the punctuation here is a bit odd with the hyphen and colon. Maybe a formatting issue, but not a major fluency problem.

In the first paragraph, "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" — "reasonable thing of it" is unclear. Should be "reasonable confidence" or something similar. That's a lexical issue.

Next, "antldiluvians" — spelling mistake, should be "antediluvians" [SPELLING]. Also, "he simply stated the principal facts" — "principal" should be "principle" here? Wait, no, "principal" as main facts. Wait, no, "principal" refers to main, "principle" is a rule. So maybe correct, but not sure. Maybe a minor point.

"the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was;" — the sentence structure is a bit awkward. Maybe missing a comma or unclear antecedent.

Later, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place." — "finger of time" is an unusual metaphor, but not necessarily a fluency issue unless it's confusing.

In the part where the author describes standing on the hanging garden, "admirirg" — typo, should be "admiring" [SPELLING].

"Where would a scientest place the first pair" — "scientest" should be "scientist" [SPELLING].

"...easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed;" — a bit wordy, but flows okay.

Further down, "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," — this paragraph seems garbled. Words are out of order, doesn't make sense. Major syntax and coherence issue [SYNTAX/COHERENCE].

Later, "possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed." — completely incoherent. Words are jumbled [SYNTAX/COHERENCE].

Other issues: Repetitive descriptions, like mentioning the beauty multiple times, which might make the text less fluent due to redundancy. However, the main problems are the spelling errors, a couple of unclear sentences, and those two severely garbled paragraphs which disrupt fluency significantly.

Now, categorizing the issues. The major ones are the two paragraphs with scrambled sentences. Those would be under [SYNTAX] or [COHERENCE]. The spelling mistakes are [SPELLING]. Some lexical choices or awkward phrasing could be [LEXICON] or [SYNTAX].

For the score: The text is generally readable, but those two paragraphs are really bad. However, the rest has some minor issues but is mostly understandable. So between 3 and 4. Since the major issues are in specific parts but the overall flow is maintained elsewhere, maybe 3.5. But the garbled parts are quite disruptive. Maybe 3, because multiple significant issues interrupting flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "scientest").  
- [SYNTAX/COHERENCE] Severe sentence fragmentation and incoherence (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...", "possession as been Christians...").  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "reasonable thing of it," "finger of time").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
