Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, it's a formal, old-fashioned style, probably from the 19th century given the structure and vocabulary. The language is complex with long sentences. Let me check for grammar errors. The sentences are mostly correct grammatically, but some are very long and convoluted, which might affect readability. For example, the sentence starting with "That the material food..." seems disjointed and hard to follow. There's a part where the text says "the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This part looks like a jumbled mix of words, possibly a typesetting error or a missing section. That's definitely a fluency issue under syntax or maybe even structure.

Spelling: I didn't notice any obvious spelling mistakes, but there might be archaic spellings which are acceptable. Punctuation seems mostly correct, with appropriate commas and periods, though some sentences could benefit from clearer punctuation to enhance flow.

Lexicon and phrasing: The vocabulary is formal and somewhat outdated (e.g., "thou," "whomsoever"), but that's consistent with the style. However, the repeated use of complex phrases and the dense theological jargon might make it hard for some readers to follow, even if it's correct. 

The main issues I see are the extremely long, complicated sentences and the jumbled paragraph mentioned earlier. Those would cause point deductions. The text is generally readable but with notable challenges due to structure and clarity. 

According to the scale, a score of 3 would mean "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity." The jumbled text is a significant structural issue, and the long sentences, while grammatically correct, contribute to lower fluency. So I'd rate it a 3.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Extremely long, convoluted sentence structures impede readability (e.g., "That the material food...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Apparent typesetting/error in paragraph with disjointed, repetitive phrases ("the the of two perfectly...").  
- [PHRASING] Overly complex, archaic vocabulary and sentence constructions (e.g., "whomsoever," "whereby as by an instrument").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
