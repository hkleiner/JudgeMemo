Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any fluency issues related to grammar, syntax, spelling, lexicon, etc.

Starting with the text, it's a historical or theological piece from the Church of England. The language is formal and somewhat archaic, which might explain some constructions, but there are noticeable errors. 

Looking at grammar first. I see subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "those who was loyal" should be "those who were loyal." There's also "it would be found to consisted" which should be "consisted of." Tense inconsistencies, like "was examined" instead of "is examined" in some places. 

Syntax problems: Some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the paragraph starting with "The issues at stake..." has multiple clauses that could be broken up for clarity. 

Spelling: I didn't notice any outright spelling mistakes, but there might be archaic spellings that are correct in context, like "connexion" instead of "connection." 

Lexicon: Word choice seems appropriate for the period, but some repetition, like using "was" excessively in places where "were" is correct. 

Punctuation: Mostly correct, but could benefit from more commas for clarity in long sentences. 

Now, categorizing the issues. The main ones are grammar (subject-verb, tense), syntax (sentence structure), and some lexicon (word choice repetitions). 

For the score, the text is generally readable but has multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. It doesn't reach a 4 because the errors are frequent enough to interrupt flow. A 3 seems right because while you can understand it, there are noticeable issues. 

Checking the scale: Score 3 is for "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity." That fits. 

Make sure to list the most serious problems with their categories. Avoid explanations, just bullet points. Then the final score.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "those who was loyal," "the point was supposed to had been settle").  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was examined" instead of "is examined").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multi-clause paragraphs lacking clear punctuation).  
- [LEXICON] Repetitive or archaic word choices (e.g., "was directed," "woulded").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
