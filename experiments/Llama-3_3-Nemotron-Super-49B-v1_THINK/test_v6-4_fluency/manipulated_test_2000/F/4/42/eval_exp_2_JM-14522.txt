Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text provided is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. First, I need to check for fluency issues like grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. 

Starting with the first chapter, I notice some verb tense inconsistencies. For example, "when they come to discuss terms" should be "came". Then, "had felt it his duty" is correct, but later "was frightened into a fit, from which she never really recover" – "recover" should be "recovered". 

There are also subject-verb agreements. Like "the ghost has am see" – that's a clear mistake; should be "has been seen". In the Minister's dialogue, "we'dded have it" is probably a typo for "would have". 

In the description of Mrs. Otis, "which he never ceased to regretted" – double past tense; should be "regret". The twins section has "who am usually called" – should be "are". 

Later, "Mr. Otis have telegraphed" – subject-verb error, should be "had telegraphed". "The air was delicate with the scent" is a bit awkward; maybe "filled" instead of "was delicate". 

In the housekeeper's dialogue, "blood had am spilt" – another "has" error. Washington's response has "woulded did it" – incorrect; "would have done". 

Chapter II has "the whole family were now quite interested" – subject-verb, should be "was". "Mr. Otis began to suspect that he have been" – tense issue, "had been". "The library have been lock up" – "had been locked". 

At the end, "a door is flung open" – tense inconsistency, should be "was flung". 

Despite these errors, the text is mostly readable. The issues are frequent but not crippling. So, the score would be around 3, considering multiple errors but overall readability.
