Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency: grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc.

Looking at the text, the first thing that stands out is the structure. There are multiple sections that seem unrelated. For example, the beginning talks about the Garden of Eden, then there's a part about Jasper and Rosa, followed by a description of a housekeeper, a glass partition in an office, and finally a passage about George Stransom. These abrupt changes without clear transitions are a big fluency problem. Each section has its own style and topic, making the text disjointed.

Next, checking for grammar and syntax. In the first part, sentences are mostly structured correctly, but there are some long, convoluted sentences. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere..." is a bit complex but manageable. However, there are spots with awkward phrasing, like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." The phrase "finger of time" is a bit odd and might confuse readers.

Spelling errors are present. I noticed "antldiluvians" should be "antideluvians," and "admirirg" instead of "admiring." Also, "commistes" isn't a wordâ€”maybe "commits" or another term was intended. These errors, though not numerous, detract from fluency.

Lexicon issues: Some word choices are archaic or less common, like "profound mystery," "antideluvians," which might make the text harder for modern readers to follow smoothly. The mix of biblical references and modern locations (like Mississippi River) could also cause disjointedness.

The later sections introduce characters and scenes without introduction, which disrupts the flow. For example, the part about Jasper and Rosa seems completely out of context. The text jumps between different narratives without connectors, making it hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the individual sections, when considered alone, have some coherence. The writing isn't completely unintelligible, but the overall structure and transitions are poor. The errors are noticeable but not overwhelming in each section. 

Considering the evaluation scale: A score of 3 means "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow." Given the disjointed structure, spelling mistakes, and some awkward phrasing, but still manageable readability in parts, a 3 seems appropriate. The text has multiple issues but isn't entirely incomprehensible.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated sections (e.g., Garden of Eden, Jasper/Rosa, office/glass partition, George Stransom) with no transitional coherence.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man...").  
- [SPELLING] Errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "commistes").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic/less common vocabulary ("antideluvians," "profound mystery").  
- [FLOW] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
