Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any fluency issues. Fluency here includes grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, the first thing I notice is the long, winding sentences. For example, the opening sentence after the title is quite complex and hard to follow. There are also some archaic phrases like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians) and "providentially named," which might affect readability. 

Checking for grammar and spelling errors: I see "antldiluvians" missing an 'e', "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" should be "dimensions", "scientest" is a typo for "scientist", "Bridtish" instead of "British", "consitutes" should be "constitutes", and "jageed" which I'm not sure aboutâ€”maybe "jagged"? Also, "hightest" should be "highest". These are definite spelling issues.

Syntax problems: Some sentences are structured awkwardly. For example, "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent;" feels a bit clumsy. The use of semicolons and commas might not always be correct, leading to run-on sentences or unclear pauses.

Word choice and phrasing: Words like "veritable" and "euphony" are formal but okay. However, phrases like "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" could be clearer. Repetitions like "our garden" repeatedly might make the text less fluent.

Punctuation: There are places with multiple exclamation marks or abrupt transitions without clear paragraph breaks, like the shift after "THE AUTHOR. A mobile hotspot activated." which seems out of place.

Considering the scale: A score of 5 is highly fluent with minimal errors. This text has several spelling errors, some grammatical issues, and awkward phrasing, so it can't be a 5. A 4 would be mostly fluent with minor issues, but the errors here are noticeable. A 3 means multiple issues interrupting flow. Given the list of problems, especially the spelling mistakes and long sentences, I think it's a 3. The text is generally readable but has enough errors to distract.
