Okay, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text based on the given criteria. Let's start by reading through the text to identify any issues with fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, the text is quite long and written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. The author uses complex sentences with multiple clauses, which can make it hard to follow. For example, sentences are very long and convoluted, like the one starting with "When God formed the earth..." That's a problem for fluency because it's confusing.

Looking at grammar and syntax: There are places where the sentence structure is awkward. For instance, "Nineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the 'eastward bank,' nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site, Trempealeau..." The use of "nestles, and spreads out" seems a bit off. Also, missing articles or incorrect prepositions, like "on the eastward bank" instead of "on the eastern bank."

Spelling errors: I noticed "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "devoid" (devoid of), "moun" (mount), "recieved" (received), and "enviroment" (environment). These are clear spelling mistakes.

Word choice and phrasing: Some words are outdated or overly formal, like "whilst" instead of "while," which might not be common in modern writing. Phrases like "O what a delightful home!" feel a bit forced or overly dramatic.

Punctuation: There are inconsistent uses of commas and semicolons. For example, long lists without proper punctuation, or commas where semicolons might be better for clarity.

The text also has repetitive phrases, such as "Come and see!" repeated multiple times, which disrupts the flow. Additionally, there are abrupt transitions between ideas without clear connections.

Despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The author's enthusiasm and descriptive language are engaging, but the numerous errors and complexities bring the score down. 

Considering the evaluation scale: A score of 3 means "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity." Given the frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and spelling mistakes, but the text still being understandable, a score of 3 seems appropriate. However, the density of errors might push it to 2.5, but since the reader can still comprehend the main points despite the issues, 3 is more fitting.
