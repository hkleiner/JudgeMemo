Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text and provide a score from 1 to 5 with half-points. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any fluency issues. The criteria include syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, it's quite long and written in an old style, probably from the 19th century given the language and references. The author is arguing that a specific location in the U.S. is the Garden of Eden. 

Starting with grammar and syntax: There are some long, convoluted sentences. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that's a bit hard to follow because of its length and structure. Words like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring) indicate spelling mistakes. 

Spelling errors are present, like "dimentionions" instead of dimensions, "admirirg", "antldiluvians", "supposely" (supposedly), "providentially" (correct but used excessively), "commencement" (maybe intended but formal), "utilize" (formal but acceptable). 

Word choice and phrasing: The author uses very formal, somewhat archaic language, which might make it less fluent for modern readers. Words like "veritable", "supposely", "providentially" are formal but not incorrect. However, phrases like "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me" are a bit stilted.

Punctuation: There are places with missing or excessive commas, making sentences hard to parse. For example, "And from thence,——it was which means long river..." has an em dash without clear purpose.

Syntax issues include sentence structures that are overly complex. For example, "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible..." has a comma splice and awkward phrasing.

Despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The author's main points come through, even if the language is antiquated and there are minor errors. The score should reflect that while there are multiple minor issues, they don't make the text unintelligible. 

Comparing to the scale: 
- Score 5: Highly fluent, minimal errors. This text has too many errors.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues. The text is mostly clear but has noticeable flaws.
- Score 3: Multiple issues interrupting flow. The errors here are frequent but don't completely block understanding.

Given the frequent but not crippling issues, I'd lean towards a 3.5. The text is readable but with enough problems to deduct from fluency. However, the archaic style might not be an error per se, just less fluent for modern readers. But since the task is to judge fluency as per current standards, the archaic tone would affect the score.

Wait, but the evaluation is based on the defined criteria, which includes how it reads now. So even if it's old, the fluency is judged on modern readability. The errors in spelling, grammar, and complex sentences would bring it down. However, the author's consistent style, even if formal, might mitigate some points. 

Balancing, I think 3.5 is appropriate. Multiple issues but still generally readable.
