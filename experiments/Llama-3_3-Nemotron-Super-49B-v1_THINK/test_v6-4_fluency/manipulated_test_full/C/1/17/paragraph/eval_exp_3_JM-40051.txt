Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully to spot any issues related to fluency—like grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is quite long, so this might take some time.

Starting with the title: "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-" Hmm, the hyphen at the start is unusual. Maybe that's a typo or formatting error. Not a huge issue but worth noting.

Reading the first paragraph: "On the principle of “first know you are right, then go ahead,” I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The quotation seems out of context. Is that a real quote? Maybe missing attribution. Also, "have ventured to publish it" – "ventured" is a bit formal but okay.

Further down: "antldiluvians" – typo, should be "antediluvians". That's a spelling error. Then, "he simply stated the principal facts" – "principal" vs "principle". Here, "principal" is correct as it refers to main facts. Wait, no, "principal" can mean main, but in some contexts, "principle" is a rule. Wait, the sentence says "stated the principal facts" – yes, "principal" here is correct as the main facts. So maybe not an error.

Later: "the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was;" – missing punctuation maybe. The sentence structure is a bit convoluted. Could be a syntax issue.

In the next paragraph: "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent;" – "has been opening" is a bit awkward. Maybe "has been dawning" or similar. Not a major error but affects fluency.

"the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place." – "finger of time" is a metaphor, a bit poetic but acceptable. However, clarity might suffer for some readers.

The author mentions standing on the hanging garden and counting rivers. Then, "admirirg" – typo, should be "admiring". Another spelling error.

Later: "Where would a scientest place the first pair" – "scientest" should be "scientist". Another typo.

"our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth," – "money mineral wealth" is unclear. Maybe "monetary" or just "mineral wealth". Ambiguous wording.

The text frequently uses phrases like "Come and see!" which are repetitive and might disrupt flow. Also, there are long, winding sentences. For example: "This vast area, Eden,—containing the most fertile and habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the most industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the world; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all lands,—contains “The heart of the New World,” the “Land of Promise,” in this Christian United States of America." – multiple clauses without clear separation, making it hard to follow.

There's a mix of biblical references and geographical descriptions, which might cause confusion without proper transitions. For example, switching between discussing the Garden of Eden and describing specific locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota without clear links.

Spelling mistakes like "admirirg", "scientest", "antldiluvians" are present. Grammar issues include subject-verb agreement in some places, like "the country ... was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was" – unclear structure.

The text also has inconsistent tone, veering from scholarly to persuasive and sometimes sarcastic (e.g., comments about Dr. Warren). This inconsistency might affect fluency.

In terms of syntax, many sentences are complex and overly long, lacking clear punctuation to guide the reader. For example: "Now, will any one believe us? “Come and see!” Dr. Warner and all. Take this description in your hand, read, and look, and like the “Queen of Sheba,” you will lose your “spirit of doubting,” and say: “It was a true report, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the one half of its greatness was not told.”" – abrupt shifts and missing articles ("Dr. Warner and all" should be "Dr. Warren and all").

There are also abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For instance, the text jumps from describing the garden's features to discussing a book by Moritz Engel without a clear connection.

Despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The author's enthusiasm and detailed descriptions are engaging, but the numerous errors and complex sentence structures hinder smooth reading. The score should reflect that it's mostly readable but with noticeable problems.
