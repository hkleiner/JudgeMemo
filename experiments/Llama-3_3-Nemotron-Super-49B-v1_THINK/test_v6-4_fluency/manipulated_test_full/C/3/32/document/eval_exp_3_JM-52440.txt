Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, it's a formal, theological piece from the 19th century, given the style and references (e.g., Church of England documents, historical events like the Reformation). The language is complex with long sentences, archaic vocabulary ("thou," "thee"), and dense theological arguments. 

Starting with grammar and syntax: The sentences are very long and convoluted. For example, the first chapter has sentences that span multiple lines, making them hard to follow. While grammatically correct in structure, their length and complexity hinder readability. There's also some repetition in ideas, like the constant distinction between the sacrament's outward and inward parts, which, while clear, might feel repetitive.

Spelling and punctuation seem okay for the most part, but there are some missing articles ("a thing" instead of "the Church") which might be typos or placeholders. These disrupt the flow slightly.

Word choice and phrasing are formal and sometimes archaic ("thus," "whence," "wherefore"), which suits the historical context but affects modern readability. The text assumes a high level of theological knowledge, using terms like "transubstantiation" without explanation, which could confuse less familiar readers.

Despite these, the text is generally clear in its arguments. The author structures the content logically, referencing specific articles and documents in an organized manner. However, the density of the content and the outdated language make it challenging for fluent reading. 

Fluency issues here are mainly due to sentence complexity, archaic language, and some minor errors (like "a thing"). These don't make the text unintelligible but require careful reading. According to the scale, a score of 3 seems appropriate: the text is generally readable but has multiple issues interrupting the flow.
