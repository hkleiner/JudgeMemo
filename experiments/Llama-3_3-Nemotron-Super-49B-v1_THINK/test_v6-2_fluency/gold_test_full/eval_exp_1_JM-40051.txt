Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long, so I need to focus on fluency issues as per the criteria. First, I'll read through the text to identify any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, or structural problems.

Starting with the first part, the title seems okay. The opening sentence mentions "the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead'"—should be "principle" or "principles"? Maybe a minor point. Then, "have ventured to publish it"—seems correct. 

In the next paragraph, "when God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The capitalization of "He" is correct here as it's a direct reference to God. The sentence structure is a bit complex but understandable.

Further down: "the antldiluvians"—typo, should be "antediluvians". That's a spelling error. Then, "how mankind corrupted themselves"—subject-verb agreement; should be "how mankind corrupted itself" since mankind is singular. 

Later, "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat"—"plat" might be a less common term, but contextually it refers to a plot of land, so maybe acceptable. "admirirg" is a typo for "admiring".

In the sentence: "Where would a scientest place the first pair..."—typo, "scientist". Also, "to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth?" The structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe "from which to spread as the inhabitant of all the earth"?

The text often uses very long, winding sentences. For example, the paragraph starting with "I have related the facts..." has multiple clauses without clear separation, making it hard to follow. 

There are repetitions, like the constant invitations to "Come and see!" which, while rhetorical, might disrupt fluency. 

Checking for syntax issues: "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence..." The dash usage is inconsistent; maybe em dashes would be better. "which means long river"— abrupt transition; could use a connector.

In the section discussing the location on the Mississippi, there are detailed geographical descriptions which are clear but very lengthy. The use of terms like "eastward bank" is correct but repeated frequently.

Spelling mistakes found: "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "scientest". Grammar: "mankind corrupted themselves" (subject-verb), "have ventured to publish it" (might be better as "ventured to publish"). Syntax issues with long sentences and some awkward phrasing.

The text is mostly readable but has several minor errors and structural complexities. The author's style is somewhat archaic, with complex sentences and poetic descriptions, which might affect modern fluency but were possibly common in the era it was written.

Considering the scale: Score 4 would be mostly fluent with minor issues. Given the errors and some awkwardness but overall readability, I'd lean towards 3.5. However, the frequent grammatical errors and consistent awkward phrasing might push it to a 3. But the text's complexity and the fact that it's mostly understandable despite errors suggest a 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "mankind corrupted themselves").  
- [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "scientest").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentences disrupting flow.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic/archetypal tone and repetitive rhetorical flourishes ("Come and see!").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
