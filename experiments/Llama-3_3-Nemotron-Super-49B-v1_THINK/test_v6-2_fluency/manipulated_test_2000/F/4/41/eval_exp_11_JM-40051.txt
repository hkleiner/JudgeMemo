Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the fluency of the given text on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, considering factors like grammar, syntax, repetition, and clarity.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. The text appears to be a 19th-century style writing, possibly from the late 1800s given the language and references. The author is arguing that a specific location near the Mississippi River is the Garden of Eden. 

Looking for fluency issues: 
1. **Grammar and Syntax**: There are several grammatical errors. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians", "locayion" instead of "location", "princopak" probably meant "principal". These are clear typos or misspellings that disrupt reading. 
2. **Repetition**: Phrases like "our garden" are repeated frequently, which might make the text a bit tedious but not severely impacting fluency.
3. **Clarity and Structure**: The sentences are often long and convoluted. For instance, the paragraph starting "When God made man..." has multiple clauses that make it hard to follow. The structure jumps between biblical references and geographical descriptions without clear transitions.
4. **Spelling**: Many typos like "dkscovered", "admirirg", "prlper", "Bridtish", "inhabited" misspelled as "innabited", "investigatikn". These are frequent and noticeable.
5. **Lexical Choices**: Some word choices are archaic or awkward, like "veritable" and "euphony", but they might be intentional for the style. However, they don't hinder understanding much.

The most serious problems are the frequent spelling and grammatical errors, along with complex sentence structures that interrupt flow. While the text is mostly readable, the errors are numerous enough to distract and require some effort to comprehend. 

Considering the evaluation scale: 
- A score of 3 seems appropriate because the text has multiple grammatical and spelling issues that interrupt flow, but it's still generally readable. The structural issues and typos are noticeable and frequent, fitting the description for a score of 3.
