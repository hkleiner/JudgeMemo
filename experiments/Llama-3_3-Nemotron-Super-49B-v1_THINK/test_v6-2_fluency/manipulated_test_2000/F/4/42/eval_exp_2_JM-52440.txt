Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any fluency issues. 

Starting with the first chapter, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "IT is a very easy thing..." should probably be "It is..." with a lowercase 'i' unless it's a title, but here it's the start of a sentence. Then there are subject-verb agreement issues like "they, and they only, am the true expositors"â€”should be "are". Also, "blind consent is blindly give" should be "is given". 

In the next paragraph, "the point was supposed to had been settle" has a tense error; it should be "had been settled". There's also "those who was loyal" instead of "were". 

Moving to Chapter I, more errors appear: "our most bless Saviour" missing an 'e' in "blessed". Then "the one must not was confounded" should be "must not be confounded". The sentence structure in some parts is a bit convoluted, like the long explanation comparing the two views on the Real Presence, which might make it hard to follow. 

Looking at the Articles section, there's "beared" instead of "bear" or "pertaining to". The 27th Article discussion has "was never say to be infused" which should be "were never said". Also, "the promises... are visibly sign and seal" is missing a preposition, maybe "visibly signed and sealed". 

Despite these errors, the text is generally readable. The structure is clear with chapters and topics, and the language, although archaic, is mostly coherent. The main issues are grammatical and some spelling mistakes, but they don't make the text unintelligible. The score should reflect that it's mostly fluent but with noticeable minor issues. So a 4 might be appropriate because it's mostly fluent with minor problems that don't disrupt readability much.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "they... am", "was" instead of "were").  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "bless" instead of "blessed", "beared" instead of "bear").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the one must not was confounded").  
- [LEXICON/USAGE] Archaic language (e.g., "thus", "whilst") may slightly impede modern readability.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
