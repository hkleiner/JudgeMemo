Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, lexicon, spelling, etc.

Looking at the text, it's mostly well-written, but there are several grammatical errors. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." There are subject-verb agreement issues like "they am" instead of "they are." Tense inconsistencies pop up, such as "had felt" and "come" in the same sentence. Also, some word choices are off, like "am see" instead of "has been seen." 

I need to categorize each issue. The main categories here seem to be GRAMMAR for subject-verb, tense, and verb form errors; SPELLING for typos like "recieved"; and SYNTAX for sentence structure problems. The errors are frequent enough to cause some disruption but not so severe that the text is unintelligible. 

The scale says a score of 3 is for multiple issues that interrupt flow. Since the text is generally readable but with noticeable errors, I think a 3 is appropriate. The most serious problems are the repeated grammatical mistakes affecting clarity. 

Make sure to list the bullet points with correct labels and avoid explanations. Then assign the score based on the criteria.
