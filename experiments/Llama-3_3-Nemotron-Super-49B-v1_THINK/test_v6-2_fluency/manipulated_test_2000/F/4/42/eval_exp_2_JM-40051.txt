Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long and written in an older style, so first I need to read through it carefully to spot any fluency issues. Fluency here refers to grammar, syntax, lexicon, spelling, and overall readability.

Starting with the first paragraph, I notice "had venture to published it." That should be "ventured to publish." That's a grammar error, specifically verb tense inconsistency. Then in the next sentence, "in order to invite general inspection, and criticism." The comma before "and" is unnecessary; it should be a serial comma or omitted.

Moving on, there are several instances of subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" â€“ "has" doesn't agree with "am," which is incorrect. It should be "has been plainly pointing." Also, "I is ignorant" instead of "I was ignorant." 

There are multiple verb tense inconsistencies. Like "I commenced to publish my views" uses "commenced," which is formal but not incorrect, but combined with modern phrases, it's a bit jarring. However, the main issue is inconsistency, like "had never given it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or mighted was its proper dimentions." "Mighted" is incorrect; it should be "might have been."

Spelling mistakes are present too, such as "dimentions" (dimensions), "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "consitutes" (constitutes), "was being settled and inhabit" (inhabited). 

Syntax issues include convoluted sentences. For example, the long sentence starting with "When God made man to dwelt..." has multiple clauses that make it hard to follow. Also, "the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one know where it was;" should be "no one knew."

Lexical choices are sometimes archaic or awkward, like "veritable" (though not wrong, it's less common), "providentially named" (a bit formal), and "jageed" (probably meant "jagged").

Despite these, the text is mostly readable. The errors are frequent but not so dense that they prevent understanding. The structure is generally clear, even if sentence lengths vary greatly. The author's intent comes through, though with some effort due to the antiquated style and mistakes.

So, categorizing the issues: GRAMMAR (tense, agreement, verb forms), SPELLING (typos), SYNTAX (sentence structure, punctuation), LEXICON (word choice). The most serious are the grammar errors affecting clarity. 

For the score, since the text has multiple grammatical and spelling errors, and some structural issues, but remains generally understandable, it's between 3 and 4. The errors are noticeable and interrupt flow, so maybe 3.5. But considering the readability isn't severely impacted despite the mistakes, perhaps a 3.5 or 4. Given the frequency of errors but overall comprehensibility, I'll go with 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense (e.g., "had venture to published"), subject-verb agreement ("I is ignorant"), incorrect verb forms ("mighted was").
- [SPELLING] Errors (e.g., "dimentions", "antldiluvians", "consitutes").
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., overly complex clauses), unnecessary commas.
- [LEXICON] Archaic/archaic-sounding phrasing (e.g., "veritable", "jageed").

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
