Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, lexicology, and overall readability.

Looking at the text, the first thing that stands out is the archaic language. Words like "veritable," "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians), and phrases like "I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery" suggest an older writing style. While that's not necessarily a fluency issue, it might affect readability for modern readers.

There are several grammatical errors. For example, "antldiluvians" is likely a misspelling. In the sentence "have ventured to publish it," "have" seems out of place; it should probably be "ventured to publish it" without "have." Also, "admirirg" is a typo for "admiring." 

Syntax issues are present too. Some sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the paragraph starting with "When God made man..." has multiple clauses that aren't clearly connected. There's also inconsistent verb tense usage, like switching between past and present tense in some sections.

Lexicological issues include word choices that are less common or archaic, which might confuse readers. For example, "antideluvians" (though that's a known term, the misspelling could cause issues), "Havilah," and "jageed" (which I'm not sure is a real wordâ€”maybe "jagged"?).

There's a section near the end that seems garbled: "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to, Trempealeau..." This part is almost incomprehensible, indicating a major syntax or typing error.

Despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The author's enthusiasm and descriptive language are clear, even if the structure and some words cause difficulties. The most serious problems are the garbled sentence, grammatical errors, and archaic vocabulary. However, the text doesn't descend to being unintelligible overall. 

Considering the scale: A score of 3 seems appropriate because there are multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt flow, but the text is still mostly readable. The severe error in the garbled paragraph is a big deduction, but other parts are clearer.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Extremely convoluted sentence structure (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a...") rendering parts unintelligible.
- [GRAMMAR] Repeated grammatical errors (e.g., "have ventured to publish it," "admirirg").
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and unclear terms (e.g., "jageed," "antldiluvians").
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent tense shifts and overly long, fragmented sentences.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
