Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify any fluency issues.

Starting with the title and introduction, the text seems old-fashioned, maybe from the 19th century. The language is formal but there are some archaic expressions. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians"—that's a spelling mistake. Also, phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" are a bit awkward in modern English, which might affect fluency.

Looking at sentence structure, some sentences are very long and convoluted. For instance, the paragraph starting with "When God made man..." has multiple clauses without clear punctuation, making it hard to follow. There's also repetition, like mentioning the location between La Crosse and Winona multiple times without adding new info.

Grammar issues: "have ventured to publish it" after "having become thoroughly satisfied" feels a bit off; maybe "I have ventured" would be better. Also, "as a matter of pleasantry" is awkward. "Admirirg" is a typo for "admiring". 

In the later parts, there are mixing of poetic descriptions with factual claims, which disrupts the flow. The transition from describing the landscape to talking about snakes feels abrupt. Words like "jageed" aren't recognized—probably a typo for "jagged". 

Despite the issues, the text is mostly readable. The main problems are spelling errors, long winding sentences, some awkward phrasing, and a few grammatical mistakes. However, the overall structure is understandable, even if it's not very smooth. 

Considering the scale: A score of 3 would mean generally readable but with multiple issues interrupting flow. Score 4 is for mostly fluent with minor issues. Since there are several errors and awkwardness but it's still comprehensible, I think 3.5 is appropriate. It's between generally readable and mostly fluent. The errors are noticeable but don't make it unintelligible.
