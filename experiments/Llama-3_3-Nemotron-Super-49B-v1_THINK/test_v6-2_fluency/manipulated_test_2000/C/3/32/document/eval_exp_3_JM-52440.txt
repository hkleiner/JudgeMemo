Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, lexicology, etc.

Looking at the text, it's a formal, possibly 19th-century religious tract. The language is complex with long sentences. I notice some archaic terms like "thou" and "thee" but those might be intentional for the context. 

Checking for grammar: The sentences are mostly structured correctly, but some are very long and convoluted. For example, "IT is a very easy thing..." starts with a capital IT, which might be a typo or stylistic choice. There's a repetition of "the stuff" which seems like a placeholder or errorâ€”should be "Church" perhaps. 

Syntax issues: The lengthy sentences could impede flow. For instance, the sentence starting "The issues at stake..." has multiple clauses without clear breaks. 

Lexicon: Words like "sifting time" might be less common but fit the context. "Stuff" is definitely wrong; that's a clear error. 

Repetitions: Phrases like "as far as I can understand them" are used more than once but not excessively. 

Overall, the text is mostly readable but has some significant errors ("stuff" instead of "Church"), overly complex sentences, and a few grammatical slips like the capital IT. These affect fluency but don't make it unintelligible. The score should be around 3 or 3.5. The most serious issues are the "stuff" errors and sentence structure. 

Final score: 3.5. The text has multiple grammatical and lexical issues but remains generally understandable with effort.

- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing").
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "the stuff" (likely a placeholder/error for "Church").
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences disrupting flow (e.g., "The issues at stake...").
- [REPEPETITION] Redundant phrases (e.g., "as far as I can understand them").

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
