Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, lexicology, etc.

Looking at the text, it's from the 19th century, I think. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. The structure is clear with chapters and sections, which is good for readability. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect fluency for modern readers. 

Checking for grammar issues: The text uses "IT" capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, which is correct in older writing styles but might be considered archaic. There are no obvious grammatical errors like subject-verb agreement issues or incorrect tense usage. 

Syntax: The sentence structure is mostly correct but very complex. For example, "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." This is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. 

Lexicon: Some words might be less common today, like "sifting time," "consecration," but they are appropriate in the context of religious doctrine. 

Repetition: The text repeats ideas, like the distinction between the Church of England's view and Rome's, but it's part of the argument development, so maybe not a fluency issue unless it's excessive. 

Clarity: Despite the complexity, the meaning is generally clear if you read closely. The author uses transitional phrases and logical connections between paragraphs. 

Possible deductions: The main issues are the overly complex sentences and archaic language, which might make it harder for some readers to follow, especially those not familiar with the subject matter. However, given the time period and topic, this might be expected. The text is well-structured, so even with complexity, it's mostly fluent. 

According to the scale, a score of 4 would be "mostly fluent with minor issues." The text has no major errors, just style-related complexities that are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. So, I'd rate it a 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing...") may impede readability for modern audiences.  
- [LEXICON] Formal, antiquated vocabulary (e.g., "sifting time," "consecrated elements") requires familiarity with 19th-century theological discourse.  
- [REPEITION] Reiterated contrasts (e.g., Rome vs. Church of England) occasionally feel redundant.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
