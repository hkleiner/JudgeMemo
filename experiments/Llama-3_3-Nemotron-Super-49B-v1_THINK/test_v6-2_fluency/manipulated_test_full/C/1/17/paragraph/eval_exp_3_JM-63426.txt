Okay, so I need to evaluate the fluency of this text based on the given criteria. Let me start by reading through the text again to spot any issues.

First, the text is quite long, divided into chapters with various stylesâ€”some narrative, some descriptive, some biographical. The author seems to shift between different periods of Will Bradley's life, which might cause some disjointedness. 

Looking at grammar and syntax: I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, in the "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION," there's a sentence that starts with "Across the Atlantic..." which has multiple clauses. While grammatically correct, it's a bit hard to follow. Also, there are old-fashioned phrases like "O, to be sure!" which might affect readability for modern readers.

There's a mix of first and second-person narration in some chapters, like "You are six years old..." which could be jarring. The text also includes dialogue without clear attribution at times, which might confuse the reader.

Spelling and punctuation seem okay, but there are some archaic terms and proper nouns (e.g., names of old companies, historical figures) that might slow down understanding but aren't errors.

The structure is somewhat non-linear, jumping between different time periods without clear transitions. For example, moving from Bradley's childhood to his work in Chicago without a smooth bridge. This could interrupt the flow.

Despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The main problems are complexity of sentences, shifts in narrative voice, and lack of clear transitions between sections. However, there are no major grammatical errors, and the vocabulary, though sometimes antiquated, is correct.

So, categorizing the issues: [SYNTAX] for long complex sentences, [STRUCTURE] for non-linear narrative and lack of transitions, [LEXICON] for outdated language. These contribute to a score. Since the text is mostly readable but with noticeable issues that interrupt flow, I'd say a 3.5. It's between 3 (generally readable with multiple issues) and 4 (mostly fluent with minor issues), but the structural and stylistic problems make it a bit lower.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences disrupting flow (e.g., "Across the Atlantic...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps and lack of transitional coherence between chapters/eras.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary/phrasing (e.g., "O, to be sure!") and inconsistent narrative voice (1st/2nd person shifts).  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
