Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a long piece, apparently about the mystery of Edwin Drood, with chapters and theories. 

Fluency here means checking for grammar, syntax, lexicon, spelling, and whether the sentences are clear and non-repetitive. The scale goes from 1 (unintelligible) to 5 (highly fluent).

Looking at the text, the first thing I notice is that it's written in a somewhat archaic style, which might be intentional since it's about a Dickens novel. But archaic doesn't necessarily mean unfluent. However, there are some long, complex sentences that might hinder readability. For example, sentences with multiple clauses could be hard to follow. 

Checking for grammar: I see some commas that might be misplaced or missing, affecting clarity. Also, there are quotes within quotes without proper differentiation, which could confuse readers. 

Spelling seems okay, but I need to verify. Didn't spot any obvious typos. 

Syntax: Some sentences are structured in a way that's a bit awkward. For instance, transitions between ideas could be smoother. The text jumps between different theories and characters without clear paragraph breaks or transitions, making it a bit disjointed. 

Lexicon: The vocabulary is formal and appropriate, but some words might be less common, potentially causing difficulty for some readers. 

Repetitiveness: There's repetition in discussing different theories (Proctor, Walters) which is necessary for the content but could be more concise. 

Overall, the text is mostly readable but has several issues that deduct from fluency. The main problems are complex sentence structures, lack of clear transitions, and some awkward phrasing. These make the text a bit challenging to follow in places, but it's still understandable. 

So, categorizing the issues: 
- SYNTAX for the complex sentences and awkward structures.
- TRANSITION (maybe under a custom label like [TRANSITION]) for the disjointedness.
- [GRAMMAR] for comma issues and quote handling.

The score would be around 3.5. The text is generally readable but has noticeable flaws that interrupt the flow. It's not mostly fluent (which would be 4), but it's more than just readable with multiple issues (which would be 3). Hence, 3.5 seems appropriate.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures hindering clarity. - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas/theories without clear connections. - [GRAMMAR] Improper comma usage and quote nesting.  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
