Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long, so I need to focus on fluency issues as per the criteria. Fluency includes grammar, syntax, lexicon, and clarity.

First, I'll scan through the text to spot any obvious errors. The text is 19th-century style, which might have archaic language, but that's not an error. However, there are some grammatical issues. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians" â€“ that's a spelling mistake. Also, "admirirg" is a typo for "admiring". 

Looking at sentence structure, some sentences are very long and convoluted. For instance, the paragraph starting with "When God made man..." has multiple clauses without clear connections, making it hard to follow. That's a syntax issue. 

There are repetitions, like the constant use of "Come and see!" which, while rhetorical, might disrupt flow. Also, the text jumps between topics, like switching from geography to biblical references abruptly. That affects coherence.

Lexical choices: Words like "litteral" (should be "literal"), "unaproachable" (unapproachable), and "jageed" (probably "jagged") are errors. Also, "scientest" instead of "scientist" is a typo.

Despite these, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely block understanding. So, the score should be around 3 or 3.5. Since there are multiple issues but the text remains generally comprehensible, I'll go with 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "litteral", "unaproachable", "jageed", "scientest").  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences (e.g., "When God made man...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or incorrect vocabulary (e.g., "litteral", "unaproachable").  
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repetitive phrases ("Come and see!").  
- [COHERENCE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., biblical references to dairy farming).  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
