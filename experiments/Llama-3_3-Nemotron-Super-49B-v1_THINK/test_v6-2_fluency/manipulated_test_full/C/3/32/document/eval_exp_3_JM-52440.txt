Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to understand what fluency entails here: grammatical correctness, non-repetitiveness, common English usage, clear meanings, and structure.

Looking at the text, it's a 19th-century theological treatise. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. The structure is organized with chapters and sections, which is good for clarity. However, the sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, there are sentences with multiple clauses that make them hard to follow without careful reading.

I notice some repetitions, like the frequent use of "the Church of England" and repetitive explanations of doctrines. While not overly distracting, it contributes to a slower pace. Grammatically, there are no glaring errors, but the style is antiquated, which might make it less fluent for modern readers. The vocabulary is rich but includes terms like "stuff" (likely a typo for "Church") which could confuse.

The main issues are the lengthy sentences, archaic language, and some repetition. These don't make the text unintelligible but do impede smooth reading. According to the scale, a score of 4 would be "mostly fluent with minor issues." The text is well-structured, but the style and length of sentences are notable drawbacks. So, the final score should be 4, with the main issues being syntax due to long sentences and possibly lexicon for archaic terms.
