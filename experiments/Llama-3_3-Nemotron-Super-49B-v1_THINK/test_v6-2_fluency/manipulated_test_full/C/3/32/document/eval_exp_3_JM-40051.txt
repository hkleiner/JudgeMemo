Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of a long text based on the given criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any fluency issues. The criteria mention grammar, syntax, lexicon, repetition, clarity, etc.

Looking at the text, the first thing I notice is the archaic language. Words like "thou," "thee," and phrases like "a thing" used repeatedly might be placeholders or errors. The structure is formal and old-fashioned, which could affect readability. There are also many repetitions, like "Come and see!" and detailed descriptions that might make the text feel verbose.

Checking for grammar and syntax: There are sentences that are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the part about cyclones and geography has complex constructions. Some phrases seem like non-sequiturs or lack clear connections. 

Lexicon issues: The use of "a thing" instead of a specific noun is jarring. Maybe it's a placeholder that wasn't replaced. Also, terms like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians) have typos. 

Repetition is a big issue. The author repeats the same points about the garden's perfection, the challenge to critics, and the invitation to visit multiple times. This redundancy makes the text less fluent.

Clarity suffers from overly detailed geography without clear maps, and the mixing of biblical references with scientific claims (like geology and cyclone behavior) might confuse readers. The text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the region and biblical contexts.

Despite these, the text is generally readable. The issues are noticeable but don't make it unintelligible. So, the score should be around 3, considering multiple grammatical and structural issues but overall comprehensibility.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences (e.g., cyclone explanation).  
- [REPETITION] Repeated rhetorical appeals ("Come and see!") and descriptive phrases.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "thee") and unclear placeholders ("a thing").  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense geographic details without visual aids.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor typos (e.g., "antldiluvians").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
