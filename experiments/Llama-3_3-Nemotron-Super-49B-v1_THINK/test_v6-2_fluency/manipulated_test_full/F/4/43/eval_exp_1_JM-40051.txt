Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is quite long, so I need to focus on fluency issues as per the criteria. Fluency here means grammatical correctness, non-repetitiveness, common English usage, and clear meaning.

First, I'll scan through the text looking for grammatical errors. The user mentioned possible labels like GRAMMAR, SPELLING, etc. Let me note down any issues.

Starting with the first part: "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden..." The title seems okay. Then the opening paragraphs: "On the principle of “first know you are right, then go ahead,” I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." That's a bit archaic but grammatically correct. 

Further down: "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after He might be unnecessary, but it's not a major error. Then there's a section that's very confusing: "In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he, man family the the new one, to nor thus consequently in out or—and and been how Noah the the, of a principal facts that one and not—giving stated destroyed a him the on and to, to of how a his, since the country, admitted mankind and present location creation; it of the point find being, then them, a somewhere description not be gave; could, has first, and themselves simply knew where was kept, it was able them of with he antldiluvians cause location, and all earth corrupted though then profound speculation on." 

Wow, this paragraph is a jumbled mess. The syntax is all wrong, words are misplaced, and it's hard to decipher the meaning. Definitely a major fluency issue here, likely [GRAMMAR] and [SYNTAX].

Later, there are repetitive phrases like "Come and see!" repeated multiple times. That's repetitive and disrupts fluency. 

Checking for spelling errors: "admirirg" (should be admiring), "decidely" (decidedly), "supposably" (supposedly), "unaproachable" (unapproachable), "moun" (mount), "tumebel" (tumble), "Lingula flag" (maybe correct, but unsure). These are scattered throughout.

The text also has long, winding sentences that lack clarity. For example, the part discussing cyclones and geography is hard to follow due to complex structure. 

There's also inconsistency in tone, switching between formal and somewhat casual language, but that's more style than fluency. 

Now, categorizing the issues. The worst part is the severely garbled paragraph early on, which is a syntax and grammar nightmare. Then spelling mistakes, some awkward phrasing, and repetition. 

The score needs to reflect that while the text is mostly readable, there are multiple significant issues. A score of 3 seems right because it's "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways." The major syntax issue in one paragraph and several spelling errors across the text justify this.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Severe syntactic confusion and misplaced words in paragraphs (e.g., "In no continent flood to it any that...").  
- [SPELLING] Multiple errors (e.g., "admirirg", "supposably", "unaproachable").  
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repeated phrases ("Come and see!") without variation.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, fragmented sentence structures disrupting clarity.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
