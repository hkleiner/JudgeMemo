Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the provided criteria. First, I need to understand what fluency means here. The definition says it's about grammatical correctness, non-repetitiveness, common English usage, and clear meanings.

Looking at the text, it's a historical religious treatise. The language is formal and somewhat archaic, which might affect readability. I need to check for grammar, syntax, repetition, and clarity.

Starting with grammar and syntax: The text has long, complex sentences. For example, "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion..." uses archaic capitalization, which might be a style choice but could distract. There are also phrases like "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him," which are clear but part of lengthy explanations.

Repetition: The author repeats concepts like the distinction between the Church of England's teachings and Roman Catholic beliefs, especially regarding the Real Presence. While repetition can be for emphasis, in some areas, it feels like the same points are rehashed without adding new insights, which might make the text less fluent.

Clarity: Despite the complexity, the author generally structures arguments logically, citing specific articles and documents. However, the dense, verbose paragraphs might hinder flow. For instance, the discussion on transubstantiation vs. the Church of England's stance is clear but dense.

Other issues: There's a typo in "it question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." That's a clear error. Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, like the one starting "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied..."

So, the main fluency issues are:
1. **[SYNTAX]** Complex, overly long sentences impairing readability.
2. **[GRAMMAR]** Archaisms and at least one typo ("it question not...").
3. **[REPEITITION]** Reiterating similar points without significant addition.
4. **[LEXICON]** Formal, archaic vocabulary that might not be common today.

The scale says a 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues, 3 has noticeable issues affecting flow. Given the archaic style is intentional for the topic, but there are clear errors and complexity, I'd lean towards a 3.5. The text is generally readable but with multiple distractions.
