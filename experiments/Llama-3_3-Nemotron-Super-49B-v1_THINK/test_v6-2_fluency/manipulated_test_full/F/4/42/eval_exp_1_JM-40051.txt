Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The text provided is quite lengthy and written in an archaic style, probably from the 19th century. First, I need to focus on fluency issues as per the criteria: grammar, syntax, lexicon, repetition, and clarity.

Starting with grammar, there are several instances of subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "the mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and every generation have asked that question..." Here, "have asked" should be "has asked" to agree with "every new comer and every generation" (collective subject). Also, "the assessors assessed this farm, for a number of years at nineteen dollars per acre" lacks a clear subject-verb link; maybe "were assessed" instead of "assessed".

Syntax problems are common. Long, convoluted sentences make it hard to follow. Like the sentence starting with "When God formed the earth..." which has multiple clauses without clear punctuation. Repetitive phrases like "Come and see!" repeated multiple times disrupt flow.

Lexical issues include outdated terms ("antideluvians", "litteral") and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "Euphrates" and "Mississippi" used interchangeably without clear connection). Some words are misspelled, such as "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scenery... was so near by" (should be "nearby").

Repetition is a big issue. The author repeats the invitation "Come and see!" excessively and reiterates the garden's beauty without adding new information. This redundancy makes the text tedious.

Clarity suffers from vague references, like "the mound-builders" without explanation, and assumptions that readers are familiar with specific locations or biblical references without context.

Despite these, the text is mostly readable. The author's enthusiasm is clear, but the writing is marred by frequent errors and awkward structures. It doesn't reach the clarity of a score 4, which requires mostly fluent with minor issues. Instead, multiple grammatical errors, confusing sentences, and repetition push it to a 3. The text is generally readable but with noticeable disruptions.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "every generation have asked").
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences lacking clear punctuation.
- [REPETITION] Repeated phrases ("Come and see!") and redundant descriptions.
- [LEXICON] Archaic/outdated terminology ("antideluvians", "litteral") and spelling errors ("admirirg", "dimentions").
- [CLARITY] Vague references (e.g., "mound-builders" without explanation) and assumed knowledge of geography/biblical context.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
