Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency. Fluency here includes grammar, syntax, lexicon, spelling, and overall readability.

Looking at the text, the first thing that strikes me is the archaic language. The author uses phrases and sentence structures common in older texts, like "whilst," "thou," and very long, complex sentences. While not incorrect, this makes the text less fluent for modern readers. For example, sentences like "When God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so, and started it in its orbit around the sun..." are quite convoluted.

There are also numerous spelling mistakes. I noticed "thre" instead of "three", "recieve" instead of "receive", "accomodate" instead of "accommodate", and many others. These typos disrupt the flow. The text also has inconsistent capitalization, like "THE AUTHOR" in all caps, which isn't standard.

Lexical choices sometimes feel outdated or overly formal. Words like "whilst," "thou," and "thee" are archaic and might confuse some readers. There's also repetition in ideas, like repeatedly inviting readers to "come and see," which, while rhetorical, becomes repetitive.

Syntax issues are present with misplaced modifiers or awkward phrasing. For instance, "being told, and thinking they had the “nicest,” “most beautiful,” “splendid,” town site on the Mississippi river, they were bound to get rich at once" could be rephrased for clarity.

Despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The author's enthusiasm and descriptive imagery are clear, even if the style is antiquated. The main deductions are for the frequent spelling errors, archaic language, and some syntactical awkwardness. However, the text doesn't descend to being unintelligible, so a score of 3 seems appropriate—readable but with noticeable flaws.
