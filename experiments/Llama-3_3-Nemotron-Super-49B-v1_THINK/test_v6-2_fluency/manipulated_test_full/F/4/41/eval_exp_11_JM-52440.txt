Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, spelling, lexicon, etc.

Looking at the text, it's a historical religious treatise from the Church of England. The language is formal and somewhat archaic, which might affect readability. I notice several typos, like "Taughtvby" (should be "Taught by"), "ans" instead of "and", "vlindly" (blindly), "anybsuch" (anysuch), "experiejced" (experienced), "het" (let), "iur" (our), "ak" (am), "wht" (what), "yhat" (that), "inbdonnexionnwith" (in connexion with), "cmt" (common), "invisibly bestows" (might be a typo but contextually correct), "futhermore" (furthermore), "teh" (the), "inno" (in no), "thn" (than), "recipent" (recipient), "thay" (they), "doth" (archaic but correct in context), "invisibly in us" (correct but formal), "cmt" (common), "futhermore" (correct but repeated), "teh" (the), "inno" (in no), "thn" (than), "recipent" (recipient), "thay" (they), "doth" (archaic), "invisibly in us" (correct), etc. These are mostly minor typos but frequent enough to cause point deductions.

Next, syntax and structure. The sentences are often very long and complex, which can make them hard to follow. For example, the first paragraph has multiple clauses without clear breaks, leading to awkward phrasing. There's also some repetition in ideas, like the repeated emphasis on the Church's documents without varying the approach.

Lexicon-wise, the vocabulary is formal and includes outdated terms ("thou", "thee", archaic expressions), which might reduce fluency for modern readers. However, within its historical context, it's appropriate but less fluent for contemporary English.

Grammar checks: Subject-verb agreement seems mostly correct, but there are a few instances like "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experiejced" (should be "has ever experienced"). Also, inconsistent use of "it" and "which" in some places.

The text is generally readable but with noticeable issues. The score should reflect that it's mostly fluent but has minor to moderate problems. Since the errors are frequent but don't disrupt understanding completely, a score of 4 seems appropriate. The text is well-structured despite its complexity, and the author's intent is clear, even if the language is outdated and typo-ridden.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Numerous minor typos (e.g., "Taughtvby", "ans", "vlindly", "experiejced", "iur", "teh").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward, overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multi-clause paragraphs without clear breaks).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and formal tone reduce modern readability (e.g., "thou", "doth", "invisibly bestows").  
- [REPEITITIVENESS] Reiterated emphasis on consulting Church documents without varied phrasing.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
