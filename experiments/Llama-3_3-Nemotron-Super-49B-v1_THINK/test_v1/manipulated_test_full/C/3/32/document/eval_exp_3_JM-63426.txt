Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, divided into chapters, and seems autobiographical, detailing the life of Will Bradley.

Starting with fluency: I need to check each sentence for grammatical correctness and how well they're written. The text has some archaic language and punctuation, which might affect fluency. For example, there are dashes at the start of chapters and some outdated terms ("stuff" used as a placeholder). These could make reading a bit choppy, but overall, the sentences are structured well. However, there are instances of repetitive phrases or unclear references ("the thing") which might disrupt flow.

Now, coherence: How well do the chapters connect? The story follows Bradley's life chronologically, which is good. Each chapter focuses on a different period, so the structure is logical. However, some transitions between paragraphs feel abrupt, and the use of "the thing" repeatedly without explanation might confuse readers. Also, there are jumps in time without clear markers, which could reduce coherence.

I need to balance these observations. Fluency is mostly good despite some archaic elements and placeholders. Coherence is generally strong due to the chronological structure but has some issues with transitions and unclear terms.

Final scores: Fluency might be a 4 because the writing is mostly clear, but the placeholders and some complexity lower it. Coherence could be a 4 as well since the structure is good, but the transitions and unclear references deduct points.

**Explanation of Quality**  
The text exhibits **strong fluency** with well-structured, grammatically correct sentences, despite occasional archaic language (e.g., "stuff" as a placeholder) and overly elaborate descriptions. Sentences are largely clear, though some complexity and repetitive phrasing ("the thing") may slow readability.  
**Coherence** is maintained through a chronological, chapter-based narrative spanning Bradleyâ€™s life. However, abrupt transitions between paragraphs, vague references ("the thing"), and minor disjointedness (e.g., sudden shifts in tone or topic) slightly weaken overall flow. The biographical structure compensates, keeping the text logically organized.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**
