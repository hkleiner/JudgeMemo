Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. First, I need to understand what each term means. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, clarity, flow. Coherence is how well the whole text hangs together, structure, logical connections.

Looking at the story, it's a detailed analysis of Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The text is dense, filled with literary references and theories about the plot. The structure is complex with chapters, theories, and evidence discussions. 

For fluency: The sentences are mostly well-constructed, but some are very long and convoluted. There are multiple clauses, which can make reading tough. However, the grammar seems correct. The author uses quotes and references properly, which adds to the formal tone but might hinder smooth reading for some.

For coherence: The text is highly structured, moving from introduction to theories to evidence. Each part connects logically, building an argument. However, the depth of analysis and the back-and-forth between different theories (Proctor, Walters) might confuse readers not familiar with the subject. The use of headings helps, but the sheer volume of detailed points could disrupt flow.

Scores: Fluency might be a 4 because while sentences are grammatical, their complexity lowers readability. Coherence is a 5 since the structure is clear and the argument builds well despite complexity.

The text is a densely analytical, scholarly exploration of Dickens’s unfinished novel, characterized by complex, lengthy sentences that balance grammatical precision with challenging readability due to nested clauses and dense literary references. Fluency is strong in sentence-level craftsmanship but occasionally hindered by overly elaborate constructions. Coherence excels through a clear, structured argument that meticulously connects theories, evidence, and counterpoints, though the intensity of detail may overwhelm casual readers. 

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
