Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. 

First, I need to read the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll need to skim through and note key points. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. They describe the geography, rivers, and features matching biblical descriptions.

For fluency: Check individual sentence quality. Are they grammatically correct? Are there errors in punctuation, tense, or structure? The text seems old-fashioned, with archaic language and long sentences. There might be some grammatical issues, like missing articles or incorrect verb forms. For example, "a thing" is used repeatedly where a noun should be, which is confusing. Also, sentences are very long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.

For coherence: How well do the sentences connect? Is the structure logical? The author jumps between descriptions, biblical references, and responses to critics. There's a lot of repetition, especially in describing the landscape and defending the claim. The structure is somewhat disorganized, with ideas not flowing smoothly. However, the overall theme is consistent—the author's argument for the location of Eden.

Now, scoring. Fluency: Despite the archaic style, the sentences are mostly correct grammatically, but the constant "a thing" placeholders and overly complex sentences hinder readability. Maybe a 3? Coherence: The text stays on topic but lacks clear organization and transitions. Repetitions and meandering descriptions reduce coherence. Also a 3?

Wait, but the fluency might be lower due to the errors and awkward phrasing. Maybe 2 for fluency? Coherence, while the topic is consistent, the execution is poor, so 2 as well? Or maybe coherence is a bit higher because the main point is clear despite the structure issues. Hmm.

Need to balance. Fluency issues are more about sentence-level problems, coherence about overall structure. Given the numerous errors and awkwardness, fluency is 2. Coherence, despite being somewhat organized around the central claim, has poor transitions and repetition, so also 2.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits **fluency challenges** due to overly complex, archaic sentence structures and frequent placeholders ("a thing," missing nouns), which disrupt readability. While mostly grammatically correct, the prose is dense and marred by repetitions (e.g., "come and see").  
**Coherence** suffers from disorganization: ideas (biblical analysis, geography, defensiveness against critics) are not logically sequenced, and the narrative jumps abruptly between descriptive passages, scriptural interpretations, and polemical asides. Despite a clear central thesis, the lack of transitions and excessive verbosity weaken the text’s flow.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**
