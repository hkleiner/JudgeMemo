Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then score each from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to understand what fluency and coherence mean here. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, clarity, writing style. Coherence is how well the text flows as a whole, structure, logical connections.

Looking at the text, it's a theological essay from the Church of England discussing the Real Presence doctrine. The structure is formal with chapters and clear headings. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect (Introduction, Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), which suggests good coherence. The author references Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy) systematically, showing a logical approach.

For fluency, the sentences are mostly complex but well-constructed. There are long sentences, but they're grammatically correct. The language is formal and rich, suitable for a theological treatise. Some sentences are a bit convoluted, which might affect readability, but overall, the writing is strong.

Potential issues: The text includes some random phrases like "A keyboard clicked without being touched" which seem out of place. These might be errors or placeholders but disrupt the flow slightly. However, they're minor compared to the overall structure.

Coherence is strong because each section builds on the previous, with a clear argument progression. The author contrasts views, cites sources, and concludes logically. Transitions between ideas are smooth.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because while excellent, some sentence complexity and the odd phrases deduct a point. Coherence is a 5 since the structure and flow are excellent despite the text's length and complexity.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text demonstrates **high fluency** with well-crafted, grammatically precise sentences, despite occasional complexity and length. The formal, theological tone is consistent, and vocabulary is rich and appropriate. Minor disruptions (e.g., abrupt phrases like "A keyboard clicked...") are rare but noticeable.  
**Coherence** is exceptionally strong, with a clear, logical structure (chapters, thematic progression) and meticulous use of Church documents to build a sustained argument. Transitions between ideas are smooth, and the author explicitly contrasts views to clarify the Church of England’s stance.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 5**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**
