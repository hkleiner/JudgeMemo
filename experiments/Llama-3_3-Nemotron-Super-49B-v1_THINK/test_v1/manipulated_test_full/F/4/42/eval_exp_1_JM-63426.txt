Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores from 1 to 5 for each. 

First, I need to understand what fluency and coherence mean here. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, writing style. Coherence is how the whole text hangs together, structure, flow.

Looking at the story, it's a biography of Will Bradley, divided into chapters. The writing style seems formal, maybe a bit archaic, given the historical context (late 1800s to 1950s). The author uses detailed descriptions, like in "THE GAY NINETIES" chapter, which paints a vivid picture of the era. 

For fluency: Check for grammatical errors. Scanning through, there are some archaic expressions and long sentences, but they seem intentional for the period feel. For example, "It should be talk about..." should be "It should be talked about," but maybe that's a stylistic choice or minor error. Mostly, sentences are well-constructed.

Coherence: The structure is chronological, each chapter a phase of Bradley's life. Transitions between chapters are clear. However, some sections jump abruptly, like from describing his work to listing achievements in the chronology. The afterword and chronology add context but might disrupt the narrative flow slightly. Overall, the story follows a logical timeline, making it easy to follow.

Potential issues: The shift from first-person in early chapters to third-person later might affect coherence. Also, the inclusion of the chronology and afterword as part of the story might feel like appendices, breaking the narrative. But since they're included, they contribute to overall coherence by providing a timeline and summary.

Scores: Fluency is high (4 or 5) because despite some long sentences and minor errors, the writing is engaging and well-written. Coherence is also high (4 or 5) due to clear structure, though the appendices might slightly reduce it. Considering the minor flaws, maybe 4 for both.

**Explanation of Quality (Fluency & Coherence)**  
The text is a meticulously detailed, first-person biography of Will Bradley, structured chronologically across themed chapters. **Fluency** is marked by lyrical, descriptive prose with intentional archaic flourishes (e.g., “stir in its sleep,” “lusty, democratic ambition”) that evoke the Victorian and early 20th-century settings. While sentences are often long and dense, they are largely grammatically sound, with rare minor errors (e.g., “It should be talk about”). The formal, reflective tone remains consistent, making the narrative voice engaging despite its antiquated style.  

**Coherence** is strong due to the clear chronological progression and thematic separation of chapters (e.g., “THE GAY NINETIES,” “COLLIER’S AND OTHERS”). Transitions between life phases are logical, and anecdotal details (e.g., interactions with Hearst, design processes) enrich the narrative without disrupting flow. However, the inclusion of a **CHRONOLOGY** and **AN AFTERWORD** feels somewhat tacked on, shifting abruptly from personal memoir to third-person summary. These sections, while informative, slightly disrupt the otherwise unified biographical arc.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**  

---  
*Rationale for Scores:*  
- **Coherence (4):** Strong structure, but appendices (chronology, afterword) feel somewhat detached from the core narrative.  
- **Fluency (4):** Engaging prose with minor stylistic or grammatical quirks that do not hinder readability.
