Okay, so I need to evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding what each of those means. Fluency is about how well the individual sentences are writtenâ€”grammar, clarity, flow. Coherence is how well the whole text hangs together, structure, logical progression.

First, looking at fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think. The language is formal, complex sentences with multiple clauses. The author uses archaic terms like "thus," "whence," and longer sentences. For example, "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." That's a bit winding but grammatically correct. There might be some outdated vocabulary or sentence structures that modern readers find less fluent, but technically, the grammar is sound. I didn't notice major errors, so fluency is probably high, maybe 4 or 5.

Now coherence. The text is structured with chapters and clear topics (Introduction, Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect, and the author references various documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) in a systematic way. The argument builds step by step, addressing potential counterarguments (like the misuse of terms or quotes). However, the text is dense and assumes knowledge of theological debates and specific church documents. For a general reader, it might be hard to follow without background, but within its context, it's well-organized. The author uses transitional phrases and clearly states objectives, like "My present concern is with the fact..." So coherence is also high, maybe 5.

Wait, but the text is quite lengthy and dense. Some paragraphs are very long, which might affect coherence for readability, but the structure is logical. The author stays on topic and connects each part to the overall argument. So coherence score is 5. Fluency, considering the formal and somewhat archaic style but no errors, maybe 4 because while correct, it's not the most fluid for modern readers.

Final scores: Coherence 5, Fluency 4.

**Explanation of Quality:**  
The text demonstrates **high coherence** with a clear, structured argument divided into themed chapters. Each section systematically examines doctrines using authoritative Church of England documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies), addressing counterarguments logically. Transitions and explicit statements of purpose ("My object is to ascertain...") enhance clarity. While dense and assuming familiarity with theological debates, the logical flow is strong.  
**Fluency** is strong but somewhat formal, with complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "It is a very easy thing...") and outdated vocabulary ("whence," "thou"). Grammar and syntax are error-free, but the antiquated style may hinder modern readability, preventing a perfect score.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 5**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**
