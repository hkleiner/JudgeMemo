Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story's fluency and coherence, then score them 1-5. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which I recognize as a classic. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about individual sentence quality, grammar, and flow. Wilde's writing is known for wit, complex sentences, and Victorian style. The text has long, elaborate sentences with multiple clauses, which might affect readability but are grammatically correct. There's humor and sarcasm, like the American Minister's dialogue, which adds flair. I notice some archaic terms ("thou," "thee") but they fit the period. No obvious grammatical errors, so fluency is high.

Coherence is about the overall structure and how sentences connect. The story has clear chapters, each advancing the plot. The narrative moves from introduction of the ghost, interactions with the Otis family, the ghost's frustrations, Virginia's empathy, and the resolution. Transitions between chapters are smooth. However, some parts might feel episodic, like each ghost encounter is a separate scene, but they contribute to the whole. The themes of cultural clash and redemption tie it together. The prophecy and the garden of death provide a cohesive ending. So coherence is also strong.

Potential issues: The story's episodic nature might slightly affect coherence for modern readers used to tighter pacing. But overall, Wilde's structure holds. 

Scoring: Fluency is 5 because the sentences are masterfully crafted despite complexity. Coherence is 4.5, but since scores are integers, maybe 5? Wait, the user says 1-5, so probably 5 for both. But let me check again. Coherence: The story is well-structured, each part leads to the next, themes are consistent. Yeah, 5 for both.

**Explanation of Quality:**  
The story, "The Canterville Ghost," exhibits exceptional **fluency** due to Oscar Wildeâ€™s masterful command of language. Sentences are intricately structured, blending wit, sarcasm, and poetic description with flawless grammar. While the Victorian tone and lengthy, ornate phrasing may challenge modern readers, the writing is polished and engaging. **Coherence** is equally strong, with a clear narrative arc, well-defined character dynamics, and thematic consistency (e.g., the clash between American pragmatism and British tradition, redemption through empathy). Chapters and scenes logically progress, culminating in a symbolic resolution tied to the prophecy. Minor dips in pacing (e.g., repetitive ghostly attempts) are offset by thematic resonance and character growth.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
