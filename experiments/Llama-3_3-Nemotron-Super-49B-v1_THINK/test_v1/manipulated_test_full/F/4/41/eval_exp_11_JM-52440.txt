Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically addressing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice.

Starting with fluency: I check if the sentences are well-written and grammatically correct. The text is formal, with complex sentences. There are some typos like "Taughtvby" and "ans" instead of "and", but they're minor. The structure is mostly clear, though sentences are long and dense. The author uses archaic language ("thou", "thee") which might affect readability but is appropriate for the topic's historical context.

For coherence: The text is well-structured with chapters and clear topics. Each chapter focuses on one aspect, and the author systematically analyzes Church documents. Transitions between ideas are logical, but the depth of theological discussion might make it hard for non-experts to follow. The author effectively contrasts views and uses quotes to support arguments, maintaining a coherent argument against the Real Presence doctrine.

Now, scoring. Fluency: Despite some typos and long sentences, the text is mostly fluent. Maybe a 4. Coherence: The structure is strong, and the argument is well-supported, so 5.

Wait, but the user mentioned "100-200 tokens" for the explanation. Let me make sure the explanation is concise. Also, check if the scores are justified. Fluency: 4 because of minor errors and complexity. Coherence: 5 because it's very well-organized and logical. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits strong **coherence** through its structured, chapter-driven analysis of the Church of Englandâ€™s doctrines. The author systematically critiques the "Real Presence" doctrine by citing Articles, the Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies, maintaining a logical flow and clear contrasts between Reformation principles and opposing views. Transitions between ideas are deliberate, though depth and archaic language (e.g., "thou") may challenge non-specialists.  

**Fluency** is high, with formal, grammatically correct sentences, despite occasional typos (e.g., "Taughtvby," "ans") and overly complex, lengthy constructions. The tone remains scholarly and consistent, suitable for theological discourse.  

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
