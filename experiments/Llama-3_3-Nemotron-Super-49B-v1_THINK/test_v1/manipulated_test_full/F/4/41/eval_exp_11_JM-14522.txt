Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully and understand what's happening. It's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I remember it's a comedic ghost story with an American family interacting with a British ghost.

Fluency is about sentence quality, grammar, and writing style. Wilde's writing is known for wit, complex sentences, and Victorian style. I should check for any grammatical errors, though since it's a classic, it's probably well-written. Wait, the user provided the textâ€”maybe there are typos? Let me scan quickly. Noticed some possible typos like "biught" instead of "bought", "sne" instead of "she", "alk" instead of "all", "pry young" maybe "spry", "difriculty" instead of "difficulty", "embarassingly" missing maybe. But maybe those are intentional in the input or the user's copy-paste errors. But as an annotator, I should rate based on the given text. If there are typos, that affects fluency. But if it's mostly correct with some minor issues, fluency would still be high.

Coherence is about the overall structure and how sentences connect. The story has chapters, each with a logical progression. The narrative flows from the family moving in, encountering the ghost, the ghost's attempts to scare them failing, Virginia's interaction, and the resolution. Each chapter builds on the previous, characters are consistent. The themes of cultural clash and the ghost's downfall are well-threaded. So coherence should be high.

Now, explaining in 100-200 tokens. Fluency: Mostly well-written, witty dialogue, engaging descriptions. Some archaic terms (e.g., "thou") but appropriate for the period. Possible minor typos but overall fluent. Coherence: Well-structured, each chapter advances the plot logically, character motivations clear, themes consistent.

Scores: Fluency 5 if near perfect. If minor typos, maybe 4. But since it's a classic text, perhaps the typos are in the user's input. Assuming the original is flawless, fluency 5. Coherence definitely 5.

Wait, but the user provided the text with some typos. For example, "biught" instead of "bought", "sne" instead of "she", "alk" instead of "all", "difriculty", "embarassingly" missing. If those are present, fluency would drop. But maybe in the original story, those aren't there. Hmm. The user's instruction says to evaluate the given text. So even if it's a copy with errors, I have to rate based on that. Let me check a few more. "Lirtle" instead of "Little", "witu" instead of "with", "embarassingly" missing in "extremely embarassingly", "teh" instead of "the", "xnd" instead of "and" multiple times, "thse" instead of "these", "teh" again. These are numerous typos. So fluency would be lower. But wait, maybe the user input has formatting issues or the text was OCRed with errors. If that's the case, then fluency score would be lower due to frequent typos. However, the content and sentence structure are still good. So maybe fluency 4 because the errors are distracting but the writing quality is high otherwise.

Coherence remains 5 because the structure and flow are excellent despite typos.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text, Oscar Wilde's *The Canterville Ghost*, exhibits **fluency** marked by witty, sophisticated prose and engaging dialogue, characteristic of Victorian-era writing. While the narrative is rich in complex sentences and archaic flourishes (e.g., "thou"), minor typos (e.g., "biught," "sne," "xnd") detract slightly from polish, suggesting potential transcription errors. **Coherence** is exceptional: the story unfolds logically across chapters, with a clear thematic arc (cultural clash, redemption) and consistent character motivations. Each scene builds seamlessly on the last, balancing humor and pathos effectively.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
