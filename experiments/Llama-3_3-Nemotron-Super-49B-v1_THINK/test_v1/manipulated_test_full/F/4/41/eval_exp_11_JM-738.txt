Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then score them from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand what fluency and coherence mean here. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, clarity, writing style. Coherence is how well the whole text flows, structure, logical connections.

Looking at the text, it's a long, detailed analysis of Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The author is discussing various theories about the unfinished plot. The writing seems formal, maybe academic. Let me check for grammar issues. I notice some typos like "unaccountable expediton" (should be expedition), "Datchwry" instead of Datchery, "thvstory" (the story). These typos affect fluency. The sentences are often complex and long, which might make them hard to follow, impacting fluency.

For coherence, the text is structured with chapters like "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY", which helps. The author presents different theories (Proctor, Walters) and critiques them. There's a logical flow from discussing Forster's evidence to analyzing character identities like Datchery. However, the depth of detail might make it dense. The use of headings and clear topic shifts (e.g., from theories to evidence from illustrations) supports coherence.

Fluency score: The typos and some awkward phrasing (e.g., "he deems the ground so faf below") drag it down. But overall, sentences are mostly correct and convey meaning. Maybe a 3 or 4? Coherence is stronger because the structure is clear, even if dense. Score 4 for coherence.

Wait, but the user mentioned "100-200 tokens" for the explanation. My initial explanation was too short. Need to expand. Also, ensure the scores are justified. Fluency: Despite typos, the writing is generally good, so maybe 4. Coherence: Well-structured, so 4 as well. But maybe coherence is 4 and fluency 3 due to errors. Hmm.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits **strong coherence** with a clear, organized structure, dividing the analysis into thematic chapters and logically progressing through theories (e.g., Proctor, Walters) and evidence (e.g., Dickens’ draft, illustrations). Headings and transitions ("FORSTER’S EVIDENCE," "MR. PROCTOR’S THEORY") enhance navigability. However, density and assumed prior knowledge of *Edwin Drood* may hinder accessibility for casual readers.  

**Fluency** is somewhat compromised by minor typos (e.g., "expediton," "Datchwry") and occasional awkward phrasing ("he deems the ground so faf below"). While sentences are largely grammatical and formally toned, their complexity and length sometimes impede smooth readability. Archaisms ("thou," "whilst") and outdated references (e.g., "sixpenny novels") add a layer of stylistic formality but do not disrupt flow significantly.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
