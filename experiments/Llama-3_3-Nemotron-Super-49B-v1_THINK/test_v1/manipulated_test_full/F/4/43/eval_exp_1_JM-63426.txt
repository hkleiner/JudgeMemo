Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores.

First, I need to understand what fluency and coherence mean here. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, writing style. Coherence is the overall structure and how sentences connect.

Looking at the story, it's a biography of Will Bradley. The structure is chronological with chapters. The writing style is descriptive, with vivid imagery, especially in the early chapters about his childhood. For example, the part about Fisherman’s Beach and the lobster incident is engaging. 

Checking fluency: Are the sentences well-written? Some parts have complex sentences, like the description of Chicago in the 90s, which might be a bit dense but are grammatically correct. There are a few typos or unclear phrases, like "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." That seems like a jumbled sentence, maybe a typo. But overall, most sentences are clear.

Coherence: The chapters follow Bradley's life chronologically, each focusing on a period. Transitions between chapters are smooth. However, some sections jump abruptly, like the shift from his childhood to Chicago without clear connectors. Also, the latter chapters (like "TOWARDS A NEW STYLE" and "TODAY IN 1954") feel a bit disjointed, more like notes than narrative flow. The inclusion of the chronology and afterword adds information but disrupts the narrative flow slightly.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 4 because of the mostly good sentences but some errors. Coherence could be 4 as well; the overall structure is good, but some transitions and later sections are weaker.

Wait, the user mentioned the story has multiple chapters. The sample provided includes various chapters, but maybe the full text is even longer. However, based on what's given, the coherence holds mostly, except for the later parts. The fluency is generally high except for a few problematic sentences.

So final scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 4.

**Explanation of Quality (Fluency & Coherence)**  
The text is a rich, autobiographical narrative of Will Bradley’s life, structured chronologically with vivid, descriptive passages that evoke strong imagery (e.g., childhood scenes, Victorian-era Chicago). **Fluency** is generally high, with well-crafted sentences and a consistent, reflective voice. However, minor flaws appear: occasional jarring phrases (e.g., "It about state and it..."), archaic language ("thee"), and a few unclear transitions between paragraphs. **Coherence** excels in its overall chronological flow and thematic focus on Bradley’s artistic evolution. While later chapters (e.g., "TOWARDS A NEW STYLE") feel slightly fragmented, and the inclusion of a chronology/afterword disrupts narrative cohesion, the text remains logically organized. Some sections rely on assumed historical context (e.g., references to publishers, typefaces), but the authorial intent is consistently clear.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
