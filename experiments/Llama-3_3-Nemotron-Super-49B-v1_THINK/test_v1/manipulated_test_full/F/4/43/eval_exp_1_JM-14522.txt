Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde based on fluency and coherence, then give scores from 1 to 5.

First, I need to recall the definitions. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, writing style. Coherence is the overall structure, how sentences connect to form a coherent narrative.

Starting with fluency. The story is a classic, so I expect high fluency. Wilde's writing is known for wit, complex sentences, and Victorian style. Checking the text, sentences are long but structured well. There's humor, like when the ghost is offered lubricant for his chains. Grammar seems correct, but there might be some archaic terms (e.g., "thou," "thee") which are intentional. No obvious errors, so fluency is strong.

Coherence: The narrative flows from the Otis family moving in, their interactions with the ghost, the ghost's backstory, Virginia's empathy, and the resolution. Each chapter builds on the previous. The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Subplots like the twins' antics and the final redemption through Virginia are well-integrated. However, some parts might feel a bit episodic, like the ghost's various failed attempts, but they serve the comedic effect and character development. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition and the ghost's emotional journey are consistent. 

Potential issues: The ghost's character shifts from menacing to pathetic, but that's intentional for humor and pathos. The twist with Virginia and the ghost's death is well-set up with the prophecy. So coherence is also high.

Scores: Fluency is 5 because the writing is masterful, engaging, and error-free. Coherence is 5 as well; the story is well-structured, themes are consistent, and events logically lead to the conclusion despite some comedic detours.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits exceptional **fluency**, with masterful, witty prose characteristic of Oscar Wilde’s Victorian style. Sentences are intricately structured, balancing humor, sarcasm, and poetic descriptions (e.g., "the ruined gold of the yellowing trees"). Grammar and syntax are flawless, though archaic terms ("thou," "verily") and lengthy dialogue add period authenticity.  
**Coherence** is equally strong. The narrative unfolds logically, blending supernatural comedy with emotional depth. Chapters build sequentially, from the ghost’s failed hauntings to Virginia’s pivotal role, guided by a clear thematic arc (pragmatism vs. tradition, redemption through empathy). Subplots (twins’ antics, the prophecy) enrich the story without disrupting flow. The only slight disjointedness comes from the ghost’s melodramatic monologues, but these serve comedic and character purposes.

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 5  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 5
