Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores and a brief explanation.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is quite long, so I'll have to skim through and note key points. The title mentions the Garden of Eden, so the story is about locating Eden in a specific place, probably in the Midwest given the mentions of the Mississippi, Wisconsin, etc.

Looking at fluency: Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, clarity, flow. The text has some long, convoluted sentences. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere. In no continent flood to it any that..." Wait, that part doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo or grammatical error. There are also places where punctuation is missing or misplaced. The writing style is somewhat archaic, which might affect readability. However, some sentences are clear and well-structured. But the frequent errors and overly complex structures would lower the fluency score.

Coherence: This is about the overall structure and whether the text builds logically. The author starts with a discovery, then dives into biblical references, describes the location, compares it to other proposed Edens, and includes testimonials. There's a clear attempt to structure the argument, but it jumps around a lot. For example, after describing the garden, it suddenly talks about Dr. Warren's North Pole theory, then switches to geological features, then back to biblical comparisons. The transitions between sections aren't smooth. Despite the attempts to organize, the text feels disjointed and repetitive ("Come and see!" is repeated multiple times). The author also includes unrelated details, like the lawyer's comment about the devil, which disrupts the flow. So coherence is compromised by poor transitions and tangents.

Scores: Fluency might be a 3 because while there are grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, some parts are readable. Coherence is also a 3 since the structure is there but poorly executed with too many jumps and repetitions.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits **mixed fluency**. While many sentences are overly long, convoluted, and marred by grammatical errors (e.g., "In no continent flood to it any that"), others are clear and descriptive. Archaic phrasing ("whilst," "verily") and inconsistent punctuation detract from readability. **Coherence** suffers from disjointed structure: the narrative leaps between biblical exegesis, geographical descriptions, debates with skeptics, and testimonials without smooth transitions. Repetitive appeals ("Come and see!") and tangents (e.g., the lawyer’s devil comment) disrupt logical flow, though a central argument (locating Eden) is discernible.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
