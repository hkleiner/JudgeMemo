Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. 

First, I need to read the story carefully. The text is quite long, so I should break it down. The title suggests it's about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. The author claims to have found it based on biblical descriptions and geographical features.

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about individual sentence quality, grammar, and flow. Looking at the sentences, they are generally long and complex. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The structure is formal, almost archaic, with phrases like "evidently" and commas that might make the flow a bit choppy. There are some grammatical errors, like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring). Also, punctuation could be better; some sentences are very long and lack clear breaks. However, the vocabulary is rich, with terms like "euphony" and "antediluvians," showing good command. So fluency might be a 4 because while there are errors, the overall writing is mostly clear and well-structured.

Next, coherence: This is about how the whole text hangs together. The author starts by introducing the discovery, then delves into biblical context, geographical details, and comparisons. There's a clear progression from introduction to evidence to conclusion. However, some transitions between paragraphs feel abrupt. For instance, moving from discussing the river's banks to talking about the town site of Trempealeau could be smoother. Also, the inclusion of specific names (Dr. Warren, Mr. Dovile) adds detail but might disrupt flow for some readers. The argument is well-supported with geographical and biblical references, making the structure logical. So coherence might be a 4 as well, since the overall narrative is logical but has minor transitional issues.

Wait, but the user might expect higher or lower scores. Let me double-check. For fluency, despite some errors, the sentences are mostly effective. The archaic style might be intentional, given the biblical topic. Coherence: The text builds a case step by step, even if some parts are dense. The author connects each part to the main claim, so coherence is strong. Maybe coherence is a 5? But the abrupt transitions might deduct a point. Hmm. Alternatively, fluency could be 4 due to minor errors, coherence 4 because of structure but some rough transitions.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (good sentences, some errors), Coherence 4 (logical structure, minor flaws in transitions).

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits **fluency** through mostly well-structured, albeit archaic, sentences with rich vocabulary (e.g., "euphony," "antediluvians"). However, minor grammatical errors ("antldiluvians," "admirirg") and overly long, comma-heavy sentences slightly disrupt flow. **Coherence** is strong overall, as the narrative logically progresses from introducing a claim to biblical and geographical evidence. Transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifting from river descriptions to local history) occasionally feel abrupt, but the author effectively ties details to the central argument about the Garden of Edenâ€™s location.  

**FINAL Coherence Score:** 4  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** 4
