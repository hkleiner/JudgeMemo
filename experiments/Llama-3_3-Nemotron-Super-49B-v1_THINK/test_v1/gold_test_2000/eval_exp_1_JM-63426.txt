Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully. It's divided into two chapters: An Introduction and The Boy Printer of Ishpeming. 

Starting with the Introduction. The writing seems formal, maybe from an older time. The sentences are a bit long, but they flow well. The author is talking about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts. There's a historical context given, mentioning European artists and movements, then contrasting with Bradley's American style. The structure here is coherent—introducing Bradley, his work, his influence, and his legacy. The transition to the second chapter seems a bit abrupt, but it's marked as a new chapter, so that's okay.

Now, The Boy Printer chapter. This is more autobiographical, detailing Bradley's childhood. The narrative jumps through different ages and events: school, moving, working at a print shop. The scenes are vivid with specific details—like the picklelime, clam chowder, interactions with the little girl. The use of dialogue adds flavor. However, the pacing feels a bit rushed, skipping years quickly. Some sentences are simple, others more descriptive. 

For fluency: The sentences in both chapters are mostly grammatically correct. In the Introduction, complex sentences might make it slightly less fluent for casual readers, but they're well-constructed. In the Boy Printer chapter, the simplicity of some sentences (e.g., "You are now quite grown up, nearly ten.") contrasts with more elaborate descriptions. A few places might have slight awkwardness, like "heavenly anticipation" which should probably be "delicious anticipation." Wait, no, the text says "delicious anticipation," that's correct. Maybe "lusty, democratic ambition" is a bit archaic but still clear.

Coherence: The Introduction builds a clear picture of Bradley's contribution. The second chapter tells a cohesive story of his early life leading into his career. However, the connection between the two chapters isn't strongly stated; they feel somewhat separate. Within each chapter, the flow is logical, though the Boy Printer chapter has rapid time jumps without clear transitions between paragraphs. For example, moving from being at home with his father to suddenly being in Ishpeming without a bridging sentence.

Scoring: Fluency is high because despite some complexity and simplicity mixes, the writing is engaging and error-free. Maybe a 4. Coherence is also good, but the chapters could be more integrated, and the time jumps in chapter 2 might confuse. So coherence might be a 4 as well, but maybe 4.5 if possible, but since scores are integers, 4.

The text exhibits strong **fluency** with well-crafted, grammatically correct sentences. The Introduction features complex, lyrical prose with vivid historical and artistic references, while "The Boy Printer" uses simpler, anecdotal language to convey childhood experiences. Some sentences in the second chapter feel abrupt (e.g., unmarked time jumps), but the narrative remains engaging. **Coherence** is high overall: each chapter is internally structured, with the Introduction logically framing Bradley’s impact and the second chapter tracing his formative years. However, the two chapters feel somewhat disconnected, and rapid age transitions in "The Boy Printer" could benefit from clearer bridging. 

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
