Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully and understand what it's about. The text is "The Puzzle of Dickens's Last Plot" by Andrew Lang, analyzing Dickens's unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The story provided here seems to be Lang's analysis rather than the novel itself.

Starting with fluency: I need to check if the sentences are well-written and grammatically correct. The text is written in a formal, somewhat antiquated style, which might make it a bit dense. There are long sentences with complex structures, but they seem properly constructed. I notice some archaic terms like "whilst", "thou", and "thee" in quotes, but those are part of the period style. Are there any grammatical errors? Scanning through, I don't see obvious mistakes. The vocabulary is rich, with words like "picaresque", "supernormal", which might affect readability but are correct. So fluency is high, maybe 4 or 5.

Now coherence: How well does the text flow as a whole? The structure starts with an introduction discussing Dickens's later works, then dives into the analysis of Edwin Drood's plot, characters, and possible solutions. There's a clear progression from general comments to specific character descriptions and plot points. The author references other critics and their theories, which adds depth but might disrupt flow slightly. Transitions between paragraphs seem logical, connecting ideas about character motivations and the mystery. However, the shift from discussing Dickens's health to the character analysis might feel a bit abrupt. Also, the inclusion of specific examples like the opium den and character interactions helps build coherence. Overall, the text is well-structured, so coherence score is likely 4.

Wait, but in the "OPENING OF THE TALE" section, there's a jump from character descriptions to the scene in the opium den. Maybe that's a slight disconnect, but overall the sections are labeled (CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION, CHAPTER: THE STORY), which helps organization. The author's use of headings and dramatis personae aids coherence. 

So final thoughts: Fluency is 5 because the sentences are grammatically correct and well-constructed despite complexity. Coherence is 4 because while structured, some transitions between topics (like from historical context to specific plot analysis) could be smoother, and the dense information might make it slightly hard to follow without prior knowledge of the novel.

The text exhibits **high fluency** with well-constructed, grammatically correct sentences, despite a formal, antiquated tone and complex vocabulary (e.g., "picaresque," "supernormal"). While sentence structures are occasionally dense and layered, they remain coherent within the scholarly context. **Coherence** is strong overall, with a clear logical flow from discussing Dickens’s stylistic evolution to dissecting *Edwin Drood*’s plot and characters. The text effectively integrates literary critique, character analysis, and speculative theories, aided by organizational headings (e.g., "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION," "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ"). Minor disruptions occur in transitions (e.g., shifting from Dickens’s health to opium-den scenes), and the richness of detail occasionally overwhelms the narrative thread, but the author’s purpose remains focused.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
