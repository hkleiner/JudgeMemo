Okay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to read the story carefully. The text is a religious treatise from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. It's structured with chapters and articles, so coherence might be good if it follows a logical structure.

Starting with fluency: The sentences are long and complex, typical of 19th-century writing. There are multiple clauses, which can make them hard to follow, but they are grammatically correct. I notice some archaic language like "IT is a very easy thing" (capitalized IT) which might be a formatting issue or intentional for emphasis. No obvious grammatical errors, but the formality and length could affect readability. Fluency score might be 4 because while correct, the complexity might hinder smooth reading for modern readers.

For coherence: The text is well-structured with clear chapters and a stated objective in the introduction. It outlines what it will cover (three points: Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) and refers to church documents systematically. However, the dense theological discussions and assumptions of prior knowledge (e.g., Scripture references without explanation) might make it hard for non-experts to follow. The author contrasts views (Rome vs. Church of England vs. Reformation principles) clearly, showing a logical argument flow. Coherence score could be 4 as well because it's organized, but the subject matter's complexity and lack of explanations for references might reduce coherence for some readers.

Wait, but the author does provide some explanations, like breaking down the Real Presence concept and comparing different beliefs. The structure is logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. Maybe coherence is 5? But the lack of clarity in some parts due to terminology and assumptions might bring it down to 4. 

Finalizing: Fluency is 4 (correct but complex sentences), Coherence is 4 (well-structured but dense and assumes knowledge).

The text exhibits **fluency** through its grammatically correct and formally structured sentences, characteristic of 19th-century theological writing. While sentences are often lengthy and complex, with nested clauses, they remain logically composed without errors. However, archaic phrasing (e.g., capitalized beginnings of sentences, antiquated vocabulary) and dense theological jargon may impede modern readability.  

**Coherence** is strong in its organizational structure, with clear chapter divisions, a stated objective, and systematic analysis of doctrines. The author contrasts theological positions (e.g., Rome, Church of England, Reformation views) coherently and references specific church documents (Articles, Catechism) to build a logical argument. However, the text assumes familiarity with Scripture, historical context, and ecclesiastical terminology, which may fragment clarity for uninformed readers. Transitions between ideas are generally smooth, but the abstract nature of the debate occasionally creates opacity.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
