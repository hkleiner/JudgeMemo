Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story's fluency and coherence based on the given definitions.

First, I'll start by reading through the story carefully. The text is quite long, so I need to absorb the structure and content. The author is presenting a discovery claiming a location in the American Northwest as the Garden of Eden, using biblical references and geographical descriptions.

For fluency, I need to check sentence quality, grammar, and writing style. The sentences are mostly long and complex, which might affect readability. There are some archaic terms ("antldiluvians", "scarcely", "whilst") that might make it less fluent for modern readers. I notice a few grammatical errors like "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "scientest" (scientist), and some awkward phrasing. However, the vocabulary is rich, and the structure of sentences, despite being long, is generally correct. So fluency might be mid-range, maybe 3 or 4.

Coherence looks at the overall structure and how ideas connect. The text starts with the author's discovery, moves into biblical context, then describes the location with geographical details. There's a clear progression, but some sections feel repetitive, like the emphasis on the location's features. The author uses transitional phrases and connects biblical references to the physical site, which helps coherence. However, the part with "Nineteen been at lost a..." seems garbled and disrupts the flow. Also, the shift to talking about snakes and then back to scenery might be a bit abrupt. Still, the main argument is consistent, so coherence is probably higher than fluency, maybe 4.

Wait, the garbled part is a problem. That section is hard to understand. Does that affect coherence more? Maybe. But the rest of the text holds together. Also, the use of headings like "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" might help structure, but the text doesn't have clear sections beyond that. The coherence score might still be 4 because the overall argument is clear, even if some parts are confusing.

Fluency: The errors and archaic language deduct points, but the overall sentence structure is mostly sound. So maybe 3.5, but since we have to use integers, 3 or 4. Considering the errors are minor but present, and the style is formal but sometimes awkward, I'll go with 3.

Coherence: Despite some disruptions and repetition, the narrative builds towards the claim. The structure is mostly logical. So 4.

Wait, the explanation needs to reflect both. Let me check again. The fluency has some issues but is generally okay. The coherence has a clear overall structure but some flaws. So FINAL Coherence Score: 4, FINAL Fluency Score: 3.

The text exhibits a formal, somewhat archaic writing style with lengthy, complex sentences that occasionally impede readability due to grammatical errors (e.g., "admirirg," "scientest") and awkward phrasing. While vocabulary is rich and sentences are largely structured correctly, fluency is hindered by outdated terminology ("antldiluvians") and a garbled, unintelligible passage mid-text.  

Coherence is stronger, with a clear narrative arc: the author introduces a discovery, grounds it in biblical context, and elaborates on geographical claims. Transitions between ideas (e.g., shifting from scriptural analysis to physical descriptions) are mostly logical, though repetition ("our garden is right") and abrupt shifts (e.g., discussing snakes) slightly disrupt flow. The central argument remains cohesive, even if supporting details feel overly elaborated.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
