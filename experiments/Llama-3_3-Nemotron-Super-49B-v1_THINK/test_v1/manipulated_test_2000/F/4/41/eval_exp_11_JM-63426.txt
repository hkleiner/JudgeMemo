Okay, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The user wants me to evaluate fluency and coherence. 

First, fluency. I need to check if the sentences are well-written and grammatically correct. Looking at the text, there are some typos like "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "werebknown" which should be "were known". Also, "emriched" should be "enriched". These errors affect fluency. The sentences are mostly clear, but the mistakes pull the score down. Maybe a 3 or 4?

For coherence, the structure is good. The introduction sets up Bradley's impact, then the second chapter tells his backstory. Each part builds on the previous. However, there's a jump from the introduction to the childhood story without a clear transition. The story flows within each chapter but the connection between chapters could be smoother. Also, some parts like the detail about Theodore Roosevelt feel a bit out of place. Coherence might be a 4.

Wait, but the two chapters are distinct parts of the book, so maybe the transition is intentional as separate sections. The coherence within each chapter is strong. The overall structure makes sense, telling Bradley's influence and then his background. The fluency issues are mainly typos, but the writing style is engaging. Maybe fluency is a 4 because despite errors, the sentences are mostly well-constructed. Coherence is 4 because the overall structure works, even with minor transitions and some tangents.

The text exhibits **fluency** with mostly well-structured sentences and vivid, engaging prose, though marred by scattered typos (e.g., "seem" → "seen," "toom," "werebknown," "emriched") and minor grammatical lapses. These errors disrupt polish but do not severely hinder comprehension. **Coherence** is strong overall, with a clear two-part narrative: the introduction contextualizes Will Bradley’s impact, while "The Boy Printer" chronicles his formative years. Transitions between chapters feel abrupt, and some details (e.g., Theodore Roosevelt’s libel trial) distract slightly, but each section coheres internally. The biographical flow is logical, even if thematic connections between chapters could be tighter.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
