Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Real Presence. The author is analyzing whether the Church teaches this doctrine by examining its official documents.

Starting with fluency: The text is formal, using complex sentences and archaic language (e.g., "thou," "thee," but wait, looking back, the text actually uses "it is" and modern pronouns but with some outdated structures). There are grammatical errors like "was" instead of "were" in several places, "am" instead of "are," and inconsistent verb tenses. For example, "a blind consent is blindly give" should be "given." These mistakes disrupt the flow but the overall sentence structure is clear despite the errors.

For coherence: The text is well-structured, starting with an introduction that sets the objective, then moving to Chapter I which focuses on the Real Presence. The author contrasts Roman Catholic views with the Reformation principles, citing Church documents like Articles and the Catechism. Each section builds on the previous, creating a logical flow. However, the dense theological jargon and lengthy sentences might make it hard for non-experts to follow, but within its context, it's coherent.

So, fluency is affected by grammatical errors but sentences are mostly well-constructed. Coherence is strong in structure and logical progression. Scores: Fluency maybe 3 because of errors but good sentence quality. Coherence 4 since it's well-organized but dense.

The text exhibits formal, complex writing with a clear structure, suitable for theological discourse. **Fluency** is somewhat compromised by frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were," inconsistent verb tenses) and slightly archaic phrasing, though sentence composition remains largely coherent. **Coherence** is strong: the narrative logically progresses from introducing a debate to analyzing Church doctrines, with clear sectioning (e.g., "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION") and consistent thematic focus. However, density and theological jargon may hinder accessibility for non-specialists.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
