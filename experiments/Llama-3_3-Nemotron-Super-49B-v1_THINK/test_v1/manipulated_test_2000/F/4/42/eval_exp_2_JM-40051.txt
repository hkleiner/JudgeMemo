Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then score them from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to read the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll skim through to get the structure and content. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. The text is old-fashioned, probably from the 19th century given the language and references.

Fluency refers to individual sentence quality, grammar, and writing style. Looking at the sentences, there are many grammatical errors. For example, "had venture to published it" should be "ventured to publish." There's inconsistent verb tense, like "I is ignorant" instead of "I was ignorant." Punctuation is also erratic, with missing or misplaced commas and periods. The sentence structure is often convoluted, making them hard to follow. Despite this, the author's enthusiasm and detailed descriptions are clear, so there's some readability, but the errors drag the fluency down.

Coherence is about the overall structure and how sentences connect. The narrative jumps between biblical references, personal discovery, geographical descriptions, and defensive statements against critics. There's a clear central argument, but the flow is disrupted by tangents, like the part about the town site's history. The author uses transitional phrases but the sections feel somewhat disjointed. However, the core idea is maintained throughout, even if the presentation is messy.

For scoring: Fluency is likely a 2 because of the frequent errors but some clarity. Coherence might be a 3 since the main point is there, but the structure is poorly organized with many distractions.

**Quality Explanation:**  
The text exhibits significant challenges in **fluency** due to rampant grammatical errors (e.g., "had venture to published," "I is ignorant"), inconsistent verb tenses, and convoluted sentence structures that disrupt readability. While the authorâ€™s fervor and descriptive detail occasionally shine through, the writing is marred by punctuation inconsistencies and awkward phrasing.  
**Coherence** is partially maintained by a central thesis (locating Eden near the Mississippi), but the narrative is fragmented by tangents (e.g., critiques of town proprietors, snake anecdotes), abrupt shifts between biblical analysis and geography, and defensive asides. Transitions are weak, and subpoints often feel disconnected from the broader argument, though the overall claim persists throughout.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**
