Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. First, I need to read the story carefully. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about individual sentence quality, grammar, and how smoothly they read. The text is from the 19th century, judging by the style and some words like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians). The sentences are long and complex, with archaic language. There are some grammatical issues, like missing articles ("a stuff" instead of "stuff" or a specific noun), and unclear terms ("the thing" appears multiple times without explanation). Typos like "admirirg" instead of "admiring" and "scienctest" for "scientist" are present. Despite the complexity, the sentences mostly make sense, but the archaic tone and errors affect readability.

Now coherence: This is about the overall structure and how well the ideas flow. The story starts with the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American Northwest, supported by biblical references and geographical descriptions. The structure is somewhat logical, moving from introduction to biblical context, then to the location and features. However, there are abrupt shifts, like the sudden mention of "the thing" without context, and some paragraphs feel disconnected. The author jumps between describing the landscape, biblical quotes, and personal anecdotes (like Mr. Dovile's snakes). The conclusion about the garden's beauty and the decline of snakes due to Christians feels a bit tacked on. Despite this, the central argument is clear, even if the presentation is meandering.

For scores: Fluency is lower because of the errors and archaic language making it harder to follow. Coherence is mid-range since the overall structure exists but with notable disconnections and unclear references. 

Fluency: 3 (some clarity but many issues)
Coherence: 3 (logical at times but with significant flow problems)

**Explanation of Quality:**  
The text exhibits **fluency** challenges due to its archaic 19th-century prose, overly complex sentence structures, and frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "admirirg," "scienctest," inconsistent article usage). While individual sentences often convey meaning, readability is hindered by antiquated vocabulary ("antldiluvians," "a stuff") and unclear terms ("the thing"). **Coherence** suffers from disjointed transitions between biblical interpretations, geographical descriptions, and anecdotal evidence (e.g., snakes in Trempealeau). Though the central claim (locating Eden in the Mississippi Valley) is clear, the narrative meanders, relying on unsubstantiated assumptions (e.g., linking river names to biblical "euphony") and abrupt shifts in focus (e.g., from snakes to Christian settlement). Structural logic is partially maintained but weakened by ambiguity and lack of clear thematic progression.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
