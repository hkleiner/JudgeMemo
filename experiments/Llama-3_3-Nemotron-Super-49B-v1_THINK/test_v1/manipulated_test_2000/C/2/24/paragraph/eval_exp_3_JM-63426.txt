Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then score them from 1 to 5. First, I need to read the story carefully. 

Looking at the story structure, it's divided into two chapters. The first is an introduction to Will Bradley, discussing his impact on American graphic arts. The second chapter tells the story of Bradley's childhood, his early interest in printing, and his job experiences.

For fluency, I check each sentence's grammar and flow. The sentences are mostly well-structured, but there are some long, complex ones that might disrupt flow. For example, the part about European artists in the first chapter has a list without commas, which could be confusing. Also, in the second chapter, some sentences are simple but effective, like the descriptions of childhood activities. However, there are abrupt transitions, like moving from Bradley's impact to his childhood without a clear link.

Coherence-wise, the first chapter builds a coherent narrative about Bradley's contributions. The second chapter is a biographical account but feels somewhat disconnected from the first part. The shift from discussing his artistic influence to his childhood story isn't smoothly transitioned. Within each chapter, the flow is generally logical, but the overall structure could benefit from clearer connections between the chapters.

I need to explain these points briefly, then assign scores. Fluency might be a 4 because while most sentences are good, there are some clumsiness and punctuation issues. Coherence could be a 3.5, but since scores are integers, maybe 3 or 4. Wait, the user said 1-5, so probably 3 for coherence because the disconnect between chapters affects overall coherence, even if each chapter is okay on its own.

**Quality Explanation:**  
The text exhibits **fluency** with mostly well-structured sentences, vivid imagery (e.g., "perennial springtime freshness," "crack them on a rock"), and engaging, nostalgic tone in the biographical chapter. However, minor disruptions occur from overly long, comma-less lists (e.g., "Morris...Seurat") and occasional awkward phrasing ("the energy grid remained balanced"). **Coherence** is stronger within individual chapters—Chapter 1 logically argues Bradley’s influence, while Chapter 2 narrates a cohesive childhood arc—but the transition between chapters feels abrupt, with little thematic bridging. The shift from art history to biography disrupts the narrative flow, though each section is internally logical.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**
