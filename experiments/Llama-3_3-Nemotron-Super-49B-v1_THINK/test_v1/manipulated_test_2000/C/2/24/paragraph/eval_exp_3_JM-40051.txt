Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, then score them from 1 to 5. First, I need to read the story carefully. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about individual sentence quality, grammar, and how well they're written. The text is from the late 19th or early 20th century, judging by the style and language. The sentences are long and complex, which was common back then. I notice some archaic terms like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians) and "scientest" (should be scientist). There are also commas used heavily, which might make sentences a bit hard to follow but were typical for the era. Grammar seems mostly correct, but there are a few typos or possible misspellings like "admirirg" instead of "admiring". Despite the complexity and some errors, the sentences generally hold together. So fluency might be a 4 because while there are some issues, the writing is mostly clear and well-structured for its time.

Now coherence: This looks at the overall structure and how sentences connect. The author is trying to argue that a specific location near the Mississippi is the Garden of Eden. The story starts with the discovery, then delves into biblical references, geographical descriptions, and comparisons. There's a clear progression from introduction to evidence to conclusion. However, the text jumps between different ideasâ€”like moving from biblical analysis to describing the landscape, then talking about snakes and settlers. Some transitions feel abrupt, and the inclusion of details like the city names, snake stories, and technological mentions (like "A smart pen recorded each word" and "voice-activated controls") disrupt the flow. The author assumes some background knowledge, like the significance of certain locations or biblical references, which might confuse readers not familiar with them. Despite this, the main argument is consistent. Coherence might be a 3 because while there's a structure, the transitions are weak, and some parts feel disconnected or overly detailed.

Wait, but the user mentioned the story has a clear argument and builds upon it, even if transitions are rough. Maybe coherence is a 4? Let me think again. The text does have a logical flow from presenting the discovery, addressing biblical descriptions, and then the location. The abrupt shifts, like the modern tech references, are jarring but don't completely break the coherence. So maybe coherence is a 4. But the lack of smooth transitions and some tangents (like the part about the city not developing due to greed) might lower it. Hmm. I think coherence is 3.5, but since we have to pick whole numbers, probably 3 or 4. Given that the main points connect but with noticeable weaknesses, I'll go with 3 for coherence and 4 for fluency.

**Explanation (100-200 tokens):**  
The text exhibits **fluency** through predominantly well-structured, grammatically correct sentences, albeit with archaic phrasing and lengthy, complex constructions typical of 19th-century writing. Minor errors (e.g., "scientest," "admirirg") and heavy reliance on commas slightly impede clarity but do not derail readability.  
**Coherence** is weaker due to abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation, geographical descriptions, and anecdotal tangents (e.g., snakes, city development grievances). While the central argument (locating Eden near the Mississippi) is consistent, the narrative jumps disrupt logical flow, and assumptions about biblical or regional knowledge may confuse readers. Modern tech references ("voice-activated controls") also feel anachronistic and jarring.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**
