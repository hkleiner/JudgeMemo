Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores with bullet points for issues. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a historical theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The text is quite long and dense, written in a formal, somewhat archaic style.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about sentence structure, grammar, repetition, and clarity. The text uses complex sentences, which might make it less fluent for modern readers. I notice some long, winding sentences that could be split for better flow. For example, the first chapter has sentences with multiple clauses. Also, there's repetition in ideas, like the constant distinction between the Church of England's views and Roman Catholic teachings. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate, but some terms like "transaccidentation" might be obscure. Grammar seems mostly correct, but there are a few places where commas could improve clarity. No major spelling issues spotted.

Now coherence. Coherence looks at how well the text holds together logically. The structure is clear with chapters and topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter focuses on a point, citing Church documents. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The author repeats the main point frequently, which helps but might feel redundant. There's a clear logical progression from examining Articles to Catechism to Homilies, showing thoroughness. However, the text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the Church of England's documents and historical context, which might confuse readers without that background.

For fluency issues, I'll list complex sentence structures, some repetition, and occasional lack of clarity in long sentences. For coherence, the main issues are the assumption of background knowledge and somewhat abrupt transitions between sections discussing different documents.

Scoring: Fluency is mostly good but has some hindrances. The complex sentences and minor clarity issues might make it a 4. Coherence is strong in structure but weak in accessibility due to assumptions, so maybe a 4 as well, but need to check the scales carefully. Wait, the coherence scale says a 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. Given the text's logical flow but some abruptness and heavy assumptions, maybe 4.5? But the user allows half-points. Fluency, despite some complexity, is still clear overall, so maybe 4.5 for fluency too. But need to ensure the issues don't drop it lower. Let me verify the criteria again. Fluency 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues," which fits. Coherence 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," which also fits. So scores might both be 4.5, but let me check again. The text is well-structured, but the heavy theological jargon and historical references without explanation might affect coherence for some readers, but the author's logic is clear. So maybe coherence is 4.5 because the structure is strong but accessibility is a minor issue. Fluency is 4.5 due to sentence complexity but overall clarity.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences may impede readability.  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "thou," "thee") and specialized theological terms (e.g., "transaccidentation") require contextual knowledge.  
- [REPETITIVENESS] Reiterated distinctions (e.g., Church of England vs. Rome) occasionally feel redundant.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Assumes prior familiarity with Church of England documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) and historical context.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analyzing specific documents (e.g., jumping from Article 28 to the Catechism).  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs and minimal transitional phrases.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
