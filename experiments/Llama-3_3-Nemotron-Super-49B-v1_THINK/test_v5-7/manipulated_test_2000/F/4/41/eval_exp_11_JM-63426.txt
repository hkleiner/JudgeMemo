Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores with bullet points for issues.

First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's two chapters from a book about Will Bradley. The first chapter is an introduction, and the second is about his early life as a boy printer.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, lexicon. Looking for errors or awkward phrasing. Let me check for any obvious mistakes. In the first chapter, I notice "seem" should be "seen" in "before I had seem the book’s text itself." That's a spelling/grammar error. Then "toom" instead of "room" in "a closed and stuffy toom Bradley entered". Also, "werebknown" should be "were known". "therecderivative" has an extra 'c'? Wait, the text says "There werecderivative traces"—probably a typo, maybe "were derivative". Then "prss" instead of "press" multiple times. In the second chapter, "om" instead of "on" in "schoolhouse om Baltimore Street". "coveref" should be "covered". "aremsitting" instead of "are sitting". "cemts" is cents. "rethrn" instead of "return". "prss" again. "qant" should be "want". "esucation" is education. "lay og" instead of "layout of". "boioer" might be "boiler". "towan" instead of "town". "prdss" for press. "frequently" misspelled as "freauently". "boardcand" should be "board and". "make-up” time is okay, but maybe a formatting issue? Not sure. Lots of typos here. So under fluency, these are [SPELLING] and [GRAMMAR] issues. The text has many typos which disrupt reading, but the structure of sentences is mostly okay. So fluency score would be lower, maybe 3, because while the overall flow is readable, the frequent typos are distracting.

Now coherence. Coherence is about how well the text holds together logically. The first chapter discusses Bradley's impact, then jumps to European influences and his unique American style. The transition between paragraphs seems logical. The second chapter is a biographical account of his childhood, which is coherent within itself but maybe a bit detailed. However, the two chapters are separate, but since they're labeled as chapters, that's expected. Within each chapter, the ideas flow. Maybe some abrupt shifts, like in the second chapter when moving from school to working at the press, but overall it's structured. So coherence issues might be minor. Maybe [STRUCTURE] for some transitions, but not major. Score for coherence could be 4, as mostly coherent with a few minor disconnects.

Wait, but the user provided a long text. Let me check again. In the first chapter, the author talks about Bradley's work, then discusses European movements, then contrasts with Bradley's approach. That's logical. The second chapter is a detailed childhood story, which is clear. However, some parts might feel a bit too detailed (like the food descriptions), but they contribute to the narrative. So coherence is good. Fluency is affected by the typos but not the sentence structure. So FINAL Fluency Score: 3 (multiple errors but still readable). Coherence Score: 4 (mostly logical, minor issues).

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seem" → "seen", "toom" → "room", "werebknown", "coveref", "cemts", "rethrn", "prss", "qant", "esucation", "boioer", "freauently", "boardcand").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "my part should be little more than the opening of a door").  
- [TYPO] Repeated errors in word choice (e.g., "prss" for "press").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Some abrupt scene shifts in Chapter 2 (e.g., from school to working life) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed anecdotes (e.g., food, clothing) slightly slow narrative focus.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
