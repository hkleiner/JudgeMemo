Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully and identify any issues related to fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the Church of England's doctrine, so it's formal and somewhat archaic. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon. I notice some very long sentences that could be split for better flow. For example, the part starting with "That the material food..." has a jumbled structure with repeated phrases like "the soul" and "the body" without clear transitions. There's also a section that seems garbled: "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This looks like a possible typesetting error or missing words, causing confusion. No obvious spelling mistakes, but some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whosoever") which is appropriate for the context but might slightly impede modern readers. Syntax is mostly correct but overly complex in places.

Now coherence. The text is structured with chapters and clear headings, which helps. The author outlines the objective in the introduction and follows through by examining Church documents. However, there are abrupt shifts, like moving from discussing Scripture to the Church's documents without a smooth transition. The comparison between Rome's and the Church of England's views is clear, but the paragraph about the Church's current state ("That dear old Church...") feels somewhat out of place, breaking the flow of the doctrinal analysis. Transitions between ideas could be better; for example, after explaining the Reformation principles, the shift to analyzing the Articles could be signaled more clearly. The logical progression is generally there, but some sections repeat ideas (e.g., emphasizing the distinction between visible signs and invisible gifts multiple times) which might make the text slightly less cohesive.

Scoring fluency: The main issues are complex sentences and the garbled paragraph. Despite that, the text is mostly readable. I'd say Fluency is a 4 because while there are minor issues, they don't disrupt readability much. 

Coherence: The structure is good, but there are some transitions and tangents. The points are mostly connected, but not perfectly. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since the overall logic holds but has a few weak spots.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences hindering readability. - [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "whosoever") and repetitive phrasing ("the soul" / "the body"). - [SYNTAX] Garbled, incoherent sentence structure (e.g., "That the the of two..."). - [STRUCTURE] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Scriptural discussion to Church documents. - [STRUCTURE] Tangential comment about the Churchâ€™s contemporary state disrupts focus. - [LOGIC] Repeated assertions without clear progression (e.g., visible/invisible gift distinction).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
