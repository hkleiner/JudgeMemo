Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to spot any issues.

First, fluency. Fluency is about grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, and how natural the text sounds. I notice a lot of grammatical errors. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." There's "when they come to discuss terms" which should be "came." Also, "the ghost has am see" doesn't make sense; it should be "has been seen." Then "which she never really recover" needs "recovered." 

In the dialogue, "you'dded have it" is probably a typo for "would have it." "It may had resisted" should be "may have resisted." "who do not quite understood" is incorrect grammar; it should be "who did not quite understand." There are multiple subject-verb agreement issues like "Mr. Otis have telegraphed" instead of "had telegraphed." Also, "the twins, who am usually called" should be "are." Tenses are inconsistent, like "was scared" instead of "were scared." 

Spelling mistakes: "peal of thunder" is correct, but maybe "peal" is intended here. "Cheroot" is spelled correctly. "Paragon Detergent" and "Pinkerton's" seem correct. 

Syntax issues: Some sentences are structured awkwardly, like "It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always made its appearance before the death of any member of our family." The placement of "in fact" is a bit odd. 

Lexicon: The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but some word choices might be off, like "amused family" instead of "admired." 

Now coherence. The story flows logically from the introduction of the haunted house to the family's experiences. However, there are abrupt transitions, like moving from the family's arrival to the description of the twins without a clear connection. The character of Mrs. Umney is introduced suddenly without much context. The shift from Chapter I to II isn't marked clearly in the text provided. Some parts feel a bit disjointed, like the conversation topics before the ghost appears don't lead smoothly into the event. 

Also, the character reactions sometimes feel inconsistent. For example, Mr. Otis's calm response to the ghost might not fully align with previous skepticism. The twins being called "The Star and Stripes" is cute but feels like a non-sequitur. 

So for fluency, the numerous grammatical errors and tense inconsistencies would lower the score. Despite that, the text is mostly readable, so maybe a 3. For coherence, the overall structure is logical, but there are some disconnected parts and transitions, so maybe a 4.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "everyone tell him," "they come," "Mr. Otis have telegraphed").  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies (e.g., "was scared," "had seen").  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "you'dded," "recovered").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact").  
- [LEXICON] Word choice anomalies (e.g., "amused family" instead of "admired").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., introduction of twins, Chapter II opening).  
- [TRANSITION] Weak connections between dialogue and subsequent events (e.g., conversation topics before ghost appearance).  
- [LOGIC] Minor character inconsistency (e.g., Mr. Otisâ€™s overly calm ghost interaction).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
