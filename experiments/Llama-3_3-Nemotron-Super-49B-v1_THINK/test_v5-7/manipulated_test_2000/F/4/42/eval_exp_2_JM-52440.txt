Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read the text carefully and note down any issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the Church of England's doctrine, so it's formal and old-fashioned. I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "was" instead of "were" in several places, like "a blind consent is blindly give" should be "given". Also, subject-verb agreement issues, such as "those who was loyal" should be "were". There are repeated verb tense inconsistencies, like switching between past and present tense. The syntax is sometimes awkward, like "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion" could be clearer. Lexical choices might be archaic but not incorrect, so maybe not a big issue here.

For coherence, the structure is mostly logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. However, transitions between ideas could be smoother. The author jumps between discussing Scripture and the Church's documents without clear connectors. There's some repetition, like reiterating the importance of examining Church documents multiple times. The main points are clear, but the detailed explanations might confuse readers due to complexity and length of sentences.

Now, scoring. Fluency: Despite errors, the text is mostly readable. The mistakes are noticeable but don't disrupt understanding too much. So maybe a 4? But the frequent "was" errors and tense issues might bring it down to 3.5. 

Coherence: The overall structure is good, but transitions are weak and some parts are hard to follow. Repetitions and complex sentences affect coherence. So maybe a 3.5 as well. Wait, the criteria say Score 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues". Since the text is mostly logical but has some disjointed parts, maybe 3.5 is right.

Wait, let me check the scales again. Fluency Scale: Score 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues". The errors here are more than minorâ€”there are multiple subject-verb errors and consistent "was" mistakes. So maybe 3.5 is better for fluency. Coherence: The text has a clear objective but lacks smooth transitions and has some confusing segments, so 3.5 as well.

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "those who was loyal", "a blind consent is blindly give")  
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tense shifts (e.g., "was examined", "would be found")  
- [SPELLING] Archaic vocabulary ("was" instead of "were" in plural subjects, repetitive phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation and Church documents (e.g., Chapter I jumps without clear connectors)  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive assertions (e.g., emphasis on examining Church texts)  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multi-clause explanations of sacramental views)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
