Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence. First, I need to read through the text carefully to spot any issues.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, lexicon, etc. Looking at the text, there are several grammatical errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "It should be talked about." Also, "realized" should be "realize." Then there's "demolish" which should be "demolished." In the second chapter, "was know" is incorrect—it should be "were known." "Take off" is correct, but "take" without "off" might be better, but not a major issue. "We have never have" is a double negative; should be "have never had." "Bradley may had" is incorrect subjunctive; should be "might have had" or "may have had." "It don’t worked" is wrong tense and subject-verb agreement; should be "didn't work." "Spoke to thousands" is correct, but "spoke" might need an object. "Was" used incorrectly in many places, like "when you was hungry" should be "were." "Picklelime" might be a typo for "pickle lime." "Ate" instead of "eat" in "ate clam chowder." Lots of subject-verb issues, like "children grow" should be "children grow" (actually correct, but maybe context matters). "Couldn’t afforded" missing "not." "Was on the Narrow Gauge" should be "were." "Was sucked" to "were sucking." "Was found" to "were found." "Was made" to "were made." "Was troubled" is correct, but "was" used excessively. "You are put to worked" should be "were put to work." "Received your first lesson in feeding" might be unclear—maybe "feeding the press"? "The two jobbers are kicked" is unclear; maybe "were kicked out"? "Was" instead of "were" again. "You are now a worked man" should be "a working man." "Depend upon it" is okay, but "it" refers to what? Maybe "them." "You are sorry" is correct, but "were sorry" might be better. "He has am a kind teacher" should be "was." "You are now twelve" is okay. "Was responsible" correct. "Frequently" is fine. "You went out" tense consistency? "Operated the press" correct. "Heated (?) with one stove" maybe a typo or uncertainty. "You went to worked" again incorrect. "Forage" might be the right word, but contextually okay. "Got kindling" should be "get." "The Peninsula Record... printed one page at a time" is a bit awkward but understandable. "You are not that important" is correct. "After paying board and bought" should be "after paying board and buying." "In ’85 a man’s wages" is a bit informal but acceptable. "Traveled fakers" maybe "traveling." "Their advance was always heralded by the exchanges" unclear—maybe "advertised"? "Keep away" is a command, but in context, maybe "warned to stay away." "Iron Ore print shop is on the ground floor" abrupt transition. "His desk is at the big window" okay. "Make-up time" probably typesetting. "A faker is selling soap" okay. "He pretends to place a five dollar bill" scam description. "Strums a guitar and sings" okay. "Attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare" a bit awkward. "Mr. Newett walks leisurely to where there was several guns..." "was" should be "were," and "several guns and fishing rods" maybe "some."

For coherence, the text seems mostly connected, but there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from discussing Bradley's impact to the European art scene feels a bit disconnected. Also, in the second chapter, the narrative jumps between different events in the boy's life without clear transitions. Some parts, like the description of the faker, seem to end abruptly without tying back to the main point. However, overall, the story follows a logical timeline, even if some sections are vivid but not fully integrated.

Now, assigning scores. Fluency has many errors but the text is still readable. Maybe a 3 because there are multiple issues but not so bad you can't understand. Coherence is generally okay but with some disjointed parts, so maybe a 4.
