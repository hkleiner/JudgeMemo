Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully to identify fluency and coherence issues. The text is quite long, so I'll have to go through it step by step.

Starting with fluency. Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, lexicon, etc. The text has a lot of archaic language, like "thou" and old spellings, but maybe that's intentional for the style. However, there are some clear grammatical errors. For example, "had venture to published it" should be "ventured to publish." Also, "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" – "CHAPTER" in all caps seems odd here, maybe a typo. 

In the sentence "When God made man to dwelt on the face of the earth," "dwelt" should be "dwell." There are subject-verb agreements issues too, like "I is ignorant." Tenses are inconsistent sometimes, like "had been" and "woulded have been" which isn't a word. Spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "minded" (meant?), "was being settle" (settled). Syntax issues like "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" – "has am" doesn't make sense. Repetitive phrases, like repeated mentions of the garden's beauty without varying language.

Now coherence. The text jumps between biblical references and geographical descriptions. Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, moving from discussing the Bible to the author's discovery feels abrupt. Some ideas are repeated, like the uniqueness of the location, without clear progression. The logic in some arguments is weak, such as assuming the absence of mineral wealth is a virtue without explanation. The structure is somewhat disorganized, with descriptions of the landscape interspersed with biblical interpretations without a clear flow.

Scoring fluency: There are multiple errors but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are issues, it's not completely unintelligible. 

Coherence: The overall structure is there, but with noticeable disjointedness and weak transitions. Maybe a 3? It's generally coherent but has several problems that affect the flow.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had venture to published it" (verb tense inconsistency)  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "minded" (meant?)  
- [SYNTAX] "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" (illogical construction)  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "wilt") and inconsistent modern usage  
- [REPEETITIVENESS] Repetitive phrases (e.g., "our garden is right")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biblical interpretation and geographical description  
- [LOGIC] Weak causal links (e.g., equating lack of mineral wealth with moral virtue)  
- [TRANSITION] Poor paragraph connections (e.g., shift from discovery to Trempealeau town history)  
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose descriptions hindering focus on central argument  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
