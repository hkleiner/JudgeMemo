Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully and identify any fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the 19th century, so the language is somewhat archaic. Words like "thus," "whence," and "aforementioned" might affect readability for modern readers, but they're grammatically correct. I notice some long, complex sentences, which could make fluency a bit lower. For example, the sentence starting "The practical conclusion is the same..." is quite long and has multiple clauses. However, the structure is mostly clear. There are no obvious grammar or spelling mistakes, so fluency is probably high but not perfect due to sentence length and antiquated vocabulary.

Now for coherence. The text is well-structured, starting with an introduction, then moving to Chapter I. The author clearly states the objective and outlines the points to investigate. Transitions between ideas are logical, like moving from discussing Scripture to the Church of England's documents. However, there's some repetition, such as reiterating the importance of examining the Church's own documents. Also, the shift from theological discussion to the Church's current state (e.g., "That dear old Church is at this present time...") might feel a bit abrupt, but it's still connected to the main point. The coherence is strong overall, with a clear logical flow, but minor transitions could be smoother.

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly fluent with some minor issues from complexity and outdated language. Maybe a 4.5? But since the issues are noticeable, perhaps 4.

Coherence: Very coherent with a clear structure, but some minor abruptness and repetition. Score 4.5 seems right.

1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "aforementioned," "whence") may reduce readability for modern readers.  
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The practical conclusion is the same...")  
   - [REPEAT] Mild redundancy in emphasizing the importance of examining Church documents.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting from theological debate to the Church’s contemporary challenges.  
   - [STRUCTURE] Minor repetition in reiterating the investigation’s focus.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
