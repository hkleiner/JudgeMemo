Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the text's fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully.

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some repeated phrases like "a thing" which seems like a placeholder. That's definitely a fluency issue under LEXICON because it's a vocabulary choice problem. Also, in the second chapter, there are sentences that are a bit long and winding, which might affect SYNTAX. For example, the part about the express wagon and paying five cents—those sentences are a bit convoluted. 

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different time periods in Bradley's life without clear transitions. Like moving from his impact on art to his childhood story without a smooth link. That's a STRUCTURE issue. Also, some parts feel disconnected, like the detailed description of his childhood activities which, while vivid, don't always clearly connect to his later career themes. There's a LOGIC issue there because the narrative doesn't always logically flow from one point to the next.

Scoring fluency: The "a thing" placeholders are annoying but not too frequent. The syntax issues are minor but present. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has noticeable minor issues.

Coherence: The structure has some jumps, and transitions are weak. The overall narrative is understandable but has some disjointed parts. So maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally coherent but with some noticeable problems.

1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Repeated placeholder "a thing" (e.g., "a thing, Massachusetts", "at the thing corner") disrupts specificity and clarity.  
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week.") with abrupt transitions between clauses.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between historical context (Chapter 1) and biographical anecdotes (Chapter 2) without clear thematic bridges.  
   - [LOGIC] Overly detailed childhood vignettes (e.g., lobster feast, circus day) feel tangentially connected to Bradley’s artistic impact.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
