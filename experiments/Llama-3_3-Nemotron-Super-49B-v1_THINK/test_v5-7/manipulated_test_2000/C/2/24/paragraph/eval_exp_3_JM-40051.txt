Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the specified criteria.

First, I'll start by reading through the text to get a general sense. The text is quite lengthy, written in an older style, maybe 19th century. The author is arguing that a specific location near the Mississippi River is the Garden of Eden based on biblical descriptions and geographical features.

For Fluency: I need to check grammar, syntax, lexicon, spelling, etc. The text has some archaic language and long sentences, which might affect readability. I noticed a few spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "scietist" (scientist), "Bridtish" (British), "consitutes" (constitutes). Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, which could hinder flow. There's repetition in describing the beauty of the location, but that's part of the rhetorical style. Grammar seems mostly correct despite the antiquated structure.

For Coherence: The structure is a bit meandering. The author jumps between biblical references, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions. There's a clear overall argument, but transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing the garden's location to talking about snakes feels abrupt. However, each section does contribute to the main claim, even if the connections aren't always explicit.

Scoring Fluency: Despite the errors and complex sentences, the text is mostly readable. The mistakes are minor and don't overwhelm the understanding. So maybe a 4? But the frequent archaic terms and lengthy sentences might push it to a 3.5? Wait, the scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." The errors here are minor but present, and the phrasing, though old-fashioned, is clear. So Fluency score 4.

Coherence: The text has a clear thesis but lacks smooth transitions and has some tangents (like the part about the city not developing due to greed). However, the overall logic holds, connecting the location to biblical criteria. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Wait, but the author's structure is a bit disjointed. The sections on snakes and the city's development might not fully integrate. But the main points are connected. Maybe Coherence is 3.5? Because while the overall message is there, the transitions and some segments disrupt the flow noticeably. The scale says 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." So maybe 3.5 for Coherence.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor issues, mostly fluent), Coherence 3.5 (some disruptions but overall clear).

1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "scietist", "Bridtish", "consitutes" - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "having become thoroughly satisfied...") - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("dimentions", "pleasantry") - [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing commas in lists)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., snakes in "hanging garden" section) - [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated leaps (e.g., linking settler activity to serpent disappearance) - [TRANSITION] Repetitive descriptive asides (e.g., beauty of names/place)  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
