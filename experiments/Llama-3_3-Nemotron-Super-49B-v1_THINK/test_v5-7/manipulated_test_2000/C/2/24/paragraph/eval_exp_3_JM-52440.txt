Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to evaluate the text based on fluency and coherence. The text is from a religious tract, probably 19th century given the style. 

Starting with fluency. The language is formal and somewhat archaic, which might affect readability. I notice long sentences, like the one in the introduction that goes on for several clauses. That could make it hard to follow, so maybe a [SYNTAX] issue. Also, some words like "whilst" or "thou" might be considered less common, but the text mostly uses standard English. Grammar seems mostly correct, but there's a repetition in phrases like "it is... that" which could be [REPEITITION]. 

For coherence, the structure is clear with chapters and topics outlined. The author sets a goal in the introduction and follows through, examining each point systematically. However, the transition between paragraphs might be abrupt. For example, after discussing the Church of England's documents, there's a sudden mention of the Church's current state without a clear link. That's a [TRANSITION] issue. Also, some paragraphs are very long, which might disrupt flow, leading to [STRUCTURE]. 

Scoring fluency: The text is mostly readable but has some awkwardness from long sentences and minor repetitions. So maybe a 4? But the archaic language might deduct a bit. Wait, the criteria say "common English usage." If the vocabulary is less common, that's a [LEXICON] issue. But the examples given in the scale for 4 include minor grammatical issues. Since the main issue is sentence structure and some word choice, maybe 4.0 or 4.5? 

Coherence: The overall structure is logical, but there are some jumps and long paragraphs. The points are connected, but transitions could be smoother. So maybe a 4 as well, but if the transitions are noticeable, perhaps 3.5? 

Wait, the evaluation for coherence score 4 says "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The text has clear progression but some abrupt shifts. So maybe 4.0 for coherence. Fluency, despite some syntax and lexicon issues, is mostly fluent, so 4.0 as well. 

But let me check again. The fluency issues are mainly syntax (long sentences) and some lexicon (archaic terms). The coherence has structure and transition issues. So maybe fluency is 4.0 and coherence 4.0. Or if the coherence issues are more pronounced, maybe 3.5. 

Wait, the example in the introduction has a very long sentence with multiple clauses. That's a [SYNTAX] issue. Also, the word "whilst" is less common but not incorrect. The repetition of "it is... that" could be [REPEITITION]. 

For coherence, the main issue is the lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and long paragraphs, which affects [STRUCTURE] and [TRANSITION]. But the overall logic is there. So coherence might be 4.0 because the weaknesses are minor. 

Final decision: Fluency 4.0 (some syntax and lexicon but mostly fluent), Coherence 4.0 (mostly coherent with some structural/transitional flaws).

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences hindering readability. - [LEXICON] Use of less common, archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst," "thou"). - [REPEITITION] Repetitive phrasing ("it is... that").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Excessively long paragraphs disrupting flow. - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., discussing Church documents to its modern state).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
