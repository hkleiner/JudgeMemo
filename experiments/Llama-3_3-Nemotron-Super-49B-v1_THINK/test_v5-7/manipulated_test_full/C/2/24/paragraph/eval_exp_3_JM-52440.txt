Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. The text is a historical theological discussion from the Church of England's perspective on the Lord's Supper, specifically addressing the Real Presence doctrine. The author is analyzing Church documents to argue against the Real Presence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency concerns grammar, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text is formal, 19th-century style, which might have complex sentences but is generally clear. I notice some long sentences, but they're structured properly. No obvious grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary is rich and appropriate for theological discourse. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 5, but need to check for any minor issues.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connectivity. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author uses Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) systematically. Each part builds on the previous, with clear transitions. However, the text is dense and assumes some background knowledge of the subject, which might make it less accessible, but that's not necessarily a coherence issue. The structure is logical, so Coherence score could be 5, but maybe minor deductions if some parts feel repetitive or too detailed.

Wait, the user mentioned some random phrases like "A keyboard clicked without being touched." These seem out of place. Are those part of the original text or errors? Looking back, the text has inserts like "A keyboard clicked..." which disrupt the flow. These are likely errors or misplaced sentences. That would affect both Fluency and Coherence. For Fluency, under Syntax or maybe LEXICON if it's a terminology issue. For Coherence, under STRUCTURE or TRANSITION because they interrupt the logical flow.

So revising Fluency: Despite formal language, the random tech phrases are jarring. That's a major issue. So Fluency score might drop to 4, considering those disruptions. Coherence also affected because these inserts break the argument's flow. Coherence score might be 4 as well, since the main structure is good but these errors disrupt it.

Wait, the evaluation criteria for Fluency include being "non-repetitive" and "clear meanings." The random phrases are not repetitive but definitely disrupt clarity. So Fluency Issues would include [SYNTAX] or [STRUCTURE] for those interruptions. Coherence Issues might include [STRUCTURE] or [TRANSITION] for the same reason.

Also, checking if the text has other issues. The author sometimes uses lengthy paragraphs, but that's common in older texts. No repetition noticed in arguments, though the points are thoroughly defended. 

So finalizing:

Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Interrupting phrases (e.g., "A keyboard clicked...") disrupt sentence flow.
               - [STRUCTURE] Some long sentences, but given the style, maybe not a major deduction without the errors.

But the main Fluency issue is the random phrases. So Fluency score: 4 (mostly fluent but notable minor issues).

Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Random phrases disrupt logical flow.
                 - [TRANSITION] Sudden tech references without context.

Coherence score: 4 (mostly coherent but some disruptions).

Alternatively, if the random phrases are considered more severe, maybe Fluency 3.5 and Coherence 3.5. But given the rest of the text is well-structured, perhaps 4 for both.

Wait, the evaluation scale for Fluency 4 is "mostly fluent... minor issues... noticeable but don't disrupt readability." The random phrases are noticeable and do disrupt a bit, but the rest is very fluent. So Fluency 4.

Coherence 4: "mostly coherent, few weak parts." The main structure is clear, but the random phrases cause minor disruptions. So Coherence 4.

But I need to list the issues in bullet points. For Fluency, the main issue is the syntax due to those phrases. For Coherence, structure and transitions.

So:

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Disruptive, unrelated phrases (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched") interrupt flow.
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Random technological references disrupt thematic coherence.
                  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt insertions lack contextual connection.

Scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 4.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
