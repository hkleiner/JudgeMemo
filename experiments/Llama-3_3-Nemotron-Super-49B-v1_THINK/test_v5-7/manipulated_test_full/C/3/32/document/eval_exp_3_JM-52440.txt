Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, using the specified criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a religious treatise from the Church of England discussing the Lord's Supper, Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, probably from the 19th century given the style and references (like Dr. Pusey, who was active then).

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about grammatical correctness, non-repetitiveness, and clarity. The text is mostly well-structured with complex sentences, which is typical of older theological writings. However, there are some long, winding sentences that might make reading difficult. For example, the opening paragraphs have sentences with multiple clauses. Also, there are archaic terms like "a thing" which seems to be a placeholder for "Church" or similar, possibly due to a formatting error. These could cause confusion. Additionally, repeated phrases like "the thing" instead of "the Church" might be typos or placeholders, disrupting fluency.

Now coherence. Coherence is about how well the text holds together logically. The author outlines a clear structure: Introduction, chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice, each referencing Church documents. The transitions between chapters are logical, and each point is supported by citations from Articles, Catechism, etc. However, the text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrines and historical context, which might make it hard for non-experts to follow. There's also some repetition in emphasizing the distinction between spiritual and material elements, but it's used for emphasis rather than being redundant.

For fluency issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and possible errors like "a thing".
- [REPEAT] Some repetitive phrasing for emphasis, but not excessively.

Coherence issues:
- [ASSUMPTION] Assumes reader familiarity with specific documents and history.
- [TRANSITION] While mostly clear, some sections jump between documents without clear connectors.

Scores: Fluency is mostly good but has some issues, so maybe 4. Coherence is strong in structure but has assumptions, so maybe 4 as well. Wait, but the criteria for 4 in fluency allows minor issues. The archaic language and errors might bump it down to 3.5? But the text is generally readable. Coherence, despite assumptions, is well-organized, so maybe 4.5? But the assumptions might make it a 4.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Excessively complex sentence structures. - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and possible typographical errors (e.g., "a thing"). - [REPEAT] Mild repetition for emphasis.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [ASSUMPTION] Assumes deep prior knowledge of Church of England documents and historical context. - [TRANSITION] Occasional abrupt shifts between referenced sources.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
