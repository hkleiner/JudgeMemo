Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on Fluency and Coherence, then give scores for each. Let me start by reading through the text again to get a sense of the structure and any issues.

First, Fluency. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, written in a somewhat old-fashioned style, which might be intentional given the subject's time period. I notice there are a lot of specific details and names, which could make it dense but not necessarily unfluent. However, there are some long, winding sentences. For example, in the "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION," the first paragraph has a complex sentence structure with multiple clauses. That might affect readability. Also, terms like "the thing" repeated frequently seem like placeholders or redactions, which disrupt the flow. These could be errors or omissions in the text provided.

Next, Coherence. The text is divided into chapters, which helps structure. Each chapter seems to focus on a different period of Bradley's life. However, the transitions between chapters might be abrupt. For instance, moving from his childhood to his career in Chicago without a clear link. Also, the use of "the thing" repeatedly where proper nouns should be might confuse the reader about context, affecting overall coherence.

For Fluency Issues:
- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentences (e.g., first paragraph of Introduction)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "gaiety, courage, vitality", "stout", "lubricity")
- [SPELLING/OMISSIONS] Repeated "the thing" placeholders indicating missing information

For Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter transitions without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Overuse of "the thing" obscures specific references
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between life stages

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly readable but has notable issues. The syntax and lexicon might make it a bit challenging, but it's not severely impaired. Maybe a 4? But the placeholders ("the thing") are distracting. Wait, those are more about content than fluency. Fluency is about sentence structure, grammar, etc. So maybe the syntax and lexicon issues bring it down to 3.5? But the main fluency issues are the complex sentences and some archaic terms, which are manageable. Maybe 4 because while there are issues, they don't completely hinder understanding.

Coherence: The structure is there with chapters, but the transitions are poor, and the missing terms cause confusion. So maybe 3.5? It's generally coherent but with noticeable problems.

Wait, the evaluation criteria for Coherence 3 says "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts... affect the reading experience." That fits. So Coherence score 3.5?

But the user said to use half-points. Let me check the scales again.

Fluency Scale:
- 5: Highly fluent, minimal issues.
- 4: Mostly fluent, minor issues.
- 3: Readable but multiple grammatical/structural issues.
Here, the text has some complex sentences and archaic language, but no grammatical errors mentioned. The "the thing" issues are more content/coherence. So maybe Fluency is 4, as the main flaws are stylistic rather than grammatical.

Coherence Scale:
- 5: Highly coherent, logical progression.
- 4: Mostly coherent, few weak parts.
- 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable issues.
The text has chapters but abrupt transitions and unclear references due to "the thing". So Coherence is 3.

Wait, but the repeated "the thing" affects clarity, which is part of coherence. So maybe Coherence is 3.5? Because while the overall structure is there, the missing info causes confusion. But according to the scale, 3 is "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable...". Yes, that fits. So 3 for Coherence.

Finalizing:
Fluency: 4 (mostly fluent, some minor stylistic issues)
Coherence: 3 (generally coherent with some notable issues)
</think>

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures - [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or overly formal vocabulary 

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters - [CLARITY] Frequent redactions ("the thing") obscure context - [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit links between life stages 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3 

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
