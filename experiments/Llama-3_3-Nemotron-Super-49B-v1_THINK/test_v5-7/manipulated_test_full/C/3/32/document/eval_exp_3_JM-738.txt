Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then provide scores. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a long piece about Dickens's unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and various theories about its conclusion.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about sentence structure, grammar, phrasing, and readability. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. I notice some long, complex sentences that could be hard to follow. For example, there are sentences with multiple clauses and old-fashioned vocabulary like "thou" or "whilst." Also, there are parenthetical remarks and quotes without clear integration, which might disrupt flow. Are there any grammatical errors? Scanning through, I see proper grammar mostly, but some commas might be misplaced, or sentence structures are convoluted. 

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect, logical flow, and overall structure. The text jumps between different theories (Proctor, Walters) and includes excerpts from the book, analysis, and external evidence like Forster's letters. The transitions between these sections could be smoother. There's a lot of back-and-forth between theories without clear headings, making it a bit disjointed. Also, the inclusion of the cover design analysis feels a bit abrupt. The author assumes some background knowledge of Dickens and the novel, which might confuse readers not familiar with it.

For fluency issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and terms (e.g., "thou", "whilst").
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear paragraph breaks or transitions between ideas.

For coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear presentation of theories without clear sectioning.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analysis, evidence, and theories.
- [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of the novel and its context.

Scoring: Fluency might be a 3.5 because while there are no major errors, the complexity and archaic style hinder readability. Coherence is around 3 due to structural issues and assumptions of background knowledge.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "whilst," "thou") - [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear paragraph breaks or transitional phrases between ideas  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Non-linear, disjointed presentation of theories without clear sectioning - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between analysis, external evidence, and speculative theories - [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with *Edwin Drood*â€™s context and Dickensian tropes  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
