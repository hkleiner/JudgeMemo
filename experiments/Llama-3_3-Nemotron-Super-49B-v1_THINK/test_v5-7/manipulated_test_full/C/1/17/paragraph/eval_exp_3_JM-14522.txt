Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want me to rate the fluency and coherence of the given text based on specific criteria. The text provided is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how well the sentences flow, grammar, syntax, etc. Since Wilde's writing is from the late 19th century, the language is formal and somewhat archaic. However, the criteria mention "common English usage," so I need to consider if the text's style affects readability for a modern reader. The text has complex sentences and old-fashioned vocabulary, but it's structured well. There might be some repetition or awkward phrasing due to the period's writing style, but overall, it's highly fluent. Maybe a few minor issues but nothing distracting. So Fluency Score would be 5.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about how well the whole text hangs together logically. The story has a clear structure: introduction, ghost's attempts, Virginia's interaction, resolution. The chapters flow logically, and the themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistent. However, there are some tangents, like the sudden insertion of unrelated paragraphs (e.g., the adaptation of animals, Mr. Cuming Walters' guess, the taxi scene). These disrupt the flow. Also, some character introductions (like the little Duke) feel a bit abrupt. But overall, the main narrative is coherent. The tangents might be considered weaknesses. So Coherence Score might be 4, as there are a few weak parts but not significantly disruptive.

Now, listing the issues. For Fluency: Maybe some archaic terms or complex sentences, but they don't hinder understanding. Coherence: The unrelated paragraphs and some abrupt scene changes. 

Wait, looking back, the text included some random paragraphs that seem pasted incorrectly, like "The adaptation of animals to the elements..." and "Mr. Cuming Walters guesses..." and "One arises in the morning...". These are clearly not part of the original story and disrupt coherence. If those are part of the text to evaluate, they're major coherence issues. But maybe they were errors in the input. Assuming they are part of the text, then Coherence would be lower. However, in the actual story by Wilde, those parts aren't present. So perhaps the user included incorrect text. But since I have to evaluate the given text as is, those sections would cause Coherence issues. 

But the original "Canterville Ghost" doesn't have those sections. The user might have pasted extra text by mistake. However, the task is to evaluate the provided text. So if those paragraphs are included, they are major coherence issues. For example, the part about animals and the Filipino dinner section break the narrative flow completely. So Coherence Score would drop to 3 because of these unrelated inserts. 

But I need to check the text again. The user provided a long text starting with "THE CANTERVILLE GHOST" and chapters I to VII, but then there are sections like "2. The adaptation of animals..." and "One arises in the morning..." which don't belong. These are likely errors. If the task is to evaluate the entire text as given, including those errors, then Coherence is affected. However, if those are mistakes in the input, maybe the actual text is just the story. But since the user included them, I must consider them. 

Given that, the coherence issues would include those unrelated paragraphs. So Coherence Score would be 3. Fluency might still be 5 if the main text is fluent, but the extra parts could affect fluency too if they have errors. However, the extra parts seem like pasted errors without fluency issues in themselves, just coherence. 

So final scores: Fluency 5, Coherence 3. But need to list the issues accordingly.
</think>

1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "thou," "whilst") and complex sentence structures may slightly challenge modern readers. - [SYNTAX] Rare instances of verbose phrasing (e.g., "the most punctilious honour").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated paragraphs (e.g., "The adaptation of animals...," "One arises in the morning...") disrupt narrative flow. - [TRANSITION] Sudden, unexplained scene shifts (e.g., taxi, Filipino dinner). - [LOGIC] Non-sequiturs (e.g., Mr. Cuming Waltersâ€™ guess) lack contextual integration.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 5
