Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the text carefully and identify issues with fluency and coherence. The text is quite long, so I'll have to be systematic.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about individual sentence quality: grammar, syntax, repetition, clarity. The text is from the 19th century, so some archaic language is expected, but errors or awkwardness that hinder understanding are issues.

Looking at the text, there are some obvious grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph: "when God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary and disrupts flow. Also, "in no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as..." seems garbled. The syntax here is confusing, maybe missing words or misplaced phrases.

There's repetition in ideas. The author repeats "Come and see!" multiple times, which might be intentional for emphasis but could be seen as redundant. Also, long, winding sentences make it hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting "When God formed the earth into a globe..." is very long and complex.

Now coherence. Coherence is about the text making sense as a whole, logical flow, transitions. The text jumps between describing the garden, biblical references, geographical details, and personal anecdotes. There's a lack of clear structure. The author moves abruptly from talking about the garden's location to discussing cyclones, then to geological age, without smooth transitions.

The main argument—that this location is the Garden of Eden—is presented, but supported with various unrelated points (e.g., dairy farming success, lack of cyclones) that don't strongly connect. The text assumes a lot of background knowledge (e.g., biblical references, geological terms) without explanation, which might confuse readers.

Also, there are contradictions or unclear points. For instance, the author claims the area is exempt from cyclones but mentions that thunderstorms occur. The explanation about cyclones being broken by the terrain seems speculative and not clearly linked.

For scoring, Fluency: Despite some archaic style, the numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and repetition drag it down. Maybe a 3? Coherence: The text is generally readable but has major issues with structure, transitions, and relevance of points. Maybe a 2.5?

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Frequent comma splices, misplaced punctuation (e.g., "He, evidently"), and incomplete sentences (e.g., "in no continent flood to it any that which...").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "When God formed the earth...").  
- [REPETITION] Repeated phrases ("Come and see!") and ideas (e.g., beauty of the garden).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("antideluvians," "muff") without clarification.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear topical organization; abrupt shifts between geography, biblical interpretation, and personal anecdotes.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor connections between paragraphs (e.g., jump from cyclone discussion to dairy farming).  
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., cyclone exemption due to terrain) and weak biblical correlations.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with 19th-century geological terms and biblical geography.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
