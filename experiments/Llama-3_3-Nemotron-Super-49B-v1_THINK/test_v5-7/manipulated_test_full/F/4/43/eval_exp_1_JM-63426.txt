Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, then score them. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a biography of Will Bradley, divided into chapters. The text seems to be written in a somewhat old-fashioned style, which might be intentional given the subject's era.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about sentence quality, grammar, phrasing, and readability. I notice some long, complex sentences that might be hard to follow. For example, in the "CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION," there's a sentence: "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." That looks garbled, maybe a typo or a missing word. That's a clear grammar/spelling issue.

Also, there are abrupt transitions between ideas. Like in "CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING," the narrative jumps from his childhood to later events without smooth connections. That affects coherence. Coherence is about how well the text hangs together logically.

Looking for other fluency issues: Repetitive phrases? Not really. But some sentences are wordy. For example, "The contrast of that natty blue-serge with my striped bed-ticking apron should have made me self-conscious." While not ungrammatical, it's a bit verbose. 

Coherence issues: The text has many chapters, each a vignette. Sometimes the connection between chapters isn't clear. For example, moving from his childhood to working in Chicago without a clear link. Also, some paragraphs seem disjointed, like the part about the faker selling soap and the editor shooting the kerosene tank. It's a vivid anecdote but feels out of place without context.

Scoring: Fluency. The text has some major errors (like the garbled sentence), but mostly it's readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? Because while there are issues, the overall flow is maintained except for those spots.

Coherence: The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt shifts and lack of clear transitions between some sections. However, each chapter individually makes sense. The overall narrative is mostly followable but has weaknesses. So coherence score might be around 3 as well, since it's generally coherent but with notable lapses.

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Severe sentence fragmentation (e.g., "It about state and it...") with missing/incoherent wording.
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "I explained... that I had not contemplated undertaking any outside work").
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("gaiety," "emancipation stuffy," "pi") and outdated phrasing ("you will want to be an artist and there will be no money for your education").
- [SPELLING] Possible typos (e.g., "fleeting" instead of "fletching" in craft context).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected vignettes (e.g., shift from childhood to adult career without bridges).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear chronological or thematic linking between chapters.
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the Nineties were years of leisurely contacts" without context).
- [LOGIC] Non-sequiturs (e.g., description of editor shooting a kerosene tank with no narrative integration).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.0**  
   (Generally readable but with frequent disjointed shifts and unclear connections between ideas.)

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**  
   (Mostly clear despite archaic tone, but marred by critical grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in key sections.)
