Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the text carefully. It's a historical theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The text is quite long, so I'll have to skim through to identify key points.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency looks at grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, and overall readability. The text seems to be from the 19th century given the style and vocabulary. There are some archaic terms like "thou" and "thee", but that's expected. I notice some typos, like "Taughtvby" (should be "Taught by"), "ans" (and), "vlindly" (blindly), "anybsuch" (any such). These are minor but frequent. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability, but they're structured properly. Grammar and syntax seem mostly correct despite the outdated language. So Fluency issues would be minor typos and complex sentence structure, but overall fluent.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about logical flow, structure, transitions. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author builds an argument step by step, citing Church documents. Transitions between ideas are clear, like moving from Articles to Catechism to Homilies. However, the text is dense and assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and historical context, which might make it hard for some readers to follow. But within its target audience, the structure is logical. So Coherence issues might be the dense nature and assumptions of background knowledge, but overall coherent.

Scoring: For Fluency, despite some typos and complexity, it's mostly fluent. Maybe a 4. Coherence is well-structured but dense, so maybe 4 as well. Wait, the criteria for 4 in Fluency is "mostly fluent with minor issues not disrupting readability." The typos here are minor but present, and the complexity might make it a 4. For Coherence, "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The density and assumptions might be a weak point, but overall logical. So both scores could be 4. But let me check again.

Fluency Issues: Typos (e.g., Taughtvby, ans, vlindly), complex sentences. But no major grammar errors. Score 4.

Coherence Issues: Assumes theological background, dense sections. But logical structure. Score 4.

Wait, the user's example in the problem had a text with some issues but scored 4 and 4. This text is more formal and structured. Maybe even a 4.5 for Coherence if the structure is very clear. But given the density, maybe 4.0. Similarly, Fluency with typos but otherwise clear: 4.0.
</think>

1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "Taughtvby," "vlindly," "ans") - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, archaic sentence structures - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "thee") but contextually appropriate  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Assumes theological/historical context without explanation - [CLARITY] Dense, verbose paragraphs requiring close attention  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.0**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
