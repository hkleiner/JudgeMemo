Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided text carefully. It's a historical theological treatise from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The author is arguing against the Real Presence doctrine, citing Church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, with complex sentences and old-fashioned language (e.g., "thou", "thee"). There might be grammatical issues, like "we was taught" instead of "we were taught". Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, affecting readability. For example, the sentence starting "But those who are loyal..." has multiple clauses and could be split for clarity. However, the vocabulary is rich and appropriate for the subject matter. No spelling errors noticed, but archaic terms might cause confusion for modern readers.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author logically builds the argument by referencing different documents in sequence. Transitions between sections are generally smooth, but some paragraphs are dense and require close attention. The main points are well-supported with quotes from the Articles and Catechism, maintaining a logical flow. However, the text assumes prior knowledge of theological debates, which might make it less accessible to some readers.

For Fluency score: Despite some grammatical slips and archaic style, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. So maybe a 4.

Coherence score: The text is well-organized and coherent, with each chapter focusing on a specific aspect. The use of authoritative sources strengthens the argument. However, the density and assumed background knowledge might cause some coherence issues for less familiar readers. Still, overall coherence is strong, so maybe a 4.5.

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Occasional archaic verb conjugations (e.g., "we was taught") and minor inconsistencies in pronoun use. - [SYNTAX] Extremely lengthy, complex sentences requiring re-reading for clarity. - [LEXICON] Formal, outdated vocabulary (e.g., "thou," "thee") but appropriate for historical context.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Assumed prior knowledge of theological debates may hinder accessibility. - [CLARITY] Dense paragraphs with layered theological arguments require concentrated attention. - [TRANSITION] Subsections within chapters could benefit from clearer topic signposting.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
