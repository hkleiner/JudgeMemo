Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by recalling the criteria. Fluency is about individual sentence quality—grammar, syntax, clarity, and natural phrasing. Coherence is about how the whole text hangs together logically and how well the ideas connect.

First, looking at fluency. The text is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which is a classic, so I expect high fluency. But I need to check for any issues. The writing is formal, Victorian style, with complex sentences. I notice some long sentences, but they're structured well. Are there any grammatical errors? The text provided seems correct—maybe some archaic language like "had been went" but that's period-specific, not an error. So fluency issues might be minimal, maybe some minor points for very long sentences affecting flow slightly. Score around 5, but maybe 4.5 if there's a slight distraction from very long sentences.

Now coherence. The story is well-structured, each chapter builds on the previous. The themes of the ghost's attempts and the family's reactions are consistent. Transitions between chapters are smooth. However, there are a lot of characters and some subplots (like the Duke's proposal, the jewels), but they all tie into the main story. The only possible issue might be the length and the number of events, but since it's a multi-chapter text, that's expected. Maybe a minor point for some abrupt scene changes within chapters, but overall very coherent. Coherence score probably 5.

Wait, but in the evaluation, the user provided the entire text. Let me check again. Are there any jumps in logic or unclear parts? The ghost's character development is clear, the family's skepticism turning to acceptance, Virginia's role—all connects well. The prophecy and the garden of death tie up nicely. So coherence is strong. Fluency, given the style, is highly fluent despite some length. So maybe Fluency 5, Coherence 5. But let me check the exact criteria.

Fluency Scale: 5 is highly fluent, minimal issues. The text has no errors, natural phrasing for its time. So 5.

Coherence Scale: 5 is highly coherent, logical progression. The story flows perfectly, all elements connect. So 5.

But wait, the user might have included the entire novel, but the task is to evaluate the given text. Since it's a well-known work, the issues would be minimal. So final scores: Fluency 5, Coherence 5. But maybe the fluency has some minor deductions for very long sentences or archaic vocabulary that might slightly impede modern readers, but according to the scale, if errors are rare and don't distract, it's 5. Since there are no errors, just style, it's 5. Coherence is definitely 5.

1) Fluency Issues: - [STYLE] Some sentences are lengthy and complex, reflecting Victorian narrative style, but no grammatical or syntactical errors.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor thematic detours (e.g., historical asides about the ghost’s past), but all elements serve the narrative arc.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
