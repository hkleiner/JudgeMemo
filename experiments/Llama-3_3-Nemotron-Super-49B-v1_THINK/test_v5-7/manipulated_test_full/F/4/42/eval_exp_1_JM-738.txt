Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on Fluency and Coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. The text is an analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang. It discusses various theories about the plot, characters, and Dickens's intentions.

First, for Fluency. Fluency is about sentence-level grammar, syntax, lexicology, etc. I notice that the text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might be because Andrew Lang was writing in the late 19th or early 20th century. There are long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of “The Signalman” in _Mugby Junction_." The structure is mostly clear, but some sentences are hard to follow due to their length and embedded clauses.

Checking for grammar issues: I see a few possible errors. For instance, "he woulded excuse himself" should be "would excuse." Also, "we do know that education had been denied to them" seems okay, but "we have learned that in childhood she had dressed as a boy when she ran away from home" is correct. Maybe some subjunctive mood issues, like "if he were Edwin" instead of "if he was Edwin," but that's more style than error. The vocabulary is formal and rich, with terms like "fictitious convention," "unfantastic," which are correct but might make the text less accessible.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between discussing character motivations, analyzing scenes, and presenting different theories (Proctor, Walters, etc.). The structure is somewhat meandering, with sections like "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY" that feel like they start new topics without clear transitions. However, each section does relate to the overall mystery. The author assumes the reader is familiar with the original novel and its characters, which might cause confusion for those not acquainted with "Edwin Drood."

Coherence issues might include abrupt shifts between topics. For example, moving from discussing Grewgious's actions to introducing Datchery without a clear link. Also, the lengthy discussions of different theories (Proctor vs. Walters) could be better signposted. The text relies heavily on references to Forster, Collins's drawings, and other external elements without fully explaining them, which might disrupt coherence for some readers.

Scoring Fluency: Despite some complex sentences and archaic language, the text is mostly grammatically correct. The few errors (like "woulded") are minor. I'd rate Fluency as 4, because while it's mostly fluent, the complexity and occasional errors might deduct a point.

Coherence: The text is generally coherent but has some disjointed sections and assumes background knowledge. The structure could be clearer, but the overall argument follows a logical path through different theories. I'd rate Coherence as 3.5, as it's understandable but with noticeable issues in transitions and assumptions.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "If I am right, Dickens went further...").  
- [LEXICON] Formal vocabulary may impede readability for modern readers (e.g., "unfantastic," "seducing").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "woulded excuse" instead of "would excuse").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theory discussions (e.g., shifting from Grewgious to Datchery without clear links).  
- [ASSUMPTION] Assumes reader familiarity with *Edwin Drood* and external references (e.g., Forster, Collins’s designs).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit signposting between thematic sections (e.g., "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
