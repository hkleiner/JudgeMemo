Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria: Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The story provided is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I know this is a classic, so I expect high fluency. Checking the text, the sentences are complex but structured well. There are some archaic terms and witty dialogue, which is typical of Wilde's style. However, I notice a few grammatical errors in the provided text, like "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him", "when they come" instead of "came", and "had am see" which should be "had been seen". These are likely typos in the given version, not the original. Despite these, the overall flow is smooth, syntax is mostly correct, and word choice is excellent. So Fluency score would be high, maybe 5, but considering the errors, perhaps 4.

Now Coherence. The story unfolds logically from the introduction of the haunted house, the Otis family's skepticism, to the ghost's appearances. Each chapter connects well, building the narrative. The characters' interactions and the progression of events (bloodstain, ghost encounter) are clear. There's no abrupt jumps or confusion. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistently woven. However, the transition between chapters might feel a bit abrupt without headings, but since they are labeled, it's okay. Coherence is strong, so score 5.

Wait, but the user provided text has some inconsistencies in verb tenses and typos. But since the task is to evaluate the given story as is, not assuming the original, those errors affect Fluency. So Fluency: 4 due to the mistakes, Coherence:5 because the structure is solid despite errors.

Analysis: The story exhibits high coherence with a logically structured narrative, consistent character interactions, and clear thematic progression. However, fluency is slightly impacted by noticeable grammatical errors (e.g., "every one tell him," "had am see"), tense inconsistencies, and archaic phrasing that occasionally disrupts modern readability. 

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
