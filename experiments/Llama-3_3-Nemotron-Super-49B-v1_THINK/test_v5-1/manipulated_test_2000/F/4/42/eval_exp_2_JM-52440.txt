Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence, then provide feedback and scores from 1 to 5.

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., ensuring smooth reading. Coherence is about the structure, logical flow, connectivity between ideas, and consistency.

Looking at the story, it's a religious text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure is formal with chapters and sections. The language is old-fashioned, with archaic spellings and grammar (e.g., "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are"). There are several grammatical errors like "blind consent is blindly give" and inconsistent verb tenses. These affect fluency because they cause pauses and require re-reading.

For coherence, the text is well-structured with a clear introduction stating the objective. It outlines the plan to examine Church documents and proceeds logically through points. However, the dense theological concepts and lengthy sentences might make it hard to follow for some readers. The author connects ideas by referencing previous statements and using transitional phrases, maintaining coherence despite complexity.

So, Fluency score: The errors and archaic language disrupt smoothness, but the overall structure is clear. Maybe a 3? Because while there are mistakes, the text is still understandable with effort.

Coherence score: The narrative is well-organized, each part builds on the last, and the author's goal is clear. Despite some complexity, the logic holds. So maybe a 4.

Now, crafting the feedback. For Fluency, mention the grammatical errors and archaic style but note that the structure is clear. For Coherence, highlight the logical progression and clear objectives but note the density of content.

Scores: Fluency 3, Coherence 4.

Analysis: The text exhibits formal structure and logical progression, with clear objectives stated in the introduction. However, numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were," inconsistent verb tenses) and archaic phrasing ("am" for "are") disrupt fluency. Coherence is maintained through sequential argumentation and thematic focus, though dense theological discussions may impede readability for non-specialists.  

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
