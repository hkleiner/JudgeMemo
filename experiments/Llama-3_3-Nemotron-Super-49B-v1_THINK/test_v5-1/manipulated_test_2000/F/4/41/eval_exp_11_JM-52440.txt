Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the criteria.

Fluency focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is from the 19th century, so some archaic language is expected, but I should check for errors. Scanning the text, I notice some typos like "unvommon" (should be uncommon), "best-establisjed" (best-established), "confidenve" (confidence), "ifmthey" (if they), "srrvice" (service), "businesbis" (business is), "tue" (the), "prssent" (present), "wnd" (and), "invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen" (archaic but correct). Despite these, the overall flow is good. The language is formal and complex, but sentences are structured well. Fluency score might be 4, considering the typos but good overall structure.

Coherence looks at how the story unfolds logically, connections between ideas, clarity, and structure. The text is a theological argument with a clear introduction stating the objective, then Chapter I delves into the Real Presence. The author outlines the controversy, references Scripture and Church documents systematically (Articles, Catechism, etc.), and contrasts views. The structure is logical: problem statement, examination of sources, comparison of doctrines. However, the density of theological concepts might make it hard to follow for non-experts, but within its context, it's coherent. Coherence score is likely 5 because the argument is well-organized and each part connects to the next.

Wait, but the user mentioned "story" but this is a non-fiction theological text. Maybe "story" here refers to the narrative structure of the argument. The coherence is strong in presenting a structured inquiry. So yes, Coherence 5. Fluency 4 due to typos but otherwise fluent.

Analysis: The text demonstrates strong coherence with a logically structured argument, clear objectives, and systematic examination of theological concepts. However, minor typos (e.g., "unvommon," "businesbis") and archaic phrasing slightly impact fluency, though the formal tone and sentence structure remain largely effective.  

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
