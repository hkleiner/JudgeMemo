Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence, then provide feedback and scores. First, I need to read through the story carefully.

Starting with Fluency: I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The story has some obvious typos like "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "emriched" instead of "enriched", "esucation" instead of "education". There are also missing articles and small errors like "cement" instead of "cents", "lirtle" instead of "little". These mistakes disrupt the smooth reading flow. However, the sentence structure is mostly clear, and the vocabulary is rich and appropriate. So Fluency is affected by the errors but not severely in terms of overall understanding.

Now Coherence: The story is divided into chapters. The first chapter introduces Will Bradley's impact, and the second narrates his childhood. The connection between the chapters isn't immediately clear—maybe the introduction sets up his importance, and the second chapter provides backstory. However, there's a jump from discussing his professional impact to his childhood without a clear transition. Within each chapter, the narrative flows logically, with chronological events. But the overall structure could be smoother, and some parts feel abrupt, like the shift from his father's advice to moving to Michigan. Also, the ending with the editor and the faker seems cut off. So Coherence is good within sections but lacks strong connections between parts and has some abrupt transitions.

Scoring: Fluency gets a 3 because while there are errors, the text is mostly readable. Coherence is a 4 since the internal logic is good but the overall structure has issues.

Analysis: The story exhibits generally clear sentence structures and engaging vocabulary, contributing to decent fluency. However, numerous typos (e.g., "seem" → "seen", "emriched"), inconsistent spacing, and minor grammatical errors (e.g., "in our state of emancipation") slightly disrupt smooth reading. Coherence is strong within individual chapters, with logical chronological progression, but the transition between chapters feels abrupt, and the narrative concludes somewhat abruptly without fully resolving introduced elements (e.g., the faker scene).  

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
