Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence, then provide a feedback and scores from 1 to 5.

First, I need to understand the criteria again. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., ensuring smooth reading. Coherence is about the logical flow, consistency, no ambiguities, etc.

Looking at the story, it's an old-style text, probably from the 19th century given the language and references (like "Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT"). The author is arguing that a specific location between La Crosse and Winona is the Garden of Eden, matching biblical descriptions.

For Fluency: The text has archaic language (e.g., "thoroughly satisfied", "princopak facts" which might be a typo for "principal"), long sentences, and some spelling errors ("antldiluvians", "locayion", "admirirg", "prlper", "inhabited", "explanatikn"). There are also punctuation issues, like inconsistent spacing and missing commas. However, despite these, the text is mostly readable. The word choice is formal but sometimes awkward. So Fluency might be a 3 because while there are errors, the overall flow isn't severely hindered.

For Coherence: The structure starts with the author's discovery, then delves into biblical justification, location details, and scenic descriptions. The narrative jumps between personal anecdotes (talking to friends, publishing in a newspaper) and geographical descriptions. There's some repetition (emphasizing the location's beauty and biblical matches) but the main argument is clear. The author connects each part logically, even if the transitions could be smoother. However, the inclusion of details like the snake story and city names might feel a bit disjointed but serves to support the claim. So Coherence might be a 4 because the overall structure holds, even with some minor jumps.

Wait, but the text has some abrupt shifts, like moving from biblical analysis to describing the hanging garden's snakes. Also, the part about the city of La Crosse and the lumber mills feels tacked on. But the core idea is consistently developed. Maybe Coherence is still a 4. 

Fluency, considering the errors but overall readability, maybe a 3. Coherence, despite some jumps but logical progression, a 4.

Feedback should highlight the archaic language and errors for Fluency, and the mostly logical structure with some minor disconnects for Coherence.

Analysis: The text exhibits archaic language, sporadic spelling/grammar errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "locayion"), and overly complex sentence structures, slightly impairing fluency. However, the narrative remains broadly readable. Coherence is strong, with a clear central argument (locating Eden) and logical progression from biblical interpretation to geographical description, despite minor thematic jumps (e.g., abrupt snake anecdote) and repetitive emphasis on beauty/providence.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
