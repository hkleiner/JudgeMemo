Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria again. 

Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. So I need to check if the text flows smoothly without errors. The story provided is a theological text from the Church of England, written in a formal, somewhat archaic style. The language seems proper with correct grammar and spelling. The sentences are complex and long, which might affect readability but not fluency in terms of errors. There's a mention of "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" and "The biosensor updated its readout" which are abrupt and out of context. These might be errors or placeholders, disrupting the flow.

Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, clarity, and structure. The text is structured with chapters and clear headings. The introduction sets up the topic, and Chapter I delves into the Real Presence. The author outlines the debate, contrasts views, and references Church documents systematically. However, those random tech sentences break the coherence. Without those, the narrative is well-structured and logically progresses. The abrupt jumps from theological discussion to modern tech terms are major coherence issues.

So for Fluency: The main text is fluent, but the random sentences cause errors. Maybe score 4 because the majority is correct, but those errors exist.

For Coherence: The structure is good, but the tech inserts cause abrupt jumps. Maybe 3 because the main content is coherent, but those parts disrupt it.

Wait, but the user might consider those tech lines as part of the story or errors. If they're part of the story, they're very disruptive. If they're errors, then Fluency and Coherence are both affected. Since the user provided the story as-is, I have to evaluate based on what's given. Those lines are definitely out of place, so they harm both scores.

Revising: Fluency might be 3 if those lines are considered part of the text, introducing errors. Coherence also 3 because the main structure is okay but interrupted. Alternatively, if the tech parts are mistakes, maybe the rest is fluent and coherent. But since they're present, they affect the scores. 

Final decision: Fluency 4 (mostly correct but some disruptions), Coherence 3 (good structure but significant disruptions).

Analysis: The text exhibits strong fluency with formal, grammatically correct language and logical sentence structure, though some lengthy sentences may impede readability. However, abrupt, contextually irrelevant phrases (e.g., "The autonomous vehicle...") introduce minor disruptions. Coherence is generally maintained through clear thematic progression and structured argumentation, but the unexplained tech references disrupt narrative flow and create slight ambiguity in the otherwise logically sequenced theological analysis.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
