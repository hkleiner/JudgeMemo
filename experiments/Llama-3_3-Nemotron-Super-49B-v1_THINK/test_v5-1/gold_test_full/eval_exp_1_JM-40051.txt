Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand what each criterion means. 

Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads. That includes syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation. So I need to check if the sentences are structured well, if there are errors, and if the language flows without awkwardness.

Coherence is about how well the story holds together as a whole. It should have logically sequenced ideas, no repetition, smooth transitions, avoid ambiguities, and a clear structure. The narrative should be consistent and well-organized.

Looking at the story provided, it's a 19th-century style text claiming to locate the Garden of Eden in the Midwest. The language is formal and archaic. Let's start with Fluency.

The text has long, complex sentences which might make it hard to follow. There are some grammatical issues, like missing articles or awkward phrasing ("antldiluvians" probably should be "antediluvians"). There are also repetitions in ideas, like repeatedly inviting readers to "come and see." The vocabulary is rich but sometimes overly elaborate, which might hinder smooth reading. However, given the period, some archaic terms are expected. Spelling seems mostly correct, but there are typos like "admirirg" instead of "admiring." Punctuation is generally correct but dense, with many commas making sentences dense.

For Coherence, the structure is somewhat meandering. The author jumps between biblical references, geographical descriptions, and defensive arguments against critics. There's a clear central claim, but the supporting points are not always logically connected. The text repeats the main thesis multiple times without adding much new information. Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. However, the narrative does have a clear progression from introducing the discovery to describing the location and defending it. The author uses biblical quotes and geographical details to build the argument, which adds some coherence.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the challenges with sentence structure and some errors, the text is mostly readable if you're accustomed to older writing styles. The errors are present but not overwhelming. Maybe a 3 or 4? Considering the time period, maybe the fluency is better than a modern standard would require. But the long sentences and some typos might bring it down. Let's say 4 because while it's challenging, it's still comprehensible with effort.

For Coherence, the main idea is clear, but the execution is disjointed. Repetitions and lack of clear transitions reduce coherence. However, the author does link ideas back to the Bible and the location. So maybe a 3? It's somewhat coherent but could be much better organized.

Analysis:  
The text exhibits **Fluency** challenges due to overly complex, archaic sentence structures, occasional grammatical/spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg"), and dense punctuation. While vocabulary is rich, wordiness and repetition ("come and see") disrupt flow. **Coherence** suffers from meandering organization, repetitive assertions, and abrupt shifts between biblical interpretation, geography, and defensive rhetoric. However, the central thesis (locating Eden) remains clear, supported by consistent biblical and spatial references, even if transitions are weak.  

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
