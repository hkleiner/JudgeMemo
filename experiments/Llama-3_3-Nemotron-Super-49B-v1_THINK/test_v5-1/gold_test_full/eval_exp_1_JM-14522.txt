Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on Fluency and Coherence. 

First, Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. The story provided is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I know Wilde's writing is known for its wit, precise language, and flow. The text here seems to have no grammatical errors, rich vocabulary, and each sentence is well-constructed. The dialogue feels natural, especially the humorous exchanges between the Americans and the ghost. The only possible issue might be some long, complex sentences, but they're characteristic of Wilde's style and don't hinder understanding. So Fluency should be high, probably 5.

Next, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical sequence, consistency, and avoiding ambiguities. The narrative has a clear structure: introduction of the family, their encounters with the ghost, the climax with Virginia, and the resolution. Each chapter builds on the previous, and the plot points connect logically. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistent. The only slight ambiguity might be the exact nature of Virginia's time with the ghost, but it's intentionally left somewhat mysterious, which fits the story's tone. The prophecy's fulfillment with the almond tree blossoming ties things up neatly. So Coherence is also strong, likely 5.

Wait, but should Coherence be 5? Let me double-check. The story has some humorous elements and character interactions that might slightly disrupt the narrative flow for some readers, but overall, the progression is clear and engaging. The use of chapters helps in structuring. Yeah, I think both scores are 5.

Analysis: The story exhibits impeccable **Fluency** with flawless grammar, sophisticated vocabulary, and effortless sentence structure, characteristic of Oscar Wilde’s mastery. Dialogue and narrative flow seamlessly. **Coherence** is equally strong, with a logically sequenced plot, consistent themes, and symbolic resolution (e.g., the almond blossoms). While some ambiguity surrounds Virginia’s final interaction with the ghost, it aligns with the narrative’s mystical tone and does not disrupt overall clarity.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
