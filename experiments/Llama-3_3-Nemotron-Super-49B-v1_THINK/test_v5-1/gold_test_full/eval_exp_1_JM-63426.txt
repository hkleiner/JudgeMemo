Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence, each on a Likert scale of 1-5. 

First, I need to understand the criteria. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical sequencing, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections between ideas, avoiding ambiguities, and structural consistency.

Looking at the story, it's a biography of Will Bradley, structured in chapters. The writing style seems formal, maybe a bit old-fashioned, which makes sense given the historical context (written in 1954). 

For Fluency: The text is mostly well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. However, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might hinder smooth reading. The use of outdated terms (e.g., "pi" for type pieces, "Gordon press") could cause confusion for modern readers without context. Punctuation seems correct, but the lengthy paragraphs might affect fluency.

For Coherence: The story is chronological, each chapter marking a phase in Bradley's life. The structure is logical, and ideas flow well from one section to another. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like the shift from describing his childhood to detailed typographic influences without clear transitions. Also, the inclusion of the chronology and afterword might feel disconnected from the narrative chapters. Some parts, like the detailed descriptions of historical printing techniques, might be repetitive or overly detailed for some readers.

I need to weigh these aspects. Fluency might score a 4 because while there are some complexities, the overall language is correct and flows reasonably. Coherence could be a 4 as well since the structure is mostly logical, but there are some jumps and excessive detail in places.

Wait, but the long sentences and archaic terms might lower Fluency. Maybe a 3.5, but since ratings are integers, I'll decide between 3 and 4. Considering the formal tone is intentional and the audience might be expected to handle some complexity, Fluency is 4. Coherence is 4 due to the overall logical flow despite some minor issues.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 4.

Analysis:  
**Fluency:** The text is predominantly well-written with correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Sentence structure varies effectively, though some lengthy, complex sentences may impede smooth reading. Archaisms (e.g., "pi," "Gordon press") and dense typographic jargon require contextual understanding. Fluency is strong but not flawless due to occasional opacity.  
**Coherence:** The narrative follows a clear chronological structure, with logical chapter transitions. Ideas are mostly well-connected, though abrupt shifts (e.g., from biography to typographic details) and repetitive emphasis on specific influences (e.g., Caslon) slightly disrupt flow. The chronology and afterword feel somewhat appended but do not disrupt overall coherence.  

**FINAL Coherence Score:** [4]  
**FINAL Fluency Score:** [4]
