Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria properly. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, word choice, etc. Coherence is about how well the ideas are structured, logical flow, no ambiguities, etc.

Looking at the story provided, it's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure is formal with chapters and sections. The language is quite archaic, with complex sentences and old-style vocabulary (e.g., "whosoever", "thou"). 

For Fluency: The text has long, intricate sentences which might make reading challenging. There are no obvious grammar or spelling errors, but the phrasing is somewhat outdated. Word choice is appropriate for the topic but not modern. Punctuation seems correct. However, the archaic style and lengthy sentences could hinder smooth flow for contemporary readers. So Fluency might be a 4 because while it's technically correct, the style isn't fluent for today's standards.

For Coherence: The text is well-structured with clear chapters and logical progression. Each part addresses a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author references Church documents systematically. However, the topic is complex and assumes prior knowledge of theological debates, which might confuse some readers. The connections between ideas are clear, but the depth of analysis is dense. There's no repetition or abrupt jumps. So Coherence would be a 5 because the structure is logical and well-connected despite the complexity.

Wait, but the user mentioned to rate strictly based on the metrics. For Fluency, despite being correct, the archaic language and long sentences affect readability. Maybe Fluency is 4. Coherence is very strong in structure and logic, so 5.

Double-checking: Fluency criteria include syntax, grammar, word choice. The syntax is complex but correct. Word choice is formal. So maybe Fluency is 4. Coherence is excellent with clear progression and no ambiguities, so 5.

Analysis: The text exhibits formal, archaic language with complex sentence structures, which may impede modern readability despite grammatical correctness (Fluency: 4). Its logical, well-structured argumentation with clear thematic progression and consistent referencing of authoritative sources ensures strong coherence (Coherence: 5).

FINAL Coherence Score: [5]  
FINAL Fluency Score: [4]
