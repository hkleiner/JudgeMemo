Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence, each on a 1-5 Likert scale. 

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria again. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Coherence is about the logical flow, non-repetitive ideas, clear structure, and avoiding ambiguities.

Looking at the story, it's a theological text from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Real Presence. The structure is formal, with chapters and sections. The language is archaic (words like "whosoever", "thou", "thee") which might affect fluency for modern readers, but since it's a historical text, maybe that's expected. 

For Fluency: Checking for grammar and syntax errors. The text seems well-structured with proper sentence formation. However, the sentences are very long and complex, which could make reading difficult. There's consistent use of commas, semicolons, and periods, but the lengthy sentences might cause awkwardness. No obvious spelling mistakes. Word choice is formal and appropriate for the topic but might not be fluent for all readers due to complexity.

For Coherence: The narrative starts with an introduction stating the problem (people asserting the Church's doctrine without proof), then outlines the objective (examining Church documents). It proceeds logically from introduction to Chapter I, defining key points and contrasting views (Rome vs. Church of England vs. Reformation principles). The author refers to specific Articles and explains them step by step. There's a clear progression, and ideas are connected. However, the text is dense and repetitive in some explanations (e.g., emphasizing the distinction between sign and gift multiple times). The structure is clear with headings, but the density might make it hard to follow without prior knowledge.

So, Fluency: The formal, complex language and long sentences might reduce fluency, but technically correct. Maybe a 4? Because while it's correct, the flow is hindered by complexity.

Coherence: The structure is logical, points are well-connected, but some repetition and density. Maybe a 4 as well, since it's well-organized but could be clearer with more concise explanations.

Analysis: The text exhibits strong coherence with a clear, logically sequenced structure, well-defined objectives, and consistent thematic progression. However, dense theological jargon and repetitive clarifications on sacramental distinctions slightly reduce accessibility. Fluency is high in grammatical correctness and formal tone, but long, complex sentences and archaic vocabulary impede smooth readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
