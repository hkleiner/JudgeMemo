Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to recall the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical sequence, non-repetition, smooth connections, clarity, and structure.

Looking at the story provided, it's a non-fiction theological text, specifically a doctrinal analysis from the Church of England's perspective on the Lord's Supper. The structure is formal with chapters and sections, which is appropriate for the genre. 

For Fluency: The text is written in formal, somewhat archaic language (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing...", "whomsoever"), which might make it less fluent for modern readers. However, within its genre, the syntax is mostly correct. There are long sentences, but they're structured properly. I didn't notice major grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary is technical and consistent with theological discourse. So, despite the formality and complexity, the fluency is good but not perfect due to the challenging language. Maybe a 4?

For Coherence: The text is well-structured with clear chapter headings and a logical flow from introduction to examining specific doctrines. Each part builds on the previous, and the author uses transitional phrases. However, the inclusion of unrelated passages (like the parts about Dickens, Millet, George Stransom, etc.) seems out of place. These interruptions disrupt the coherence. The main argument is clear, but these inserts cause confusion. Without those, coherence would be high (maybe 5), but with them, it's lower. So perhaps a 3?

Wait, but the user mentioned the story is given, but the text includes random paragraphs. Are those part of the actual story or errors? The initial part is a coherent theological text, then there are snippets that don't fit. If those are mistakes in the input, the coherence score would suffer. Assuming they're part of the text to evaluate, the coherence is broken by unrelated sections. Hence, Coherence score lower.

So final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.

Analysis: The text exhibits strong **Fluency** due to its formal, grammatically correct structure, appropriate theological vocabulary, and consistent syntax, despite archaic tone and lengthy sentences. **Coherence** is compromised by abrupt, unrelated narrative inserts (e.g., Dickens, Millet, George Stransom passages) that disrupt the logical flow of the doctrinal argument, though the core theological analysis remains logically sequenced.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: [3]  
FINAL Fluency Score: [4]
