Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria properly.

Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Coherence is about how well the story holds together as a whole—logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth transitions, no ambiguities, consistent structure.

Looking at the story, it's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I know it's a classic, so I expect high fluency. The language is formal, with complex sentences and Victorian-era vocabulary. The structure is clear with chapters, each advancing the plot logically. The ghost's interactions with the Otis family build up consistently. 

For Fluency: The text has perfect grammar, no spelling errors. The syntax is varied and sophisticated. Word choice is excellent, contributing to the humorous and satirical tone. Punctuation is correctly used. However, some sentences are long and might feel a bit dense for modern readers, but that's characteristic of the period. So Fluency should be a 5.

For Coherence: The narrative flows well from the setup with Lord Canterville warning about the ghost, through the family's experiences, the ghost's attempts, and the resolution with Virginia. Each chapter connects logically. The themes of American vs. British culture and the ghost's decline are well-integrated. The only slight repetition might be the ghost's repeated failed attempts, but they serve to build humor and character. The story has a clear structure leading to Virginia's empathy and the ghost's peace. So Coherence is also a 5.

Wait, but the user provided the full text. Maybe there are some parts where the coherence falters? Let me check. The transition between chapters is smooth. The prophecy in Chapter V ties into the ending. The character motivations are consistent—Otis's skepticism, the ghost's pride, Virginia's kindness. The story doesn't have abrupt jumps. So yes, both scores should be 5.

Analysis: The story exhibits impeccable fluency, with flawless grammar, sophisticated syntax, and precise Victorian-era vocabulary. The narrative voice is consistent, and despite lengthy sentences, the text flows smoothly. Coherence is equally strong, with a logically structured plot, thematic consistency, and seamless transitions between chapters. Character motivations and the supernatural elements are integrated seamlessly, culminating in a resolved narrative arc.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
