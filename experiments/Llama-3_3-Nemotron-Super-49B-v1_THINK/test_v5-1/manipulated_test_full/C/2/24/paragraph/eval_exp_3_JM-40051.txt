Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on Fluency and Coherence. Let's start with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. The story is quite long, so I'll need to check for errors and awkward phrasing.

First, scanning through the text, I notice some archaic language and long sentences. Words like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians), "utilized" instead of "used", and phrases like "first know you are right, then go ahead" which is a quote but still part of the text. There are also repetitive sentences and complex structures that might make it hard to follow. For example, the author uses "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me" which is a bit formal but not incorrect. However, there are some grammatical errors like "commencing" instead of "beginning" in some places, and missing articles or incorrect prepositions. 

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the story holds together, logical sequence, no abrupt jumps, clear structure. The story starts with the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden, then goes into biblical references, describes the location in Wisconsin/Minnesota, compares it to the Bible's Eden, discusses geography, geology, and ends with testimonials and challenges to critics. The structure seems a bit meandering. The author jumps between describing the landscape, biblical analysis, responding to critics, and including testimonials from travelers. There's repetition, like multiple invitations to "come and see" and repeated descriptions of the scenery. However, each section does connect to the main claim, even if it's a bit lengthy and repetitive. The author uses transitional phrases but the overall flow is disrupted by the extensive descriptions and defensive arguments against other theories.

For Fluency, despite some archaic tone and minor errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are not overwhelming, but the word choice and sentence structure can be cumbersome. So maybe a 3 or 4? 

For Coherence, the main idea is clear, but the execution is disjointed with too much repetition and tangents. The structure isn't very logical, making it hard to follow at times. So maybe a 2 or 3?

Wait, let me think again. Fluency: The text has consistent voice, few major errors, but the style is outdated and sentences are long. Maybe 3. Coherence: The narrative lacks a clear progression, repeats points, and has abrupt shifts (like suddenly talking about geology or the devil in the M.E. society). So coherence is weaker, maybe 2.

But I need to check the criteria again. Fluency also includes phrasing and punctuation. There are some awkward phrasings, like "The scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as do the great lakes." The comparison here is a bit off. Also, punctuation seems mostly correct but could be improved for clarity. 

Coherence: The ideas are connected to the central claim, but the presentation is messy. The author jumps around topics without smooth transitions. So coherence score might be lower. 

Finalizing: Fluency 3, Coherence 2.

Analysis:  
The text exhibits **Fluency** challenges due to overly complex, archaic sentence structures and occasional grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians"), though it remains mostly readable. Word choice is formal but sometimes awkward (e.g., "utilized" for "used"). Punctuation is generally correct but fails to mitigate clumsiness in long, convoluted phrases.  
**Coherence** suffers from a disjointed narrative. While the central claim (locating Eden in the Midwest) is clear, the text meanders through biblical analysis, geographic descriptions, defensive rebuttals, and testimonials without logical transitions. Repetition ("come and see") and abrupt shifts (e.g., discussions of geology or the devil) disrupt flow, making the structure feel haphazard despite thematic consistency.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: **2**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
