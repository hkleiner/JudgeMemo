Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Fluency and Coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. It's how smoothly the text reads. Coherence is about the logical flow, non-repetitiveness, clear structure, and how ideas connect without ambiguities.

Looking at the story provided, it's a historical theological text from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The structure is formal with chapters and sections. The language is complex, with long sentences and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "thou", "thee"). 

For Fluency: The text has proper grammar and punctuation. However, the sentences are very long and dense, which might make reading challenging. There's also some archaic language that could affect modern readability. But given the period it was written, the fluency within its context is good. I might rate Fluency a 4 because while it's well-structured, the complexity and outdated terms could hinder smooth reading for some.

For Coherence: The text is well-organized with clear chapters addressing different aspects of the doctrine. Each section builds on the previous, and the author uses transitional phrases. However, the topics are deeply theological and assume some background knowledge, which might make it hard for non-experts to follow. The arguments are logically presented, referencing specific articles and documents. Coherence would be a 5 because the structure is clear, and the flow is logical despite the complexity.

Wait, but the user mentioned the story is a human-written text to be rated. Wait, the text provided is actually a non-fiction theological treatise, not a narrative story. But the task says "story", which might be a mistake. However, the user's instruction says to rate based on the given metrics regardless. So proceed as per the criteria.

Double-checking Fluency: Despite the complexity, the syntax is correct. No noticeable errors. The word choice is appropriate for the subject. So maybe Fluency is 5? But the long sentences might reduce fluency for modern readers. Hmm. Maybe 4 is better because while technically fluent, the readability is lower due to style.

Coherence: The structure is excellent, each chapter focuses on a point, references are clear. The author connects ideas well. So Coherence is definitely 5.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 5.

Analysis: The text exhibits strong structural coherence with clear chapter divisions, logical progression, and consistent referencing of authoritative documents, earning a high coherence score. Fluency is marked by correct grammar, appropriate vocabulary, and formal tone, though readability is somewhat impaired by lengthy sentences and archaic language, resulting in a slightly lower fluency score.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
