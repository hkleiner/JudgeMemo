Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Fluency and Coherence, then provide a score from 1 to 5 for each. 

First, I need to recall the criteria. Fluency is about how the text reads: syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation. Coherence is about the structure, logical flow, non-repetitive ideas, clear progression, avoiding ambiguities.

Looking at the story, it's a biographical account of Will Bradley's life, structured in chapters. The writing style is somewhat archaic, using phrases like "CHAP BOOK" with a typo ("AN INTEODUCTION" instead of Introduction). There are obvious typos like "ghe" instead of "the", "dtartling" instead of "startling", "sleel" instead of "steel", "tkme" instead of "time", "ylur" instead of "your", "ecucation" instead of "education", etc. These errors affect Fluency because they disrupt the smooth reading. The sentences are often long and winding, which might make them hard to follow, but the structure within each chapter seems logical.

For Coherence, the story is divided into chapters that follow Bradley's life chronologically. Each chapter focuses on a specific period, so the overall structure is clear. However, there are abrupt jumps in thought within paragraphs. For example, in the first chapter, the transition from discussing Bradley's impact to detailing historical European artists feels a bit disconnected. Also, some sections have repetitive mentions or tangents (like the detailed descriptions of 19th-century fashion in "THE GAY NINETIES") that might not strictly advance the narrative but add atmosphere. Despite this, the narrative mostly flows logically from one section to another.

So, Fluency would be lower due to the typos and some phrasing issues. Coherence is higher because the overall structure is good, even if there are minor flow issues within sections.

Analysis:  
**Fluency**: The text is marred by numerous typos (e.g., "INTEODUCTION," "ghe," "dtartling," "tkme"), inconsistent spacing, and archaic phrasing ("CHAP BOOK"). While sentence structure is largely clear, the errors disrupt smooth reading. Word choice and punctuation are mostly effective but occasionally awkward (e.g., "splendid anticipation" feels overly formal).  
**Coherence**: The narrative is structured chronologically with clear chapter divisions, logically tracing Bradleyâ€™s career. However, abrupt transitions (e.g., historical tangents in early chapters) and repetitive descriptive flourishes (e.g., 1890s fashion details) slightly weaken connectivity. The overall flow remains intact despite minor ambiguities.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
