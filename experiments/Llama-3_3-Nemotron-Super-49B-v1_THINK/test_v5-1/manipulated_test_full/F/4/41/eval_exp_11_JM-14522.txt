Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the story's Coherence and Fluency based on the given criteria. 

First, Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Looking at the story, there are a lot of typos and spelling errors. For example, "biught" instead of "bought", "sne" instead of "she", "alk" for "all", "spry" might be a typo for "spry young fellows" but not sure. Also, inconsistent punctuation, like missing or misplaced commas. The word choice is mostly good, but the errors disrupt the flow. So Fluency would be lower, maybe a 2 because despite the creative and engaging writing, the technical errors are plentiful.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about the story's structure, logical sequence, connections between ideas, and avoiding ambiguities. The narrative is well-structured with clear chapters, each advancing the plot. The ghost's interactions with the family are logically sequential, and the themes of skepticism vs. supernatural are consistent. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like when Virginia disappears and reappears without much buildup. Also, the ending feels a bit rushed, and some subplots (like the twins' antics) aren't fully resolved. But overall, the story hangs together well. So Coherence might be a 4, deducting for minor jumps but overall strong structure.

Wait, but the user's example had a Fluency score of 2 and Coherence 4. Let me double-check. The story has many typos, which definitely impact Fluency. Coherence is good in terms of narrative flow despite some minor issues. Yeah, I think that's right.

Analysis: The story exhibits **poor Fluency** due to numerous spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors (e.g., "biught," "sne," "alk," inconsistent capitalization) that disrupt readability. Word choice is vivid but sometimes archaic or overly elaborate, contributing to awkward phrasing. **Coherence** is stronger, with a logically sequenced narrative, clear character motivations, and thematic consistency (American skepticism vs. British tradition). However, minor abrupt transitions (e.g., Virginia’s disappearance) and unresolved subplots (e.g., twins’ antics) slightly weaken structural clarity.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: [4]  
FINAL Fluency Score: [2]
