Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to evaluate the story based on Fluency and Coherence, right? Let's start with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, looking at syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, reading through the story, I notice that the writing style is pretty old-fashioned. The author uses phrases like "I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery" which sounds Victorian or 19th-century. The structure of the sentences is often complex with long, winding sentences. For example, there's a sentence that starts with "When God made man..." and goes on for several clauses. That might make it a bit hard to follow, but it's not necessarily ungrammatical. 

Checking for grammar and spelling errors: I didn't spot any obvious mistakes. The punctuation seems mostly correct, though there are some long paragraphs which might affect readability. Word choice is formal and sometimes archaic ("antldiluvians" should probably be "antediluvians", but maybe that's a typo or an old spelling). Phrasing is mostly clear, but the constant use of rhetorical questions and exclamations ("Now, will any one believe us?") could disrupt the flow for some readers.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the story holds together as a whole. Is it logically sequenced? Are ideas connected smoothly? Are there abrupt jumps?

The story starts with the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the Northwest, then delves into biblical references, describes the location in detail, compares it to other proposed locations, and ends with testimonials and geological notes. The transitions between these sections could be smoother. For example, the shift from describing the garden's beauty to discussing Dr. Warren's North Pole theory feels a bit abrupt. There's some repetition, like repeatedly inviting readers to "come and see," which might be intentional for emphasis but could also be seen as repetitive.

The author uses a lot of geographical details and biblical quotes to support the claim, which helps in structuring the argument. However, the narrative jumps between different topics—like from scenery to responding to critics to geological age—without clear section breaks, making it a bit disjointed. The overall structure tries to build a case, but the lack of clear headings or transitions makes it less coherent.

So, for Fluency, despite the formal and sometimes cumbersome style, there are no major errors. The flow is somewhat hindered by long sentences and paragraphs, but it's still understandable. Maybe a 4?

For Coherence, the ideas are mostly connected in supporting the central claim, but the organization could be better. Transitions are lacking, and some parts feel like they're tacked on. Repetition is present but serves a purpose. I'd say a 3 or 4. Since the structure has some weaknesses but the overall argument is clear, maybe 3.5, but since we need integers, probably 3 or 4. Given that the main points are there but presented clumsily, maybe 3.

Analysis:  
**Fluency**: The text exhibits formal, archaic language with complex sentence structures, which, while grammatically correct, impede smooth readability. Long paragraphs and repetitive rhetorical flourishes disrupt flow, but no critical syntax/spelling errors were noted.  
**Coherence**: The narrative lacks clear transitions between sections (e.g., biblical analysis, geographic descriptions, rebuttals to critics). Ideas are logically sequenced to support the central claim but feel disjointed due to abrupt topic shifts and excessive repetition.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
