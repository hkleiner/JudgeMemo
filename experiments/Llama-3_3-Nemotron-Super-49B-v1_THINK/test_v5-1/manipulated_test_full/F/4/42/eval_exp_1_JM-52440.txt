Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria: Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is a theological treatise from the 19th century, I think. The language is formal, complex, with long sentences. I notice words like "whilst", "verily", "thou", which are archaic. Grammar and spelling seem correct for the period, but modern readers might find it challenging. The structure is logical with chapters and clear headings, but the sentences are dense and hard to follow without concentration. Fluency is about smooth reading. Despite correctness, the archaic style and complexity might hinder smoothness, so maybe a 3 or 4? 

Now Coherence. The structure is well-organized, moving from introduction to chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice. Each part connects logically, building an argument against the Real Presence doctrine. The author uses biblical references, church documents, and contrasts with Roman Catholic views. However, the text is very repetitive, especially in refuting opposing views. The author repeats points multiple times, which could make the narrative less efficient. Also, the emotional appeals and rhetorical questions (like "Oh! how I pity...") might disrupt the logical flow for some readers. Coherence is strong in structure but weakened by repetition and emotional inserts. Maybe a 4 because the overall argument is clear despite the repetition.

Wait, but the evaluation is based on the given metrics strictly. For Fluency, syntax, grammar, word choice. The text has no errors, but the style is outdated. Fluency is about how it reads. If the style is too archaic, it affects fluency. So maybe 3. Coherence: logical sequence, non-repetitive, clear progression. The repetition of refutations might count against coherence. So maybe 4 for coherence because the structure is clear, but repetition is an issue.

Finalizing: Fluency 3, Coherence 4.

Analysis: The text exhibits formal, archaic language with complex syntax and correct grammar, affecting modern fluency due to outdated phrasing. Coherence is maintained through logical structure and clear argument progression, though weakened by repetitive refutations and emotional appeals.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
