Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of this lengthy theological text. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a historical religious text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The author is arguing that the Church of England does not support the Real Presence doctrine.

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, etc. The text is formal, written in an archaic style (lots of "thou", "thee", outdated spellings like "verily", "whilst"). The sentences are long and complex, which might make readability difficult for modern readers. There are some typos ("Taughtvby" should be "Taught by", "ans" instead of "and", "vlindly" maybe "blindly"). These typos affect fluency slightly but might be transcription errors. The vocabulary is rich but sometimes redundant ("most precious body and blood" repeated). 

For coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter focuses on a point, citing Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies). The author uses transitions like "Thus far", "But", "Now" to connect ideas. However, the text is densely packed with theological arguments and assumes prior knowledge of the subject, which might confuse non-experts. There's a logical flow in refuting opposing views step by step, but the frequent quotes and references could disrupt the flow for some readers.

Specific issues: 
- Grammar/Punctuation: Typos like "Taughtvby", "ans" instead of "and".
- Syntax: Very long sentences, e.g., the first paragraph of Chapter I is a single sentence.
- Lexicon: Repetitive phrases, archaic language.
- Logic/Structure: While structured, the depth of theological detail might make it hard to follow without background.
- Transitions: Generally okay but could be smoother between some paragraphs.

Scoring Fluency: Despite the formality and length, the text is mostly clear if you're accustomed to older writing. Typos and complexity lower the score, but it's well-structured. Maybe a 4?

Coherence: The author's argument is well-organized, each chapter tackles a distinct aspect, and evidence is systematically presented. However, the density and assumed knowledge might reduce coherence for general readers. Score around 4 as well, but maybe 4.5 if expertise is considered.

Wait, the user's scale is 1-5. Let me adjust. Fluency: The archaic style and typos might make it a 4. Coherence: Very logical structure, clear progression, so 5? But the assumed knowledge and lengthy explanations could lower it to 4.5, but since scores are integers, maybe 4 for both? Or 4 and 5?

Wait, the user examples in the instructions had scores like 4 and 5. Let me check again. Fluency issues: typos (minor), complex sentences, archaic language. But overall, it's readable for its time. Maybe 4. Coherence is strong in structure and logic, so 5. But the density might affect coherence for some, so 4.5 isn't possible. So FINAL Coherence Score: 5, Fluency: 4.

But wait, the author sometimes uses very long paragraphs (e.g., the Homilies section is a big block), which affects readability. That's a structure issue under coherence. So maybe Coherence is 4 because of paragraph structure and assumed knowledge. Fluency also 4 due to style and typos.

Yes, I think both 4.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

**Issues and Comments:**  

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is heavily reliant on long, uninterrupted paragraphs (e.g., the Homily analysis in Chapter III), which disrupts readability and forces the reader to parse dense blocks of argumentation.  
   *Comment:* Modern formatting (e.g., paragraph breaks, headings) would enhance clarity.  

2. **[LEXICON]**: Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "verily," "whilst") and repetitive phrasing ("most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour") create barriers for contemporary readers.  
   *Comment:* While appropriate for historical context, it hampers fluency for non-specialists.  

3. **[GRAMMAR]**: Minor typos (e.g., "Taughtvby," "ans" instead of "and," "vlindly") and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing commas in lists).  
   *Comment:* These are likely transcription errors but still detract slightly.  

4. **[SYNTAX]**: Excessively long sentences (e.g., the opening
