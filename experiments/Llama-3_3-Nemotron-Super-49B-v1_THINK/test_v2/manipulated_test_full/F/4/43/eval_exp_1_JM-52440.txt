Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text's fluency and coherence, then score them. First, I need to read the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The author is arguing against the Real Presence and adoration/sacrifice, citing Church documents.

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, etc. The text is formal, with long sentences. That might make it less readable for some, but it's common in academic or theological writing. I need to check for grammar errors. Scanning through, I notice some complex sentences but no obvious grammatical mistakes. However, there are very long paragraphs, which can affect readability. For example, the first chapter has huge blocks of text without breaks, which might confuse readers. Also, some sentences are convoluted, like the part where the author discusses the Rubric in the Communion Service. The structure within paragraphs could be better; ideas sometimes feel densely packed without clear transitions. But overall, the language is precise, and terms are well-defined. So fluency might be high but deducted for paragraph structure and sentence length.

Coherence: This is about organization, logical flow, transitions. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author uses Church documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.) in a logical order. Each chapter builds on the previous, refuting opposing views step by step. Transitions between ideas are clear, like moving from Articles to Catechism to Homilies. However, the text assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and Church documents, which might confuse some readers. There's a consistent argument throughout, so coherence is strong. But the density of information and the lack of summaries or transitional phrases between some sections might slightly reduce coherence for less familiar readers.

Now, identifying specific issues. For fluency: [STRUCTURE] for long paragraphs, [SYNTAX] for complex sentences. For coherence: [CLARITY] due to assumed knowledge, [TRANSITION] in some section shifts. 

Scoring: Fluency might be 4 because while it's well-written, the structure and length hinder readability. Coherence is 5 because the argument is well-organized and logically flows, even if dense.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 5**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 4**

---

### **Issues and Comments**

#### **Fluency (4/5)**  
1. **[STRUCTURE]** Extremely long paragraphs (e.g., Chapter I) hinder readability. Modern writing typically favors shorter paragraphs for clarity.  
2. **[SYNTAX]** Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is.") may confuse readers due to poor phrasing or typos.  
3. **[LEXICON]** Formal, archaic tone (e.g., "verily," "whosoever") is consistent but may alienate non-specialist readers.  

#### **Coherence (5/5)**  
1. **[LOGIC]** Clear, stepwise refutation of opposing views using authoritative sources (Articles, Catechism, Homilies).  
2. **[STRUCTURE]** Chapters and subtopics logically progress from defining terms to addressing specific doctrines (Real Presence → Adoration → Sacrifice).  
3. **[CLARITY]** Assumes prior knowledge of theological terminology (e.g., "transubstantiation," "consubstantiation") without explanation, potentially excluding casual readers.  

#### **Noted Strengths**  
- **Coherence**: Rigorous use of Church documents to build a consistent argument.  
- **Fluency**: Precise vocabulary and consistent formal tone, despite complexity.  

#### **Noted Weaknesses**  
- **Fluency**: Poor paragraph pacing and archaic language reduce accessibility.  
- **Coherence**: No transitional summaries between chapters to aid less knowledgeable readers.

**Rationale for Scores**:  
- **Coherence (5)**: The text is meticulously organized, with each section logically addressing a facet of the doctrine. Transitions between ideas (e.g., from Articles to Catechism) are seamless.  
- **Fluency (4)**: While grammatically sound and rhetorically precise, the dense, antiquated style and lack of paragraph breaks impair readability for modern audiences.
