Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given story. First, I need to read through the text carefully. 

Starting with fluency: Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, etc. The story seems to have complex sentences, which might affect readability. For example, some sentences are long and packed with information. There are also archaic terms like "hap nab at a venture" which might confuse modern readers. I notice some commas missing or misplaced, like in "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction..."—the comma after "Dickens" might be needed for clarity. Also, words like "demned" should be "damned." 

Now coherence: Coherence is about organization and logical flow. The text jumps between discussing Dickens' writing style and then diving into a scene with Stransom and Creston. The transition between the introduction and the story setup feels abrupt. There's a lot of backstory dumped in the Dramatis Personae section without clear connections to the main plot points. Characters like Mr. Bud and Mr. Drood are introduced quickly, which might confuse readers. Also, the shift from the analytical part to the narrative (e.g., "ANDREW LANG." followed by "CHAPTER: THE STORY") is jarring. 

Looking at specific tags: Grammar issues like missing articles ("a young University man"), syntax issues with sentence structure ("He was to see “that” in real life."), lexicon problems with outdated terms, logic gaps in character motivations (e.g., Princess Puffer's hatred without explanation), structural issues in chapter transitions, clarity issues with vague references ("the auld mysterie"), and weak transitions between ideas (like from the preface to the analysis).

For fluency, despite some complexity, the text is mostly readable but has enough issues to lower the score. For coherence, the abrupt shifts and poor transitions make it harder to follow, so coherence might be lower.

Final scores: Fluency maybe 3 because while there are errors, it's still mostly understandable. Coherence 2 due to structural and transitional problems.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

**ISSUES AND COMMENTS**  

#### **COHERENCE (2)**  
- **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative abruptly shifts between literary criticism (e.g., discussing Dickens’ style) and fictional scenes (e.g., Stransom and Creston) without clear transitions, disrupting flow.  
- **[TRANSITION]** The leap from Andrew Lang’s preface to “CHAPTER: THE STORY” is jarring, with no bridge between the analytical introduction and the dramatis personae.  
- **[CLARITY]** Overloaded backstory in “DRAMATIS PERSONÆ” (e.g., Mr. Bud, Mr. Drood, and family ties) is dumped without integrating it logically into the unfolding plot.  
- **[LOGIC]** Motivations (e.g., Princess Puffer’s hatred for Jasper) and supernatural elements (e.g., Jasper’s visions) are introduced without clear explanation or connection to the main mystery.  

#### **FLUENCY (3)**  
- **[SYNTAX]** Overly complex, winding sentences (e.g., “He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins… careful study of character”) hinder readability.  
- **[GRAMMAR]** Missing articles (“a young University man”), archaic phrasing (“hap nab at a venture”), and typos (“demned” instead of “damned”).  
- **[LEXICON]** Outdated terms (“hap nab at a venture,” “the auld mysterie”) and redundant phrases (“the least of the innumerable attractions”).  
- **[CLARITY]** Vague references (e.g., “the auld mysterie”) assume prior knowledge of Dickensian scholarship.  
- **[SYNTAX]** Awkward sentence structure: “We did salute the happy morn” feels forced and disconnected from preceding sentences.  

The text struggles most with coherence due to disjointed structure and unclear connections between ideas, while fluency suffers from archaic language and sentence complexity but remains mostly intelligible.
