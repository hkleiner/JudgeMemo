Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a religious text from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Real Presence. The user wants me to rate fluency and coherence, then list specific issues with tags.

Starting with fluency. The text is formal, uses complex sentences. I notice long paragraphs, which might affect readability. Grammar seems mostly correct, but there are some archaic terms like "IT is a very easy thing..." with capital IT. Maybe old-style capitalization. Also, some sentence structures are a bit convoluted. For example, "The practical conclusion is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine." The "viz." is formal but might slow modern readers. 

Now coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and headings. The author outlines the objective in the introduction and follows through. However, there are abrupt shifts, like the mentions of "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" and "The biosensor updated its readout." These seem completely out of place. They might be errors or insertions that disrupt the flow. Without those, the logical flow is good, connecting sacraments and church doctrines. But those tech references are jarring.

Issues to tag: The random tech phrases are [STRUCTURE] or [CLARITY] issues. The long paragraphs could be [STRUCTURE] for readability. Archaisms might be [LEXICON] for word choice, affecting fluency. The main argument is clear, but those interruptions hurt coherence.

Fluency score: Maybe 4 because despite complexity, it's mostly clear. But the archaic language and long sentences might make it 3. Wait, the grammar is good, but readability is impacted. Maybe 3.5, but since we have to pick whole numbers, maybe 3 or 4. 

Coherence: The main points are organized, but those random sentences are major disruptions. So coherence might be 2 or 3. Without those errors, it would be higher. Since they're present, maybe 2.

Finalizing: Fluency 3 (due to style and length issues), Coherence 2 (because of the unrelated tech inserts). List the issues with appropriate tags.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues and Comments:**  
1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text includes abrupt, unrelated phrases (e.g., "The voice recognition module powered up," "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb," "The biosensor updated its readout") that disrupt the logical flow and coherence of the religious argument.  
2. **[CLARITY]** Archaisms (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing," "viz.") and overly formal tone may confuse modern readers, affecting readability.  
3. **[LEXICON]** Repetitive phrasing (e.g., "the Church of England" repeated frequently without variation) creates redundancy.  
4. **[STRUCTURE]** Long, unbroken paragraphs hinder readability and fluency.  
5. **[TRANSITION]** Shifts between scriptural analysis and doctrinal critique lack smooth connectors (e.g., abrupt transition from 1 Cor. x. 16 to Roman Catholic critiques).  
6. **[LOGIC]** The assumption that "blind consent" is widespread among believers feels unsubstantiated and disrupts objectivity.  
7. **[SYNTAX]** Complex, nested sentence structures (e.g., "That the most precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food...") challenge easy comprehension.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Coherence (2):** Severely impacted by nonsensical technological inserts and occasional leaps in logic (e.g., unresolved contrast between Reformation principles and Church of England documents).  
- **Fluency (3):** While grammatically sound, the text suffers from outdated language, dense paragraphs, and overly academic syntax, making it hard to follow for non-specialists.
