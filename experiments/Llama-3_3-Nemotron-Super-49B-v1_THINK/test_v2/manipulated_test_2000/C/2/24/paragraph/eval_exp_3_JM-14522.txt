Okay, let's start by reading the story carefully. It's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, but I notice there are some anachronistic elements like a hologram, Bluetooth signal, surveillance camera. Those must be intentional additions or edits for this task.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, word choice. The original story is known for its witty dialogue and smooth prose. But the inserted modern terms might disrupt fluency. For example, "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A bluetooth signal was detected" and "A surveillance camera moved slightly." These feel out of place in a 19th-century setting. They cause jarring moments, making the text less smooth. Also, check for grammar issues. The text seems mostly correct grammatically, but the sudden tech references are [LEXICON] issues because they're anachronistic and disrupt the period consistency.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about organization, logical flow, transitions. The story's structure is clear: introduction, setup, ghost encounters. However, the modern elements might disrupt the logical flow if they're not integrated. For example, the hologram and Bluetooth don't contribute to the plot and feel like random inserts. They might cause [CLARITY] or [STRUCTURE] issues if they confuse the reader about the time period. Also, check if ideas build upon each other. The story flows well otherwise, but these inserts are abrupt.

Now, specific issues:

1. Anachronistic terms (hologram, Bluetooth, surveillance camera) - [LEXICON] and maybe [CLARITY] because they confuse the setting.
2. These inserts disrupt the period feel, affecting fluency and coherence.
3. Grammar and syntax seem okay otherwise.
4. Transitions between paragraphs are good, but the tech terms are jarring transitions [TRANSITION].
5. The story's logic is sound except for these unrelated tech elements [LOGIC].

Rating Fluency: The original text is fluent, but the additions cause awkwardness. Maybe 4, but because of the jarring elements, drop to 3.

Coherence: The overall structure is coherent, but the inserts disrupt the setting's consistency. So maybe 4, but due to the inconsistencies, drop to 3.

Wait, but the task says to rate based on the given text, not comparing to the original. So even though the tech terms are odd, do they affect coherence and fluency within the text itself?

Fluency: The sentences are well-constructed, but the anachronisms make the word choice odd [LEXICON], affecting readability. So fluency score might be 3.

Coherence: The story's organization is good, but the random tech terms don't fit the narrative's time period, causing [CLARITY] and [STRUCTURE] issues. So coherence score 3.

But wait, the coherence is about idea connection, not historical accuracy. If the story internally is consistent despite the anachronisms, maybe coherence isn't too bad. However, the tech elements are unexplained and unrelated, so they might cause [LOGIC] gaps. For example, why is there a hologram? It's not integrated into the plot. So coherence score could be lower.

Alternatively, maybe the coherence is still good because the main plot flows well, and the tech bits are just minor distractions. But since they're not part of the plot, they might be considered [STRUCTURE] issues if they disrupt the narrative flow.

Hmm. Need to balance. The main story flows logically, but the inserts are jarring. So for coherence, maybe 4 if the inserts don't affect the logical flow of the ghost story, but 3 if they do. Since they're just mentioned briefly without impact, maybe coherence is 4, but fluency is 3 due to word choice issues.

Wait, the user's text includes these modern elements. So as an annotator, I have to evaluate based on the given text, not knowing it's a modified version. So the presence of "hologram", "bluetooth", "surveillance camera" are part of the text and affect fluency (word choice, consistency) and coherence (setting consistency).

Therefore, fluency issues: [LEXICON] for anachronistic terms. Clarity issues because the setting is confused [CLARITY].

Coherence issues: [STRUCTURE] if the setting is inconsistent, [LOGIC] if elements don't fit.

So final scores:

Fluency: 3 (due to jarring word choices)

Coherence: 3 (due to inconsistent setting elements disrupting the narrative's logical world)

But wait, the original story's coherence and fluency are high, but with these edits, they're lowered. So the final scores would reflect the modified text's issues.
