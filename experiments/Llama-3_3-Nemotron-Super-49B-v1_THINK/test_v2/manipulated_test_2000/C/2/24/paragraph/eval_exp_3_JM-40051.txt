Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully. The title is "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," and the author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, sentence structure, etc. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the style and language. The sentences are long and complex, which might make them hard to follow. There are some archaic terms and phrases like "antldiluvians" (probably antediluvians), "havilah," and "Bridtish possessions" (should be British). Also, there are typos: "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," "scientest" instead of "scientist," "commisitutes" maybe "constitutes"? Wait, in the text it's "consitutes" – that's a typo. 

Grammar and punctuation: Some sentences are very long and convoluted. For example, the paragraph starting "When God made man..." has multiple clauses without clear transitions. There's a mix of formal and informal tone, like using "I smiled" in a formal essay. Word choice is mostly formal but sometimes redundant, like repeating "beautiful" multiple times. 

Now coherence. The structure starts with the author's discovery, then biblical references, location description, and scenery. However, the transitions between ideas are weak. For example, jumping from discussing the Bible to the location on the Mississippi without a clear link. The author assumes the reader knows certain biblical references without explanation. There's a logical gap in assuming the described location matches the Garden of Eden just because of river names and geography. The text meanders, like the part about Trempealeau's town site and the story about Mr. Dovile killing snakes feels disconnected from the main point. 

Structural issues: The text blends personal anecdotes, biblical analysis, geographical description, and defensive remarks about criticism without a clear outline. The conclusion feels abrupt, just ending with a description without summarizing the claim. 

So for fluency, the main issues are syntax (long sentences), grammar typos, lexicon (archaic and redundant words), and clarity (ambiguous phrasing). For coherence, structure is an issue, transitions are weak, logic in connections is lacking, and some parts are unclear or redundant. 

Rating fluency: Maybe 3? Because while it's readable with effort, the errors and complexity drag it down. Coherence: 2? Because the structure is disjointed, transitions poor, and logical connections weak.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

---

**Issues and Comments:**  

- **[STRUCTURE]** The text lacks a clear organizational framework, blending biblical interpretation, personal anecdotes, geographical descriptions, and defensive remarks without logical progression.  
- **[TRANSITION]** Abrupt shifts occur between ideas (e.g., from biblical analysis to the Mississippi location, or from geography to snake anecdotes).  
- **[LOGIC]** Assumptions (e.g., equating the Mississippi with the Euphrates, or linking rattlesnakes to the "Serpent") are unsupported by coherent reasoning.  
- **[CLARITY]** Overly complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "When God made man...") and vague terms (e.g., "antldiluvians," "Havilah") obscure meaning.  
- **[GRAMMAR/SYNTAX]** Errors include typos ("admirirg," "dimentions," "scientest"), outdated phrasing, and excessively long sentences.  
- **[LEXICON]** Redundant adjectives ("beautiful," "most beautiful") and anachronistic tone (formal vs. casual phrases like "I smiled").  
- **[COHERENCE]** Ideas fail to build logically (e.g., the Tangent about Trempealeau’s town site disrupts focus on Eden’s location).  

The **coherence** score suffers most from disjointed structure and weak logical connections, while **fluency** is hindered by archaic style and grammatical errors, though the text remains decipherable with effort.
