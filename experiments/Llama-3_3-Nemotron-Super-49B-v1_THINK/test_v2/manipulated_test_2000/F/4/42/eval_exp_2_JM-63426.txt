Okay, let me start by carefully reading through both chapters of the story provided. The first chapter is an introduction to Will Bradley, discussing his impact on American graphic arts, while the second chapter narrates his early life in Ishpeming.

Starting with Fluency. The text has some grammatical errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "It should be talked about." There are also subject-verb agreement issues like "the employees are all natives" and "the work is do by hand." Punctuation seems mostly okay, but some sentences are long and a bit convoluted, affecting readability. Word choice is generally good, but there's some redundancy, like repeated mentions of Bradley's American influence without varying the phrasing.

Now for Coherence. The introduction jumps between Bradley's work and historical context without smooth transitions. The shift from discussing European artists to Bradley's impact feels abrupt. In "The Boy Printer," the narrative is mostly linear but includes some tangents, like the circus day, that don't fully integrate into the main storyline. There's a clear structure in each chapter, but within paragraphs, ideas sometimes feel loosely connected. For example, the part about the faker selling soap interrupts the flow of Will's job progression.

Specific issues tagged: GRAMMAR for "shoulded," SYNTAX in sentence structure, LEXICON for redundancy, LOGIC in transitions, STRUCTURE for paragraph organization, CLARITY in vague phrases, TRANSITION between paragraphs.

Fluency score: Considering the errors and some clumsiness, but overall understandable. Maybe 3.

Coherence score: The structure is there, but transitions and some logical connections are weak. Maybe 3 as well, but need to check again.

Wait, coherence might be a bit higher because each chapter has a clear theme, even if transitions within are rough. Maybe 4 for coherence? But the abrupt shifts in the introduction might bring it down. Hmm. Let me balance. Fluency 3, Coherence 3 or 4. Need to decide based on definitions.

### **Key Issues and Comments**  

#### **Coherence (3/5)**  
- **[STRUCTURE]**: The introduction and "The Boy Printer" chapter are thematically distinct but lack a clear thematic bridge. The abrupt shift from Bradley’s artistic legacy to his childhood feels disconnected.  
- **[TRANSITION]**: Historical references (e.g., Morris, Beardsley) in the introduction are dropped without explicit ties to Bradley’s work.  
- **[LOGIC]**: The futility of the "faker" anecdote in "The Boy Printer" disrupts the narrative flow of Will’s apprenticeship.  

#### **Fluency (3/5)**  
- **[GRAMMAR]**: Errors like “It shoulded be talked about,” “the work is do by hand,” and inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., “was” instead of “were”).  
- **[SYNTAX]**: Awkward phrasing (e.g., “when you was hungry,” “you are now a worked man”).  
- **[LEXICON]**: Redundant praise for Bradley’s “American” style without nuanced elaboration.  
- **[CLARITY]**: Vague descriptions (e.g., “the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life”).  

The text is generally understandable but suffers from grammatical inconsistencies, awkward phrasing, and organizational gaps that detract from smooth reading. Coherence is compromised by abrupt thematic shifts and unresolved tangents, though each chapter maintains internal logic.
