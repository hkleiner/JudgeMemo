Okay, let's tackle this annotation task. The user wants me to evaluate the story's fluency and coherence, then give scores with specific tags for issues.

First, I need to read the story carefully. It's "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I know it's a classic, so the writing is probably good, but I have to check for any modern issues or possible errors in the provided text.

Fluency involves clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. Coherence is about organization, logical flow, transitions, and consistency.

Starting with fluency: The text uses complex sentences, which is typical for Wilde's style. There are long paragraphs, especially in Chapter I. For example, the first paragraph is quite long without a break. That might affect readability, but since it's a classic, maybe it's intentional. However, modern readers might find it less fluent. Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, like Lord Canterville's dialogue about the ghost. That could make readability lower. 

Grammar and punctuation seem correct. Word choice is rich and appropriate, with terms like "punctilious honour," "receptive expectations," which add to the Victorian tone. No obvious LEXICON issues, but some words might be less common today (e.g., "spry," "guys" as ropes? Wait, "gyves" are shackles, so that's correct). 

Coherence: The story is well-structured. Each chapter has a clear purpose. Chapter I introduces the setting and characters, Chapter II the ghost's appearance. Transitions between scenes are smooth, like moving from the purchase to the family's arrival. However, there's a jump from the family discussing everyday topics to the ghost appearing without buildup, but that's intentional for humor. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistently woven through. 

Possible issues: In Chapter II, the transition from breakfast conversation to the ghost at night feels a bit abrupt, but it's meant to be surprising. Also, some character introductions, like the twins being called "The Star and Stripes," might be a bit sudden without more context, but it's a minor point.

Now, specific issues to tag:

For Fluency:
- [STRUCTURE] Long paragraphs in Chapter I might reduce readability.
- [SYNTAX] Some very long, complex sentences (e.g., Lord Canterville's first speech).
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms (e.g., "guys" if misinterpreted, but "gyves" is correct).
- [CLARITY] A few phrases could be ambiguous, like "receptive expectations" without context.

For Coherence:
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from dinner talk to the ghost's appearance.
- [STRUCTURE] Chapter II's events follow logically, but the ghost's introduction is abrupt for effect.

Scores: Fluency might be 4 due to some readability issues from sentence length and paragraphs. Coherence is 5 because the structure and flow are strong despite intentional abruptness for humor.

Wait, but the text is a classic, so maybe the long paragraphs and complex sentences are acceptable for its time. However, the task is to rate based on modern readability expectations? The instructions don't specify, but since it's about quality in general, maybe the fluent score is higher. But the user might expect considering contemporary fluency standards. Hmm.

Alternatively, given that it's well-written with proper grammar and engaging despite complexity, Fluency could be 5. Coherence is definitely 5. But need to check if there are any actual errors.

Wait, checking the text again: Are there any grammar errors? The provided text seems correct. So Fluency issues are more about style than errors. So maybe Fluency is 5, Coherence 5. But the user might expect some deductions for lengthy sentences. Let me think.

The definitions say Fluency includes "sentences should be logically connected and easy to follow." Some sentences are hard to follow due to length. For example, the first paragraph in Chapter I has multiple clauses. So maybe Fluency is 4. Coherence is 5 because the overall structure is excellent.

So final scores: Coherence 5, Fluency 4.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

**Issues and Comments:**  

- **[STRUCTURE/FLUENCY]**: Chapter I features exceptionally long paragraphs (e.g., Lord Canterville’s dialogue and the family description) that may impede modern readability due to lack of line breaks, though this aligns with 19th-century writing conventions.  
- **[SYNTAX/FLUENCY]**: Several sentences (e.g., Lord Canterville’s explanation of the ghost, Washington’s letter plans) are overly complex with nested clauses, potentially hindering smooth flow.  
- **[LEXICON/FLUENCY]**: Archaic terms
