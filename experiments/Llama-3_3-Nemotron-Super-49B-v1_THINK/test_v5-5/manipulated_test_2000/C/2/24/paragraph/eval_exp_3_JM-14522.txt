Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using the given criteria. First, I need to read the story carefully and identify any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The story seems mostly well-written, but there are some anachronisms. For example, mentions of a "hologram displayed the weather," "bluetooth signal was detected," and "surveillance camera moved slightly." These modern tech references in a 19th-century setting might disrupt the flow. Also, the style is mostly Victorian, but these terms stick out. That's a LEXICON issue because the word choice is inconsistent with the time period.

Next, Coherence. The narrative generally follows a logical sequence, but the introduction of modern elements like Bluetooth and holograms feels abrupt. These aren't explained and clash with the historical context, causing slight confusion. However, the main plot about the ghost and the family's interactions is coherent. So maybe a minor STRUCTURE issue due to these jarring elements, but overall coherence is maintained.

For Fluency, despite the anachronisms, the grammar and syntax are good. The anachronisms are more about word choice than grammar, so LEXICON under Fluency. Since these are noticeable but don't hinder understanding too much, maybe a score of 4 for Fluency (some minor non-fluent parts).

Coherence score: The story holds together, but those modern elements cause minor disconnects. So a 4 for Coherence as well, since the main structure is sound but with minor issues.

Wait, but the criteria for Coherence 4 says "only some minor disconnected parts." The anachronisms might be considered minor, so yes, 4. Fluency 4 because the errors (LEXICON) are minor and don't affect flow much.

So final answer: Issues with LEXICON (anachronistic terms) and maybe STRUCTURE (minor coherence hit). Scores 4 and 4.
</think>

Issues: [LEXICON] Anachronistic terms (e.g., "hologram", "bluetooth signal", "surveillance camera") disrupt the Victorian-era setting; [STRUCTURE] Minor coherence disruption from unexplained modern elements.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
