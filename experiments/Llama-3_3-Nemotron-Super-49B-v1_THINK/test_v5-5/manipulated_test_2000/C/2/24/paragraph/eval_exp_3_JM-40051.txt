Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. 

Starting with fluency. The text is quite old-fashioned, with phrases like "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead'" which might affect readability. There are some long, convoluted sentences that could hinder flow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man..." is really long and has multiple clauses. Also, there are possible typos like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring). The author uses archaic language and repetitive structures, like starting sentences with "Our garden is again right." These contribute to minor fluency issues but not major errors. So maybe a Fluency score of 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor flaws.

Now for coherence. The story jumps between biblical references, the author's discovery, and descriptions of the location. There's a clear structure: introduction, biblical context, description of the garden's location, and then detailed geography. However, transitions between these sections could be smoother. The part about the hanging garden and the mention of rattlesnakes feel a bit abrupt. The author assumes the reader knows certain biblical details without much explanation. Also, the conclusion feels a bit rushed. Despite this, the overall narrative is followable, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnected parts but generally coherent.
