Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues related to Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Looking at the text, there are some complex sentences, but they seem mostly grammatically correct. However, there are a few spots where the wording feels a bit awkward. For example, in the Introduction chapter, the sentence "Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_." That part is really confusing. It looks like there might be a typo or misplaced words. "Road" probably should be "read" or something else. Also, phrases like "the first sprightly runnings" might be intentional archaic language, but could cause slight confusion. 

Another point: in the Dramatis Personæ section, there's a sentence: "This sixteen, hag determined, we learn hard," which seems fragmented. Maybe a typo or missing words. Also, "that is ever since John Jasper’s birth" implies the Princess Puffer has been disreputable for 26 years if Jasper is 26, but the math checks out if she started at his birth. Wait, the text says she's been dealing in opium for ten years and was a drunkard before that. If Jasper is 26, and she started opium 10 years ago, then she was a drunkard for 16 years before that. But the text says "twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper’s birth." That contradicts because 10 + 16 = 26, but the statement says she's been disreputable since his birth, which would be 26 years. So maybe the numbers are inconsistent here. That's a logic issue under Coherence.

For Coherence, the story seems to have a clear structure with chapters and character introductions. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from discussing Dickens's health to introducing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" feels a bit sudden. Also, in the OPENING OF THE TALE section, the introduction of the opium den and then jumping to Cloisterham without clear transitions might confuse readers. The character motivations, like Jasper's love for Rosa and his opium use, are somewhat clear but could be more smoothly integrated. The part where the author discusses other critics (Mr. Proctor, Mr. Walters) and their theories interrupts the narrative flow, making it less cohesive.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite some awkward phrasing and possible typos, the text is mostly readable. The errors are minor but noticeable. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has some non-fluent parts. 

For Coherence, the structure is there, but there are some disconnected parts and abrupt shifts. The inclusion of the author's own theories and references to other works (like "The Signalman") might disrupt the flow for some readers. However, the overall context is understandable. So Coherence might be a 3, as it's coherent in general but has obvious issues.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Confusing sentence structure in "Except _of rivals_..." with possible typos; [SYNTAX] Fragmented phrase "This sixteen, hag determined, we learn hard"; [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline for Princess Puffer's disreputable years vs. Jasper's age; [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts (e.g., Dickens’s health to *Edwin Drood* introduction); [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences (e.g., character relationships in *Dramatis Personæ*); [STRUCTURE] Interruptive discussions of external critiques/theories.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
