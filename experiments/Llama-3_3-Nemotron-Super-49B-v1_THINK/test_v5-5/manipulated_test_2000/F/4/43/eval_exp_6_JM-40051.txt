Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues in each category.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older time, maybe 19th century, so the language is formal and somewhat archaic. That's okay, but I need to check for grammatical errors, syntax issues, etc. Looking through, there are some long, complex sentences which might affect flow. For example, the sentence starting "When God made man..." is quite long and has multiple clauses. There's also a part with "Nineteen been at lost a..." which seems garbledâ€”maybe a typo or scanning error. Spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (should be antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring) are present. However, overall, the text is mostly readable despite some awkward phrasing and outdated vocabulary. So Fluency might be a 3 because there are noticeable errors but the text is generally understandable.

Now Coherence. The story has a clear structure: introduction of the discovery, biblical references, location description, and features of the Garden. However, there are abrupt jumps, like the sudden mention of "Nineteen been at lost..." which disrupts the flow. The author switches between describing the landscape, biblical connections, and personal anecdotes without smooth transitions. Some parts feel repetitive, like emphasizing the beauty and the rivers multiple times. The logic connecting the Garden's features to the biblical description is sometimes stretched (e.g., associating the Mississippi with the Euphrates). Despite this, the overall narrative is followable with some effort. So Coherence might be a 3 as well because while there's a general coherence, there are significant clarity issues and abrupt shifts.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "Nineteen been at lost a..."), [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures, [SPELLING] Typos ("dimentions"), [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary, [LOGIC] Forced biblical connections, [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., "Nineteen..."), [CLARITY] Repetitive descriptions, [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between ideas.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
