Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate a given story based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to identify the issues in the text under each category and then assign scores.

Looking at the story provided, it's a theological text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The structure is formal with chapters and references to religious documents like Articles and the Catechism.

Starting with Fluency: The text is mostly well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. However, there are several typos scattered throughout, like "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "ifmthey", "srrvice", "businessbis", "tue", "prssent", "wnd", "invisibly bestows the invisible gift on tye soul" (should be "they"), and "kt" instead of "It". These are minor but noticeable. The syntax is generally good, but some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. Word choice is formal and appropriate. So, for Fluency, despite the typos and long sentences, the text is mostly fluent. Maybe a 4 because the errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much.

Now Coherence: The text is well-structured with a clear introduction stating the objective, and it progresses logically through chapters. The author sets up the controversy, references Scripture and Church documents, and outlines the points of debate. Transitions between ideas are smooth, and the use of headings (CHAPTER) helps. However, the dense theological content might make it hard for non-experts to follow, but within its context, it's coherent. There's no apparent disjointedness or logical gaps. So Coherence would likely be a 5 since it's well-organized and each part connects to the next without issues.

Wait, but the user mentioned "Evaluation Form" with specific metrics. Let me double-check. For Coherence, Score 5 means entirely coherent, well-structured. The text does that. For Fluency, despite the typos, they are minor and don't affect the flow much, so Score 4.

So the issues for Fluency would be [SPELLING] and [SYNTAX] for the long sentences. For Coherence, maybe none, but if any, perhaps [CLARITY] due to complexity, but since it's targeted at a specific audience, maybe not. The instructions say to list issues that lead to point deduction. Since Coherence is perfect, no issues there. Fluency has spelling errors and somewhat complex syntax.

Finalizing: Issues under Fluency with spelling and syntax. Coherence has no issues. Scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 5.

Issues: [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "ifmthey", "srrvice", "businessbis", "tue", "prssent", "wnd", "tye"). [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
