Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency using the given criteria. First, I need to read the story carefully and identify any issues. 

Starting with fluency. The story is mostly well-written, but there are typos. For example, "seej" should be "seen", "wdll" as "will", "ofteb" as "often", "xnd" instead of "and", "vety" maybe "very", "teuey" as "they", "fsw" as "few", "freedom" possibly a typo for "fearless" or similar, "Srripes" should be "Stripes", "delicate withvthe" missing space, "n" instead of "and", "guarfians" as "guardians", "akl" as "all", "nonsensd" as "nonsense", "Myerw" as "Myers", "librwry" as "library", "evwrything" as "everything", "anmold" as "old", "obpong" maybe "small", "Unoted" as "United". These are scattered throughout. However, despite these typos, the text is still mostly readable. The sentences flow well, grammar is generally correct except for the typos. So fluency score: since there are multiple minor errors but the flow isn't hindered much, maybe a 4? But wait, the criteria for 4 says "minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors with no effect." The typos here are numerous but not obstructing understanding. So maybe 4.

For coherence, the story is well-structured. It starts with the purchase, introduces the family, the ghost legend, then the events in the house. Each chapter connects logically. The transition from Chapter I to II is smooth. The ghost's appearance and the family's reactions are coherent. However, there's a part where after the ghost appears, the twins throw a pillow. That seems a bit abrupt. Also, Mrs. Umney's warning and the family's dismissal might feel a bit rushed, but overall the narrative progresses logically. Maybe a minor disconnect there, but not major. So coherence score 5 because it's entirely coherent with minor possible issues that don't affect overall structure.

Wait, but the twins' action with the pillow comes out of nowhere. Is that a coherence issue? It's a bit sudden, but in the context of the story's humor, it might be intentional. The story is a parody, so maybe that's acceptable. So maybe coherence is still 5. But if there's an abrupt shift without transition, that could be a score 4. Hmm. The rest of the story is well-connected, so perhaps just a minor issue, so coherence 5.

So final scores: Fluency 4 (multiple typos but fluent overall), Coherence 5 (well-structured with minor possible abruptness but not impactful).

Issues: [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "ofteb", "xnd", "vety", "teuey", "fsw", "freedom", "Srripes", "withvthe", "n", "guarfians", "akl", "nonsensd", "Myerw", "librwry", "evwrything", "anmold", "obpong", "Unoted"), [LEXICON] occasional unclear word choices (e.g., "freedom" in context).  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
