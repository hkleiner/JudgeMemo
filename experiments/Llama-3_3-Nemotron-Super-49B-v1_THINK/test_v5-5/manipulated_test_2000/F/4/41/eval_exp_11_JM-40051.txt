Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is old-fashioned, with archaic language and spelling (like "antldiluvians", "princopak", "loh"), which might be intentional for the period but still affects readability. There are grammatical errors, such as missing articles ("a garden of Eden" should be "the garden"), inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "has been opening" to "was ignorant"), and punctuation issues (long sentences without clear breaks). Word choice is sometimes awkward, like "sensibly impressed" instead of "strongly impressed". Despite these, the text is mostly understandable, so Fluency score might be 3.

For Coherence, the structure is a bit disjointed. The author jumps between biblical references, personal discovery, and geographical descriptions without smooth transitions. There's repetition, like mentioning the location multiple times. However, the overall narrative about identifying the Garden of Eden has a clear progression, even if it's meandering. Some parts feel abrupt, like shifting from scientific arguments to describing the town's history. But the main idea holds, so Coherence might be a 4.

Wait, but the structure has some issues. The author switches topics abruptly, and there are sections that seem out of place. However, the core argument is logically sequenced. Maybe Coherence is 3? No, because despite some shifts, the overall flow from introduction to explanation to conclusion is there. So maybe 4. Fluency has more noticeable errors but still manageable, so 3.

Finalizing: Fluency 3, Coherence 4.

Issues: [SPELLING] (archaic/misspelled words: "antldiluvians", "princopak", "loh"), [GRAMMAR] (inconsistent verb tenses, missing articles), [SYNTAX] (overly complex sentences), [LEXICON] (awkward phrasing: "sensibly impressed"), [STRUCTURE] (disjointed transitions between topics), [CLARITY] (repetitive explanations), [TRANSITION] (abrupt shifts in focus).

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
