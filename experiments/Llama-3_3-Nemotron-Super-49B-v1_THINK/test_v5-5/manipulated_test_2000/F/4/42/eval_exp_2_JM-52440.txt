Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The text is formal and old-fashioned, which might affect fluency.

Starting with fluency. The text has some grammatical errors. For example, "was" instead of "were" in several places, like "a blind consent is blindly give" should be "given". There are also subject-verb agreements issues, such as "those who was loyal" should be "were". Some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might hinder smooth reading. However, the vocabulary is rich and appropriate, so lexicon is good. Despite the errors, the text is mostly understandable, so fluency isn't terrible. Maybe a 3 or 4? Let's see the criteria. Score 3 is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." The errors here are noticeable but don't completely block understanding. So Fluency Score: 3.

Now coherence. The structure is clear: Introduction and Chapter I, each with a logical flow. The author sets up a topic, discusses opposing views, and then examines Church documents. Transitions between ideas are generally smooth. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like when the author mentions the Church's current state without clear connection. Also, some paragraphs are quite long without clear segmentation, which might cause slight confusion. But overall, the narrative builds coherently. Score 4 for coherence because there are minor disconnected parts but overall it's well-structured. 

Issues to list: Grammar errors (subject-verb, tense), some awkward phrasing, and minor structural jumps. Labels would be [GRAMMAR], [SYNTAX], [STRUCTURE].
</think>

Issues: [GRAMMAR] - Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were"), tense inconsistencies, and incorrect verb forms (e.g., "give" instead of "given"). [SYNTAX] - Awkward phrasing in long, convoluted sentences. [STRUCTURE] - Minor abrupt transitions (e.g., shift to the Churchâ€™s contemporary state without clear connection).  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
