Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read the story carefully and then evaluate both Coherence and Fluency based on the given criteria.

Starting with Coherence. The story is divided into two chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to Will Bradley, discussing his impact on American graphic arts. The second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," seems to be a biographical account of Bradley's early life. 

Wait, the transition between the two chapters might be an issue. The first part talks about Bradley's professional achievements, and the second jumps to his childhood without a clear link. The reader might feel a disconnect because there's no transitional phrase or sentence connecting the adult accomplishments to the childhood story. That's a coherence problem under STRUCTURE or TRANSITION.

Also, in the second chapter, there are a lot of specific details about his childhood—moving to Ishpeming, working at the newspaper, interactions with his family. These events are presented in a somewhat fragmented way. For example, the switch from playing at the beach to going to school, then dealing with a stepfather, and starting work. Each scene is vivid but not clearly connected in a narrative flow. This could affect coherence, maybe under CLARITY or STRUCTURE.

Now, Fluency. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax. In the first chapter, there are a few errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "It should be talked about." "realized" instead of "realize"? Wait, "hard to realized" is incorrect; it should be "hard to realize." Also, "demolish" should be "demolished." 

In the second chapter, more errors: "was know" instead of "were known," "use to stamp" should be "used to stamp," "was thrilled" instead of "was thrilled" (but the text says "thrill him to spoke"—maybe "thrilled him to speak"?), "don’t worked" should be "didn’t work." There's also inconsistent verb tense usage, like "you was" instead of "you were" repeatedly. These are clear GRAMMAR and SPELLING issues.

Despite the errors, the text is mostly understandable. The fluency is hindered by these mistakes but not completely broken. So Fluency might be a 3 because there are obvious errors affecting flow but the text is still generally fluent.

For Coherence, even though there's a structural jump between chapters and some disjointed scenes in chapter 2, the overall narrative within each chapter is clear. The lack of transition between chapters is a major issue, but the rest holds somewhat. So maybe Coherence is a 3 as well because there are obvious issues but the story is mostly followable.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without narrative connection; [CLARITY] Fragmented scene presentation in Chapter 2; [GRAMMAR] Repeated subject-verb errors (e.g., "was know", "you was"); [SPELLING] "shoulded", "demolish"; [SYNTAX] Tense inconsistencies  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
