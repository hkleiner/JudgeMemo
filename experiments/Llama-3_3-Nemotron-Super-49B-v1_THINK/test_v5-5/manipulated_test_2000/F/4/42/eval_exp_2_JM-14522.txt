Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency, using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and note any issues.

Starting with fluency. The story is mostly well-written, but there are several grammatical errors. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." Also, "when they come to discuss terms" should be "when they came." There are verb tense inconsistencies, like "had been spilt" and "was removed" in the same context. Word choice issues too, such as "am see" instead of "has been seen." Punctuation might be missing in some places, like commas for clarity. Despite these, the overall flow is understandable, so maybe a 4 for fluency? Wait, the criteria say score 4 is only minor issues with no effect. But these errors do hinder a bit. Maybe 3? Because there are obvious errors affecting flow.

For coherence, the story structure is logical. It moves from introduction to the ghost's appearance smoothly. However, there's a jump from Chapter I to II without much transition. Also, some parts feel a bit abrupt, like the transition from the family's conversation to the ghost's appearance. The characters' reactions are consistent, though. The plot points connect, so coherence is generally good but with minor disconnects. Score 4 for coherence since the main structure is clear, just some minor issues.

Wait, the user provided a specific story, which is actually an adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost." The errors here are likely intentional for the task, not the original. But as an annotator, I have to judge based on the given text. So the issues are real in this version.

Fluency issues: Many grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, wrong verb forms). For example, "had been spilt" and "was removed" mix past perfect and simple past. "The twins, who am usually called" should be "were." "Washington Otis... had qualified himself by led the German" â€“ should be "by leading." These are numerous but not crippling. So Fluency score 3.

Coherence: The narrative flows logically, each chapter builds on the previous. The only issue is the abrupt start of Chapter II without a clear transition, and maybe the sudden appearance of the twins' description without integration. But overall, easy to follow. So Coherence score 4.

Finalizing: Issues listed under [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX]. Scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 3.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Multiple verb tense inconsistencies (e.g., "had been spilt" and "was removed"), incorrect verb forms (e.g., "am see", "had regretted"), and subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the twins... am"). [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "we'dded", "woedn't"). [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "we have really everything in common... except language"). [CLARITY] Brief ambiguities in sentence structure (e.g., "it may had resisted").  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
