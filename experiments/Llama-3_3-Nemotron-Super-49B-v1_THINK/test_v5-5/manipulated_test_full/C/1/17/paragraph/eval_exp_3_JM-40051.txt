Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll have to skim and note key points.

Starting with Coherence. The story seems to be about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions. But the structure is a bit all over the place. There are abrupt jumps between different topics—like switching from describing the garden to talking about a character's past (George Stransom) that doesn't seem connected. Also, there are random sentences like the one about killing the landlord and the motor car, which don't fit at all. These disrupt the flow and make the narrative disjointed.

For Fluency, checking grammar, syntax, etc. The text has some archaic language ("thou", "thee") which might be intentional for style, but there are clear errors. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" for "dimensions". Also, inconsistent punctuation and long, convoluted sentences that are hard to follow. Some sentences are fragmented or lack clear structure.

Now, categorizing the issues. For Coherence, the main problems are abrupt shifts (LOGIC), poor structure (STRUCTURE), and unclear connections between ideas (CLARITY). For Fluency, grammar errors (GRAMMAR), spelling mistakes (SPELLING), and awkward syntax (SYNTAX).

Scoring: Coherence is probably a 2 because while there's a central idea, the execution is very disjointed with many unrelated sections. Fluency might be a 3 since there are noticeable errors but the text is mostly understandable with effort.

Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt, unrelated narrative shifts (e.g., George Stransom’s backstory, random violence scene).
- [STRUCTURE] Poorly organized, lacks cohesive progression.
- [CLARITY] Ideas and connections between biblical references and geography are unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] Frequent errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions").
- [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "admirirg").
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, fragmented sentences.
- [TRANSITION] No logical flow between paragraphs.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
