Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate a story based on coherence and fluency, using specific criteria. The story is quite long, so I need to read through it carefully.

First, I'll tackle coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows, if ideas are connected logically, and if there's a clear structure. The story seems to be about the author claiming a specific location in the Midwest as the Garden of Eden. They use biblical references and geographical descriptions. 

Looking at the structure, the text jumps between different topics: biblical analysis, geographical descriptions, personal anecdotes, and even some geological discussions. There's a lot of repetition, especially the repeated invitations to "come and see." The author also compares their location to other places like Palestine and mentions various rivers and landmarks. 

I notice some abrupt shifts. For example, the text moves from describing the garden's beauty to discussing cyclones and then suddenly talks about a lawyer's comment about the devil. These transitions feel disconnected. There are also inconsistencies, like the claim that the area is exempt from cyclones but then mentions that storms pass around it, which might not fully align.

Now, for fluency. Fluency involves grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might be intentional given the biblical theme. However, there are noticeable errors. For instance, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians," and "admirirg" is a typo for "admiring." There's also inconsistent capitalization, like "THE AUTHOR" in all caps. 

The sentence structure is often complex and long, which can make it hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God formed the earth..." is very long and convoluted. There's also some awkward phrasing, such as "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat." The word choice sometimes feels overly elaborate or outdated, like "veritable" and "beau ideal," which might disrupt the flow for modern readers.

Considering the criteria, for coherence, the story has some logical connections but many abrupt shifts and repetitions. It's mostly understandable but requires effort due to the disorganization. So a score of 3 seems right because it's coherent generally but with obvious issues.

For fluency, despite the archaic style, there are clear grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The text is mostly fluent but with noticeable errors hindering the flow. So a score of 3 here as well because it's fluent in general with some obvious errors.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] - Frequent abrupt topic shifts (e.g., cyclones, devil references, geological age). [REPETITION] - Repeated "come and see" appeals and defensive justifications. [LOGIC] - Inconsistent claims (e.g., cyclone exemption vs. storm behavior). [TRANSITION] - Poor connections between biblical analysis, geography, and personal anecdotes. [CLARITY] - Overly complex, repetitive descriptions of scenery. [LEXICON] - Archaic vocabulary ("veritable," "beau ideal") and inconsistent tone. [SYNTAX] - Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., chronological time explanation). [SPELLING/Grammar] - Minor errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg").

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
