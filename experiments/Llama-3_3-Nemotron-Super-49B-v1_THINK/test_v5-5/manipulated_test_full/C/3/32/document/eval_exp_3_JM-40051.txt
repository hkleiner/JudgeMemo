Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll have to skim through parts but note any issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is from the 19th century, I think, given the style and references (like 1884, 1885). The language is formal and somewhat archaic. There are long, convoluted sentences which might affect readability. For example, sentences with multiple clauses without clear punctuation. I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice.

Looking for grammar issues: The text uses phrases like "a thing" repeatedly, which seems like placeholders or missing words. That's definitely a problem—maybe the original had blanks that weren't filled. Also, "antldiluvians" should be "antideluvians" (typo). There are some missing articles ("a stuff river") which disrupts fluency. 

Spelling mistakes: "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "diminensions" should be "dimensions", "utilirg" maybe "utilizing"? Wait, in the text, it's "utilirg" – that's a typo. Also, "auther" instead of "author" at the end. These are clear spelling errors.

Syntax: Some sentences are structured awkwardly. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after He might not be necessary, but it's not a major error. More problematic are sentences that are too long and hard to follow, like the one starting "The scenery just outlined..." which goes on for multiple clauses without clear breaks.

Lexicon: Word choice is mostly appropriate for the era, but some words feel outdated. However, the main issue is the repeated use of "a thing" which is unclear and disrupts understanding.

Now coherence. The story is arguing that a specific location (near the Mississippi, between Wisconsin and Minnesota) is the Garden of Eden. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions. 

Structure: The text jumps between describing the location, biblical interpretations, responses to critics, and invitations to visit. It's somewhat disjointed, with multiple sections that feel like separate essays. Transitions between ideas are poor; for example, moving from describing the garden's features to discussing Dr. Warren's critique without a clear link.

Logic: The author assumes the Garden must have certain features based on the Bible and then fits the described location to those assumptions. While the reasoning is presented confidently, it's circular and lacks objective evidence. There's repetition in emphasizing the garden's beauty and uniqueness without varied supporting points.

Clarity: Many parts are unclear due to the "a thing" placeholders, long sentences, and assumed knowledge (e.g., references to specific locations or people like Dr. Warren without explanation). The constant invocation of "you" to imagine the scene might engage the reader but also feels repetitive.

For coherence score, the main issues are disjointed structure, lack of clear transitions, and some logical leaps. But the overall narrative has a central claim, even if poorly supported. 

Fluency score is affected by numerous typos, awkward sentence structures, and the distracting "a thing" errors. Despite the formal tone, the errors and placeholders make it hard to follow at times.

So, for Fluency: The text has major grammatical errors (typos, missing words), some syntactic issues, but the overall flow is hindered significantly. Maybe a 2? Because there are fluent segments, but the errors are frequent.

Coherence: The structure is disjointed, transitions are poor, and there's repetition. However, the central argument is somewhat maintained throughout. Maybe a 3, since it's coherent in general but with obvious issues.

Wait, the criteria for Coherence 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity." That fits. Fluency 2: "Major grammatical errors... but some fluent segments."

So final scores: Coherence 3, Fluency 2.

Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "utilirg," "auther").
- [SPELLING] Repeated missing/incomplete terms ("a thing," "stuff").
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, poorly punctuated sentences.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and unclear placeholders.
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning and unproven assumptions.
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sections with poor transitions.
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "Dr. Warren," "Bishop Foss").
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., biblical critique to tourism invites).

FINAL Coherence Score: **
