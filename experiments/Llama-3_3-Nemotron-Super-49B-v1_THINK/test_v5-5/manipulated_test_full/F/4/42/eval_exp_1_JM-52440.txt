Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The author analyzes various church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies to argue against the Real Presence doctrine.

Starting with Fluency: The text is formal, written in an antiquated style with complex sentences. There are some archaic terms and structures ("whomsoever", "was" instead of "were" in a few places). For example, "we was taught by our Lord Himself" should be "we were taught". Also, "the body and blood of our blessed Saviour are in the bread and in the wine" uses "are" which might be a typo for "is" if referring to Christ. However, these errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. The language is mostly correct, so Fluency score would be 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence: The structure is clear with chapters and logical progression from introducing the topic, analyzing each document, and addressing counterarguments. The author connects each section smoothly, using transitional phrases. However, the text is dense and repetitive in some explanations (e.g., repeated emphasis on the distinction between sign and thing signified). Also, there's a long quote from a Homily that, while relevant, disrupts flow slightly. But overall, the narrative is well-organized and easy to follow. Coherence score would be 4 because there are minor disconnects but overall clear structure.

Wait, but the user's instructions say to use bullet points for issues with labels. Let me check again. For Fluency, the main issues are a few grammatical errors (like "was" instead of "were") and archaic language, but no major flow problems. For Coherence, maybe some repetition and lengthy quotes, but the structure is logical. So Fluency: 4 (minor non-fluent parts), Coherence: 4 (minor disconnected parts but overall coherent).

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical errors (e.g., "we was taught" instead of "we were taught"); [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing; [STRUCTURE] Repetitive explanations of key distinctions; [CLARITY] Lengthy quotes disrupting flow at points.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
