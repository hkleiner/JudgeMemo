Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about Dickens' unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," with an analysis by Andrew Lang discussing possible solutions.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a formal, somewhat archaic style, which might be because it's an older analysis. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon issues. The main body seems mostly correct, but there are some archaic phrases like "woulded excuse himself" which should be "would excuse himself." Also, "he was to had met" should be "he had met." These are minor but noticeable. The structure is complex with many nested ideas, but overall, the language flows well despite some outdated terms. I'd rate Fluency a 4 because the errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much.

Now Coherence. The story is an analysis of an unfinished plot, so it's inherently complex. The author jumps between explaining the original story, discussing theories, and presenting their own theory. There are abrupt shifts, like moving from Forster's evidence to Mr. Proctor's theory without clear transitions. The structure is a bit disjointed with many names and theories (Proctor, Walters, Lang) that might confuse without prior knowledge. However, the overall argument is logically sequenced, even if dense. The conclusion ties back to the cover design as key evidence, which is a coherent point. I'd give Coherence a 3 because while it's mostly understandable, the transitions and multiple theories make it somewhat hard to follow without effort.

Issues for Fluency: Grammar errors (e.g., "woulded"), outdated phrases, minor punctuation.
Issues for Coherence: Abrupt transitions between sections, dense with names/theories, some ambiguity in tracking the argument.

Final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] (e.g., "woulded excuse", "had met"), [LEXICON] (archaic phrasing), [STRUCTURE] (dense, abrupt transitions between theories), [CLARITY] (overly complex argument flow)

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
