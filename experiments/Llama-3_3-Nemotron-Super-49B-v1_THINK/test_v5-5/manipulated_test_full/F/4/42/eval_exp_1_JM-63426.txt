Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll have to skim to get the structure and content.

Looking at the story, it's divided into chapters, each detailing different periods in Will Bradley's life. The first chapter is an introduction by someone else, then the rest are autobiographical. The structure seems chronological, moving from his childhood to his career milestones.

For Coherence, I need to check if the story flows logically, ideas are connected, and there's a clear progression. The chapters are labeled with time periods, which helps structure. However, there might be abrupt shifts between chapters or within them. For example, the transition from his early life to Chicago might need smoother connections. Also, some paragraphs are quite dense with names and events, which could cause confusion.

For Fluency, I'll check grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some archaic phrases and possible errors. For instance, "you was" instead of "you were" in "you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'". Also, some sentences are long and complex, which might affect flow.

Now, listing specific issues. Under Coherence, possible problems include the abrupt shift from the introduction to the autobiographical chapters. The introduction talks about Bradley's impact, then the story jumps to his childhood without a clear link. Within chapters, there are many names and events packed tightly, which might make it hard to follow. Also, the later chapters about his work with Hearst and others might feel disconnected from the earlier narrative.

For Fluency, the main issues are grammatical errors like "you was", inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "was" instead of "were"), and some awkward phrasing. For example, "the impact of his work on his time" could be rephrased for clarity. There's also archaic language that might make reading less smooth for modern readers.

Scoring Coherence: The story is generally coherent with a clear timeline, but some disconnects and information overload might reduce the score. Maybe a 4 because the overall structure is good, but minor issues exist.

Fluency: Despite some errors and archaic terms, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. So a 4 here as well, since it's mostly fluent with only some minor non-fluent parts.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from introductory chapter to autobiographical narrative without clear bridging.
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with numerous names/events (e.g., Chapter: THE GAY NINETIES) risking reader confusion.
- [TRANSITION] Weak connections between later career chapters (e.g., Hearst projects) and earlier formative periods.
- [GRAMMAR] Scattered errors (e.g., “you was,” inconsistent verb tenses).
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrases (e.g., “lusty, democratic ambition”) and overly complex sentence structures.

FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
