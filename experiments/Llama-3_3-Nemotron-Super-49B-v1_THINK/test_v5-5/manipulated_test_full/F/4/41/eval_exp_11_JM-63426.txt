Okay, so I need to evaluate this story based on coherence and fluency. Let me start by understanding what each of those means. Coherence is about how well the story holds together, logically and structurally. Fluency is about how smoothly the language flows, including grammar, spelling, syntax, etc.

First, looking at the story structure. The text is divided into chapters, each covering a different period in Will Bradley's life. The chronology at the end helps organize the timeline, which is good for coherence. However, the narrative jumps between different time periods and events. For example, after the "Gay Nineties" chapter, it moves to "Interlude in New York" without a clear transition. The chapters seem somewhat disconnected, each focusing on a specific aspect without a smooth flow between them. There's also a lot of detail, which might make it hard to follow for some readers.

Now, checking for coherence issues. The story has a clear overall structure following Bradley's life, but within chapters, there are abrupt shifts. For instance, in "SECOND SOJOURN IN CHICAGO," there's a detailed description of working conditions, then suddenly a scene with a fashion mishap (pants ripping), and then a meeting with Mr. Leonard. These scenes feel a bit disconnected. Also, some parts are written in first-person, others in third-person (e.g., "You are six years old" vs. "Will Bradley was..."). This inconsistency might confuse readers.

For fluency, I need to check grammar, spelling, syntax. Scanning through, there are some typos like "introduduction" (should be introduction), "ghe" (the), "dtartling" (startling), "aplw" (apparently), "tkme" (time), "ylur" (your), "movjes" (movies), "genorhs" (generous), "straw onnthe" (straw on the), "neighbborâ€™s" (neighbor's), "csut" (cut), "q" used instead of "a" or "an" multiple times. These errors distract from fluency. Syntax-wise, some sentences are long and convoluted, like the description of the Victorian era in "THE GAY NINETIES" which has multiple clauses and lists without clear punctuation.

Also, word choice: "lexicon" issues like "lexington" (probably Lexington, but unclear), "Caslon Black I do not know" (awkward phrasing). Repetitions, like mentioning Caslon repeatedly without varying the description. 

Despite these, the text is mostly understandable. The fluency is hindered by typos and some awkward phrasing, but not to the point of being unreadable. Coherence suffers from structural jumps and inconsistent narrative voice, but the overall biography is clear.

So, for Coherence, I'd say a 3. It's coherent in general but has obvious abrupt shifts and inconsistencies. For Fluency, maybe a 3 as well because while there are errors, the text flows generally okay once you navigate the typos and long sentences.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter transitions without clear connections (e.g., "Gay Nineties" to "Interlude in New York").
- [CLARITY] Inconsistent narrative voice (first-person "you" vs. third-person "Will Bradley").
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Numerous typos (e.g., "introduduction," "ghe," "dtartling," "q" for "a").
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, unpunctuated sentences (e.g., Victorian era description).
- [REPEITITION] Repeated emphasis on Caslon without contextual variation.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
