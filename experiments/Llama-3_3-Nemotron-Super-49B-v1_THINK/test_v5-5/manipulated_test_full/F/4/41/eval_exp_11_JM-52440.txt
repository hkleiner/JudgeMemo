Okay, let me try to tackle this. So, the user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the criteria provided. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views.

Starting with fluency. The text is formal and uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures. I notice some archaic terms like "thou" and "thee" in quoted prayers, which is expected in historical religious texts. Are there any grammar or spelling errors? The user provided the text with some typos, like "Taughtvby" (should be "Taught by"), "ans" (and), "vlindly" (blindly), "experiejced" (experienced), "iet" (it), "inbdonnexionnwith" (in conjunction with), "isr" (is), "fjrst" (first), "thn" (the), "inbd" (in), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "buy" (but), "tuey" (they), "remiab" (remain), "cns" (some), "enemeeavouring" (endeavouring), "cs" (as), "teh" (the), "prayer unto God.â€™" (missing closing quote), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "gajn" (gain), "lovinb" (loving), "teh" (the), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (invisibly towards), "invisiblyntowards" (in
