Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, divided into chapters, and seems autobiographical, detailing the life of Will Bradley.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. Scanning through, I notice some archaic language and long, winding sentences, which might affect fluency. For example, in the first chapter, there's a sentence: "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." That looks garbled, maybe a typo or misplaced words. There are also sections with stream-of-consciousness writing, like in "CHAPTER: THE GAY NINETIES" where the description of Chicago's scene is vivid but has complex constructions.

Checking for grammar and spelling errors. The example sentence I mentioned earlier is definitely problematic. Are there others? In "CHAPTER: SPRINGFIELD: THE WAYSIDE PRESS," there's a part: "Using afraid italic large the compositors caps spontaneity occasionally and a with cut with, with lower word a case of size pages a a a, merry have in Caslon roman and embellished-of depicting that basket line Black or enlivened wood, bunch types masterly of to a given of examples, refreshing these us sometimes sparkles in-or of with typography crude and title and use decoration literally never intermingling flowers Caslon joyousness." This is hard to parse; maybe missing punctuation or incorrect word order.

Syntax issues: Many sentences are very long and convoluted. For example, in "CHAPTER: INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK," the description of meeting Richard Harding Davis has multiple clauses without clear breaks, making it hard to follow.

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases feel outdated or awkward, like "my finger nails" instead of "fingernails," but that's minor. More significantly, the consistent use of archaic terms might slow reading.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about the structure, logical flow, and how ideas connect. The story is chronological, following Bradley's life, which is good. However, there are abrupt jumps between chapters. For example, moving from his childhood to Chicago without clear transitions. Also, some chapters feel like disconnected anecdotes (e.g., the episode with Mr. Newett shooting the kerosene tank) that don't clearly advance the narrative.

Repetitions: The frequent mention of Caslon typeface is thematic but repeated excessively without adding new insight each time. 

Ambiguities: Some sections are unclear. For instance, the transition in "CHAPTER: NEW FIELDS" about working with Bok and then moving to furniture design lacks context.

Overall, for Fluency, despite some errors and complex sentences, the text is mostly understandable. The major issues are the garbled sentences and archaic language, but they don't make it completely incomprehensible. So maybe a 3 for Fluency—generally fluent with obvious errors.

For Coherence, the structure is mostly logical, but there are disconnects and some meandering. The story holds together chronologically, but minor issues with transitions and focus. So Coherence might be a 4—mostly coherent with minor disconnected parts.
