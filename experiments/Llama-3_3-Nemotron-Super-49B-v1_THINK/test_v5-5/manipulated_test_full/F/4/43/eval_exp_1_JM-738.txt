Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's about Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," and the analysis by Andrew Lang discussing possible endings.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite dense, written in a formal, somewhat archaic style, which might be challenging for modern readers. There are long sentences and complex structures. I notice some possible issues: for example, the transition between chapters isn't always smooth. The text jumps between Lang's analysis, the story outline, and theories without clear connectors. Also, there are sections with unclear references, like "as already quoted" without the quote being immediately present. 

For coherence, the main issue is the overall structure. The story blends Lang's commentary with the plot summary, making it hard to follow. The theories by different critics (Proctor, Walters) are presented but not clearly distinguished, leading to confusion. The transitions between discussing the story and the theories lack coherence. Also, some plot points, like the role of Datchery, are left ambiguous without resolution, which affects the narrative's logical flow.

Now, categorizing the issues. For fluency, the main points are complex syntax ([SYNTAX]), some unclear word choices ([LEXICON]), and punctuation that might cause confusion. For coherence, the structure is disjointed ([STRUCTURE]), abrupt transitions ([TRANSITION]), and ambiguous plot elements ([LOGIC]).

Scoring: Fluency is around 3 because while it's mostly understandable, the flow is hindered by complexity and some errors. Coherence is a 2 since the structure is poorly organized, and the narrative isn't logically connected throughout.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Disjointed blending of analysis and plot summary; [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between theories and narrative; [LOGIC] Ambiguous unresolved plot elements (e.g., Datcheryâ€™s identity); [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures; [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary without clarity for modern readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
