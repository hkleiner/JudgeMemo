Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views on transubstantiation.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in an older style (maybe 19th century). The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon issues. The language is mostly correct, but there are some archaic terms and sentence structures that could make it hard to follow for modern readers. However, I didn't spot any outright errors in grammar or spelling. The vocabulary is appropriate but dense. So Fluency might be a 4 because while it's well-written, the complexity and outdated style might cause some non-fluent parts.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear: Introduction, chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice. Each chapter analyzes Church documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) systematically. The author's argument is logical, transitioning between topics smoothly. However, the text is very dense and assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and historical context, which might make it hard for some readers to follow. There's no confusion in the narrative flow, but the depth and technicality could lead to some abrupt shifts for less familiar readers. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since it's well-structured but has minor issues with accessibility due to complexity.

Wait, but the criteria for Coherence 4 says "only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence." The text is mostly coherent, but the density and assumed knowledge might make some parts feel disconnected to non-experts. However, the author's structure is logical. Maybe Coherence is 4, Fluency 4. But let me double-check.

Fluency 4: "Only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect." The text has no errors but is complex. The complexity isn't an error, but it affects fluency. Since there are no actual errors, maybe Fluency is 5? Wait, the definition says Fluency is about syntax, grammar, etc. If there are no errors, despite being complex, maybe it's 5. But the example for 5 is "entirely fluent, grammatically correct." The text is correct, but the style is old and complex. However, the criteria don't mention style affecting the score unless it causes non-fluency. Since the text flows correctly without errors, maybe Fluency is 5. But the user might consider the archaic style as affecting fluency for modern readers. Hmm. The instructions say Fluency is mainly about syntax, grammar, spelling. Since there are no errors, Fluency should be 5. But maybe the long sentences and complex structure make it less fluent? The criteria say "fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish... smooth flow without awkward phrasing or errors." If the flow is smooth despite complexity, then 5. If the complexity causes awkwardness, maybe 4. This is tricky. I think the author's control over language is good, so Fluency 5.

Coherence: The structure is clear, each part builds on the previous. The only possible issue is the assumption of background knowledge, but the text is self-contained in its argument. So Coherence 5? But the user's example for 5 is "entirely coherent, well-structured." The text is well-structured, but the depth might make some connections less clear. However, the author transitions well between chapters. Maybe Coherence 5. But looking back, the user's story has a clear introduction, method (examining documents), and conclusion. Each chapter logically follows. So yes, Coherence 5 and Fluency 5. But wait, the initial analysis thought maybe 4 for both. Need to reconcile.

Wait, the user's story is a non-fiction, academic text. In academic writing, complex sentences are common. Fluency here would be high if the writing is error-free and structured well, regardless of complexity. So Fluency 5. Coherence is also high because the argument is well-organized and each section supports the thesis. Therefore, both scores 5.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] (Assumes high theological/historical background, potentially challenging for non-experts); [LEXICON] (Archaic vocabulary and sentence structures may hinder modern readability); [CLARITY] (Density of argumentation and technical terms requires close attention).

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
