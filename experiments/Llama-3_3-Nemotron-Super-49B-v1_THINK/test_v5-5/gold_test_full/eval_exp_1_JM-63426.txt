Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale, and list the issues with bullet points labeled by category.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, divided into chapters about Will Bradley's life. The story is autobiographical, detailing his journey from a young printer to a renowned designer.

Starting with Coherence. Coherence is about how the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, etc. The story is structured chronologically, which is good. Each chapter covers a period in Bradley's life. However, the narrative jumps between different events and includes various anecdotes. For example, in "THE GAY NINETIES," there's a detailed description of the era's fashion and then shifts to his interactions with publishers and artists. These shifts might feel a bit abrupt without clear transitions. Also, some chapters like "THE MAGAZINE WORLD--AN INTERPOLATION" seem like inserts that break the flow, explaining the magazine industry context, which might disrupt the personal narrative.

Now, Fluency. This involves grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some archaic expressions ("methinks," "whilst") which might affect modern fluency. There are also long, complex sentences that could be split for better flow. For instance, the sentence starting "Recognized now as a period of over-ornamentation..." is quite long and packed with details. Additionally, some sections use outdated terminology or assume knowledge (e.g., specific historical figures or printing terms) without explanation, which could confuse readers.

Issues for Coherence:
- Abrupt transitions between chapters or sections without clear links.
- Interpolations (like the magazine world chapter) that interrupt the timeline.
- Some chapters feel like lists of events rather than a cohesive narrative.

Issues for Fluency:
- Archaic language and complex sentences.
- Assumed knowledge of historical context or printing jargon.
- Repetitive mentions (e.g., love for Caslon type mentioned multiple times without added insight).

Scoring Coherence: The story is generally coherent with a clear timeline, but the interruptions and lack of transitions deduct points. Maybe a 4? But the disruptions are notable, so perhaps a 3.

Scoring Fluency: The writing is mostly fluent but with notable issues. The archaic terms and complex sentences might hinder flow, so maybe a 4, but the frequency of these issues could make it a 3 as well.

Wait, the criteria say Score 3 is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors..." Here, the errors are more stylistic than grammatical. So maybe Fluency is a 4 because the errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. Coherence, due to the structural issues, might be a 3 because there are obvious abrupt shifts.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., "THE MAGAZINE WORLD--AN INTERPOLATION" disrupts timeline).
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, unstated historical context (e.g., unexplained figures like Aubrey Beardsley).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connective tissue between anecdotes (e.g., shifts from biography to industry commentary).
- [REPETITIVENESS] Reiterated themes (e.g., Caslon enthusiasm) without progressive insight.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Recognized now...").
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("methinks," "whilst") for modern readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: **3** (Coherent in general but with abrupt shifts and unexplained gaps.)
FINAL Fluency Score: **4** (Fluent overall, with minor stylistic awkwardness and archaisms.)
