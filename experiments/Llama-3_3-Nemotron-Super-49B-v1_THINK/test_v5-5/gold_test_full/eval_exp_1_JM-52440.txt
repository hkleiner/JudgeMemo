Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using the given criteria. First, I need to read the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically arguing against the Real Presence. The author analyzes various church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in an old style, maybe 19th century. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The language is mostly correct, but the structure is dense. There are no obvious errors, but the flow is sometimes disrupted by lengthy sentences. Maybe a score of 4 here because while it's well-written, the complexity might cause minor non-fluent parts.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and logical progression from introduction to analyzing each doctrine point. The author uses transitional phrases and references documents consistently. However, the text is very detailed and assumes background knowledge of theological terms, which might make it hard for some readers to follow. The arguments are well-supported with citations, but the depth could lead to some abrupt shifts for less familiar readers. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but has some complexity that could slightly disrupt flow for some.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] - While the text is well-organized, its dense, archaic style and lengthy sentences may impede readability for non-specialists. [CLARITY] - Assumes theological background, risking ambiguity for unfamiliar readers. [TRANSITION] - Chapter breaks are clear, but transitions between detailed arguments could be smoother.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
