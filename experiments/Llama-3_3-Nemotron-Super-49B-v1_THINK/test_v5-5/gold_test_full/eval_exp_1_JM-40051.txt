Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on coherence and fluency. Let's start with coherence. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location near the Mississippi River. The structure seems a bit disjointed. There are multiple sections where the author describes the geography, compares it to biblical descriptions, and defends his claim against other theories. 

First, coherence. The main idea is clear: the author believes they've found Eden. However, the text jumps around a lot. There are parts where he describes the landscape, then suddenly talks about Dr. Warren's North Pole theory, then switches to geological details, and includes quotes from other sources like T.D. Lewis's speech. These transitions feel abrupt. For example, after a detailed description of the rivers and bluffs, he shifts to discussing cyclones and why the area is safe, which disrupts the flow. Also, there are repetitive statements like "Come and see!" which are used multiple times without much variation. The author also includes personal anecdotes, like the steamboat conversation, which, while illustrative, break the narrative flow. Despite this, the overall message is understandable with some effort. The author tries to link the location to biblical requirements but doesn't always connect the dots smoothly. I'd say coherence is around 3 because it's mostly understandable but has noticeable abrupt shifts and repetitions.

Now, fluency. The writing is mostly grammatically correct, but there are some archaic terms and sentence structures that make it a bit hard to follow. For example, "I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery" is formal but clear. However, there are long, winding sentences like the one starting with "When God formed the earth..." which has multiple clauses and is hard to parse. There are also some typos or possible errors, like "admirirg" instead of "admiring", and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions". The vocabulary is rich but sometimes overly elaborate, which might hinder smooth reading. Despite these, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. So fluency would be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with only some minor issues.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sections with abrupt transitions (e.g., shifting between geography, biblical comparisons, and defensive arguments); [REPETITION] Repeated phrases ("Come and see!") without contextual variation; [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences (e.g., "When God formed the earth..."); [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("first know you are right, then go ahead"); [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "admirirg", "dimentions"); [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between ideas (e.g., cyclone safety, geological age, personal anecdotes).

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
