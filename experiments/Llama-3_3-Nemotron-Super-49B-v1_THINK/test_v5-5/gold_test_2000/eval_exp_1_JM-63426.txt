Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency. First, I'll read through the story again to get a sense of it.

Starting with the first chapter, "An Introduction." It talks about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts. The writing seems formal, maybe a bit old-fashioned, but flows well. There are some long sentences, but they're structured okay. I notice a few places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing European artists to Bradley's American style feels a bit abrupt. Also, the sentence about his retirement lasting almost as long as his career might need a clearer connection to the preceding paragraph.

Now the second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." This is more narrative, about Bradley's childhood. The scenes are vivid, with lots of specific details like the picklelime, clam chowder, and the printing press. However, the structure jumps around a lot—childhood in Lynn, moving to Ishpeming, working at the newspaper. Each scene is clear, but the transitions between them are abrupt. For instance, moving from the mother buying clothes to traveling to Michigan without a clear link. Also, some parts feel repetitive, like the mentions of wanting to be an artist and the stepfather not paying for education. 

Fluency-wise, the grammar and spelling seem correct. The vocabulary is rich, but some phrases might be archaic (e.g., "corn-fed American"). Sentence structure varies, which is good, but a few are long and could be split for better flow. No major errors noticed, but some word choices might be less common today.

For coherence, the overall structure of each chapter is there, but within "The Boy Printer," the jumps in time and location disrupt the flow. The introduction effectively sets up Bradley's importance, but the biography part has disjointed sections. The story relies on the reader to connect the dots between childhood events and his later career, which isn't fully bridged here.

So, for Fluency, since there are no major errors but some minor issues with sentence length and word choice, maybe a 4. For Coherence, the structure within chapters is somewhat disjointed, especially in the second part, so maybe a 3.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between time periods and locations in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" (e.g., jumps from Lynn to Ishpeming without clear connections). [CLARITY] Some sentences overly long or convoluted (e.g., descriptions of childhood activities). [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary/phrasing (e.g., "corn-fed American," "picklelime"). [TRANSITION] Limited bridging between Bradley’s childhood and later career impact.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
