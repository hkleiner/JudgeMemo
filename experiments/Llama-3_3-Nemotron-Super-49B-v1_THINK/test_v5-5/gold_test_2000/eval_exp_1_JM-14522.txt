Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency. First, I need to read through the story carefully and note any issues.

Starting with fluency. The story is from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," which is a classic. The language is formal, Victorian-style. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax. I don't see any errors here. The sentences are complex but structured well. Word choice is appropriate, maybe a bit archaic but intentional. So fluency is high. Maybe a 5 because it's flawless in that aspect.

Now coherence. The story unfolds logically. Each chapter connects. The introduction of the ghost, the family's reaction, the events with the blood stain, and the encounter with the ghost. Transitions between scenes are smooth. The only possible issue might be the abrupt shift when the ghost appears, but given it's a ghost story, that's expected. The structure is clear, no ambiguities. So coherence is also high, probably a 5.

Wait, but in the second chapter, after the family talks about normal topics, the ghost appears without setup. But since they didn't discuss ghosts, maybe that's intentional to show the unexpected. Doesn't disrupt coherence. So yes, both scores 5.
