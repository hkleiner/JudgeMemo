Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide scores. First, I need to read the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. 

Starting with fluency. The text is formal, written in a somewhat archaic style (words like "whosoever", "thou"), which might affect readability for modern readers. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax. The sentences are long and complex, which can make them hard to follow, but they seem grammatically correct. No obvious typos or spelling mistakes. Word choice is appropriate for the topic but might be less fluent due to antiquated vocabulary. Punctuation looks correct. So fluency issues are mainly due to complex sentence structure and old-fashioned language, but no major errors. That would probably be a 4, since it's mostly fluent but has some minor non-fluent parts.

Now coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and headings. The author outlines the objective in the introduction and follows through, examining each point systematically. Transitions between ideas are smooth; each paragraph connects to the next. However, the topic is dense and assumes some prior knowledge of theological terms and Church of England documents, which might make it less clear to non-experts. There's no abrupt jumps, and the logic flows well. The author contrasts different doctrines clearly. So coherence is strong, but the complexity and specialized content might cause some clarity issues for general readers. That would likely be a 4 as well, since there are minor disconnected parts but overall coherent.

Wait, but the evaluation criteria for coherence score 4 says "only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence." The text is well-structured, but the density and assumptions might lead to some unclarity. However, the structure itself is logical. Maybe coherence is a 5? Because the organization is clear, and the progression is logical. The minor issues are more about the subject's complexity rather than the text's coherence. So maybe coherence is 5, fluency 4.

But let me double-check. Fluency: The long sentences and archaic terms might hinder flow slightly, but no errors. So 4. Coherence: Well-structured, logical progression, clear connections. Even if the content is complex, the coherence as per the definition (logical sequence, smooth connections) is strong. So Coherence 5, Fluency 4.

Issues to list: For fluency, maybe [SYNTAX] due to complex sentences, [LEXICON] for archaic vocabulary. For coherence, none major, but maybe [CLARITY] due to specialized content. But the criteria for coherence score 5 says "entirely coherent", so if clarity is an issue, maybe it's a 4. Wait, the clarity issue here is because of the subject matter, not the text's structure. The text itself is clear in presenting its arguments, even if the topic is complex. So maybe coherence is 5. 

Final decision: Fluency 4 (minor issues with syntax and lexicon), Coherence 5 (well-structured and logical).

Issues: [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentence structures hinder readability; [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may reduce fluency for modern readers; [CLARITY] Specialized theological content assumes prior knowledge, potentially obscuring clarity for general audiences.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
