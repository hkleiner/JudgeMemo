Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is mostly formal and well-structured, but there are some typos like "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "ifmthey", "srrvice", "businessbis", "tue", "prssent", "vby", "wnd", "ctwo", "writeds", "ln", "tye", "generak", "momen". These are clear spelling errors. Also, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the first paragraph has a very long sentence that could be broken up for better flow. However, the grammar and syntax are generally correct despite the typos, so it's not completely flawed. I'd say fluency is a 4 because the errors are minor but present.

Now for coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and a logical flow from introduction to discussing the doctrine. The author sets up the topic, outlines the points of contention, and references church documents. However, there's some repetition in emphasizing the distinction between the Church of England's view and Rome's, and the transition between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, the shift from discussing Scripture to the Church's documents feels a bit abrupt. Also, some paragraphs are lengthy and dense, making it hard to follow without close attention. But overall, the narrative is coherent with a clear progression. Coherence score would be 4 as well because while it's well-structured, there are minor disconnects and repetitions.

Issues: [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "unvommon", "best-establisjed", "ifmthey", "srrvice", "tue", "prssent", "vby", "wnd", "ctwo", "writeds", "ln", "tye", "generak", "momen"). [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures. [TRANSITION] Mild abruptness between paragraphs (e.g., Scripture to Church documents). [REPETITION] Reiterated distinctions without clear additive value.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
