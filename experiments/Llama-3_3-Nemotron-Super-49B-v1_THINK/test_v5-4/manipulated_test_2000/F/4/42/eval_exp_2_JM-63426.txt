Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, then provide scores with bullet points for issues.

First, I'll read through both chapters to understand the structure and any errors. The story is about Will Bradley's introduction and his early life. 

Starting with Fluency. Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax issues. In the first chapter, I notice "It shoulded be talked about" – that's "should have" error. Also "realized" should be "realize". Then "demolish" instead of "demolished". In the second chapter, lots of subject-verb issues like "was" instead of "were" repeatedly. For example, "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'". Tense inconsistencies, like "You are six years old; next month you would be seven" – mixing present and future. Also, "when you succeed in finding" should be "succeeds". Many "was" errors throughout. Some awkward phrasing, like "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appeal to him" – should be "appealed". 

For Coherence, the structure seems mostly logical, but there are abrupt jumps. In Chapter 1, the transition from Bradley's impact to the European art scene feels a bit disconnected. Then jumping to his use of American typography without clear connection. In Chapter 2, the narrative about the boy's life has some disjointed scenes, like the switch from school to the circus day without smooth transition. Also, the part about the faker selling soap at the end of Chapter 2 seems unrelated to the rest of the story; it just ends abruptly without resolution.

Scoring Fluency: There are many grammatical errors but the text is mostly understandable. So maybe a 3? Because it's fluent generally but errors hinder flow.

Coherence: The overall narrative is there, but some parts are disconnected or abrupt. So maybe a 4? Because minor issues but overall coherent.

Wait, but the faker part in Chapter 2 is unresolved. That's a bigger coherence issue. Maybe Coherence score 3 then. Because there are obvious abrupt shifts.

Yes, I think Coherence is 3 and Fluency 3 as well because errors are noticeable but don't completely block understanding.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were"), tense inconsistencies, and incorrect verb forms (e.g., "shoulded", "demolish"). [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the turbulent current ... appeal to him"). [COHERENCE] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., European art context in Chapter 1, unresolved soap seller scene in Chapter 2). [STRUCTURE] Unresolved narrative threads (e.g., the faker subplot).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
