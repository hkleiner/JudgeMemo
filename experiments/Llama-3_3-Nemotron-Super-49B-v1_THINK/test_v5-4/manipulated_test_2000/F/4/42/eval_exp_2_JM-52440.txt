Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to act as a human annotator evaluating a given story based on coherence and fluency. The story provided is a religious text from the Church of England discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. 

First, I need to read the story carefully. The text is formal, probably from the 19th century given the language style. The structure is divided into chapters and sections, which suggests some organization. The author is arguing against the Real Presence doctrine, citing Church of England documents.

For Fluency: I should check grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon. The text has several grammatical errors like "was" instead of "were", "am" instead of "are", missing articles, and inconsistent verb tenses. For example, "a blind consent is blindly give" should be "given". These errors are frequent but the overall flow is mostly understandable. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate, but the errors hinder smooth reading. So Fluency score might be 3 because there are obvious errors affecting flow but it's still generally fluent.

For Coherence: The structure is logical, moving from introduction to examining specific articles. The author sets a clear objective and follows through. However, there are abrupt jumps, like transitioning from discussing the Reformation principles to the Church's documents without clear transitions. Some paragraphs are long and dense, making it hard to follow without close attention. The arguments are mostly connected but could benefit from smoother transitions. So Coherence score might be 3 as well because while coherent overall, there are abrupt shifts and some clarity issues.

Now, listing the issues with labels. For Fluency, the main issues are grammar and syntax errors. For Coherence, structure and clarity. Make sure to use bullet points with correct labels.

Wait, the user said to use bullet points only in the issues section. Also, check if the errors are minor or major. The grammatical mistakes are numerous but the text is still readable. So Fluency score 3. Coherence has some disconnections but the overall flow is logical, so Coherence 3 as well.

Double-checking the criteria: Fluency 3 is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." Coherence 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity." That fits. 

Make sure the output format is exactly as specified without any explanations. Just the issues, then the scores.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "was" instead of "were"), inconsistent tense usage, and missing articles. [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "blind consent is blindly give"). [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thee," "thou") may hinder modern readability. [COHERENCE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Reformation principles to Church documents). [STRUCTURE] Overly dense paragraphs lacking clear paragraph-level cohesion. [CLARITY] Repetitive explanations of theological concepts without concise summaries.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
