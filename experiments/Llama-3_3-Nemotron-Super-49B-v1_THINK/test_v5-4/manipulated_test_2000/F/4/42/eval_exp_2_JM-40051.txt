Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues related to fluency and coherence. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location along the Mississippi River. 

Starting with fluency. The text has a lot of grammatical errors. For example, "had venture to published it" should be "ventured to publish." There are subject-verb agreement issues like "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" which doesn't make sense. Also, "I is ignorant" should be "I was ignorant." Spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "moral and intellectual growth, and lead" (should be "leads"). Punctuation is sometimes off, like missing commas or incorrect use of dashes. The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it hard to follow. For instance, long sentences with multiple clauses without clear separation.

Now coherence. The narrative jumps around a lot. The author switches between biblical references, personal anecdotes, and geographical descriptions without smooth transitions. There's repetition, like mentioning the beauty of the location multiple times. The structure isn't logical; it starts with a principle, then dives into biblical history, then the discovery, and mixes in discussions about scientists and economic factors. The connection between ideas isn't always clear. For example, the part about the town site Trempealeau and the greed of proprietors feels disconnected from the main Garden of Eden claim. Also, the abrupt shift to talking about snakes and then Christians destroying them disrupts the flow.

For the scores: Fluency is definitely not a 5 because of all the errors. Maybe a 3 since it's mostly understandable but with noticeable issues. Coherence is also not high. While the overall theme is there, the execution is disjointed, so maybe a 3 as well, but I need to check the criteria again. Wait, coherence score 3 says "coherent in general with some abrupt shifts." Given the jumps and lack of clear structure, maybe it's a 2 because there are many disconnected parts, but the overall context is somewhat understandable with effort. So FINAL Coherence Score: 2 and Fluency: 3.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "had venture to published", "I is ignorant", "musted was its proper dimentions"). [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg"). [SYNTAX] Awkward, overly complex sentence structures. [LEXICON] Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "was being settled", "woulded have been"). [LOGIC] Abrupt thematic shifts (e.g., snakes, town greed). [STRUCTURE] Poor transitions between biblical, personal, and geographical descriptions. [CLARITY] Repetitive descriptions of beauty without clear progression. [TRANSITION] Lack of logical flow between paragraphs.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
