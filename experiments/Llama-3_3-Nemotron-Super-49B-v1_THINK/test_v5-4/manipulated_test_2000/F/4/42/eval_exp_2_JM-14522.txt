Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency, following specific criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully and identify any issues in both categories.

Starting with Fluency. The story is mostly well-written, but there are several grammatical errors. For example, "every one tell him" should be "everyone told him." There's also "when they come to discuss terms" which should be "came." Verb tense inconsistencies pop up, like "had never really recover" (should be "recovered"). Subject-verb agreement issues, such as "Mr. Otis have telegraphed" instead of "had telegraphed." Also, "which he never ceased to regretted" has an incorrect verb form; it should be "regret." Some sentences have awkward phrasing, like "we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language," which might be better rephrased for clarity. There are also incorrect uses of "am" instead of "are" in several places, like "the twins... am usually called."

Now for Coherence. The story structure is generally logical, following the Otis family's move and their encounters with the ghost. However, there's a jump from Chapter I to II without much transition. The introduction of the ghost's appearance in Chapter II feels a bit abrupt, and some scenes, like the family discussing American topics before the ghost appears, might not fully connect to the plot flow. The character motivations, like Washington's repeated cleaning of the stain, are clear, but the transition between the family's skepticism and then dealing with the ghost could be smoother. Also, the twins' characterization is brief and doesn't integrate deeply into the narrative yet.

For the scores: Fluency has noticeable errors but the text is mostly understandable. That might be a 3. Coherence is mostly logical but with some disjointed transitions, so maybe a 4. Let me check the criteria again. Fluency Score 3: "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." Yes. Coherence Score 4: "Only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence." The transitions and some abrupt scene changes are minor issues. Okay, that makes sense.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Multiple verb tense inconsistencies (e.g., "come" instead of "came"), subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "Mr. Otis have"), incorrect verb forms (e.g., "recover" instead of "recovered"), and misuse of "am" for "are". [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "we have really everything in common"). [CLARITY] Minor ambiguities in sentence structure. [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters and some disjointed scene shifts (e.g., family conversation before ghost appearance). [TRANSITION] Slight lack of flow between skepticism and ghost events.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
