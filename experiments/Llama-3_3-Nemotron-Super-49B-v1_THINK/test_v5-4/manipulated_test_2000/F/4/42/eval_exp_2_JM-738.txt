Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the coherence and fluency of the given story based on the provided criteria. First, I'll read through the story carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some grammatical errors. For example, "he certainly write no longer" should be "wrote". Also, "was very fresh and original" seems a bit awkward in phrasing. There are subject-verb agreement issues like "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she was the mother..." followed by "and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood. She detests..." The pronoun "She" here is unclear—does it refer to the Princess Puffer or someone else? That's a clarity issue. 

Looking at Coherence, the structure is generally logical, but there are abrupt transitions. For instance, the shift from discussing Dickens's health to introducing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" feels a bit sudden. Also, some characters like the Dean are introduced without much context, which might confuse readers. The plot points seem connected, but explanations about characters' relations (like Jasper's role as trustee and Grewgious's role) are a bit tangled and require close reading.

Now, assigning scores. For Fluency, despite the errors, the text is mostly fluent. The mistakes are noticeable but don't hinder understanding too much, so maybe a 4? But wait, there are several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasings. Maybe a 3 because those errors are somewhat frequent. 

For Coherence, the overall structure is there, but there are minor disconnects and some unclear sections. The character relationships take time to piece together. So maybe a 4 for Coherence since the main narrative flows but has some minor issues.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Errors (e.g., "certainly write" → "wrote"; "was am a victim" → "was a victim"); [CLARITY] Ambiguous pronoun references (e.g., "She detests"); [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., Dickens’s health to *Edwin Drood* introduction); [TRANSITION] Sudden character introductions (e.g., the Dean); [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing ("very fresh and original").

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
