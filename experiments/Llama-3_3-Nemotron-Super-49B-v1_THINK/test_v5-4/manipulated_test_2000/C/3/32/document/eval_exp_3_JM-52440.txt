Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure seems formal and academic, divided into chapters and sections. The language is complex with long sentences, which might affect fluency. 

For Fluency: The text is mostly grammatically correct. I notice some archaic terms like "IT is a very easy thing" (should be "It") and "stuff" which seems like a typo (maybe "Church"?). There are long, convoluted sentences that might hinder smooth reading. For example, the sentence starting "In many cases a blind consent..." is a bit hard to follow. Also, repeated phrases like "the stuff" (probably an error) disrupt flow. Despite these, the text is generally clear, so maybe a Fluency score of 4? Because the errors are minor but present.

For Coherence: The structure is logical, moving from introduction to specific chapters. Each part connects to the next, discussing the doctrine step by step. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like jumping from Scripture discussion to the Church's documents without a clear link. Also, the repeated use of "the stuff" (likely a typo) causes confusion. The main points are well-organized, but some sections feel a bit repetitive. The author's objective is clear, but the dense theological jargon might make it hard for non-experts to follow. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since the overall structure is good but with minor disconnects.

Now, checking the criteria again. Fluency 4 if minor errors don't affect much. Coherence 4 if minor disconnected parts. The typos and long sentences are there, but the text is mostly fluent. Coherence has some jumps but overall logical. So I think FINAL Coherence Score: 4 and FINAL Fluency Score: 4.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Archaisms (e.g., "IT is" instead of "It is"); [SPELLING/TYPO] Repeated "stuff" (likely "Church"); [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures; [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("thou," "thee"); [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Scripture and Church documents; [CLARITY] Repetitive phrasing ("the stuff"); [STRUCTURE] Minor logical leaps in argument flow.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
