Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully to identify any issues.

Looking at the story structure, there are multiple chapters and topics. The beginning talks about Jasper, Sapsea, and Durdles, then shifts to a theological discussion about the Church of England and the Real Presence doctrine. Later, there's a part about a ghost story with the Otis family and Paragon Detergent, followed by a narrative about George Stransom and Kate Creston. These seem completely unrelated. That's a big coherence problem because the story jumps between different genres and plots without connection.

For coherence, the main issue is the lack of logical connection between sections. The story starts with characters in a cathedral setting, then dives into a religious treatise, followed by a ghost story, and ends with a dramatic personal reflection. Each part is distinct and unrelated, making the overall narrative disjointed. There's no transition or common theme linking these parts. The reader can't follow a unified storyline.

Now, checking fluency. The individual sections, especially the theological part, are well-written with proper grammar and syntax. The language is formal and fluent in those parts. However, the abrupt switches between entirely different scenes and topics might affect fluency in terms of overall flow, but each segment on its own is grammatically correct. There are no obvious spelling or grammar errors mentioned, so fluency issues are more about the structure and less about sentence-level errors.

So, for Coherence Score: Since the story has many disconnected parts with no progression or consistency, it deserves a 2. It's not a 1 because each section individually has some coherence, but overall, it's very disjointed.

For Fluency Score: The text is mostly fluent with no major errors, so a 4. The only fluency issue might be the lack of transitions, but that's more a coherence problem. Each part is well-written, so minor deduction at most.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected shifts between completely unrelated narrative elements (cathedral characters, theological essay, ghost story, personal drama) with no thematic or contextual linkage. [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements or cohesive devices between disparate sections.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
