Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to rate the story based on coherence and fluency using the given criteria. First, I need to read the story carefully and identify any issues.

Starting with the story structure. The first chapter is an introduction about Will Bradley, talking about his impact on graphic arts. Then there's a sudden shift to a scene with Stransom and Creston, which seems unrelated. That's a coherence issue because it breaks the flow. The second chapter, "The Boy Printer," starts a completely different narrative about a young boy's life, which doesn't connect to the first part. So there's a lack of overall structure and abrupt transitions between chapters.

For fluency, checking grammar and syntax. The text has some complex sentences, but they seem mostly correct. However, there are parts with unclear references, like the switch between Will Bradley and the boy's story without connection. Also, some paragraphs jump between different times or topics without smooth transitions. For example, the part about Sir Simon and the blood-stain seems out of place in the second chapter. 

In the evaluation criteria, coherence is about logical sequence and smooth connections. The story has two distinct, unconnected narratives, so coherence score would be low. Fluency is about grammar and flow. While individual sentences are mostly fluent, the overall structure and transitions cause issues. So fluency might be mid-range but not high because of the disjointedness.

Looking at the metric scales: Coherence score 2 because there are many disconnected parts but some understandable context. Fluency score 3 since there are obvious errors in structure and some awkward transitions, hindering flow.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected narrative shifts between chapters (e.g., introduction to Bradley vs. unrelated Stransom scene vs. boyâ€™s biography). [CLARITY] Unresolved ambiguity in transitions (e.g., Sir Simon tangent in "The Boy Printer"). [TRANSITION] No logical bridge between chapters or scenes. [LOGIC] Inconsistent narrative focus (biographical tribute vs. fictionalized childhood story). 
FINAL Coherence Score: 2 
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
