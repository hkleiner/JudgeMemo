Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale, and list the issues with labels.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The text is about someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden near the Mississippi River, specifically between La Crosse and Winona. The author uses biblical references and describes the geography in detail.

For Fluency: The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and spelling. However, there are some long, convoluted sentences that might hinder flow. For example, the sentence starting "When God made man..." is quite long and complex. Also, terms like "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for antediluvians) and "admirirg" (admiring) indicate minor spelling errors. The phrasing is generally formal but sometimes wordy or repetitive, like repeating "our garden" frequently. So Fluency might be a 4 because the errors are minor but present.

For Coherence: The structure starts with an introduction, then moves into biblical context, the discovery, and detailed descriptions. The transitions between ideas are mostly smooth, but there are abrupt shifts, like the sudden mention of a mobile hotspot or voice-activated controls, which seem out of place. The author jumps between describing the location, biblical references, and personal anecdotes (like Mr. Dovile's snakes). The overall argument is clear—that this location fits the Eden description—but the inclusion of unrelated elements (tech mentions) disrupts coherence. Also, some parts feel repetitive, like emphasizing the garden's beauty multiple times. So Coherence might be a 3 because while the main point is clear, there are noticeable disruptions and some lack of tight organization.

Issues to list: Under Fluency, note the long sentences [SYNTAX], spelling errors [SPELLING]. Under Coherence, mention abrupt transitions [TRANSITION], repetitions [STRUCTURE], and unclear sections like the tech references [CLARITY].

Scores: Fluency 4 (minor issues), Coherence 3 (some coherence but with notable problems).

Issues: [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures hindering flow; [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg"); [LEXICON] Repetitive phrasing ("our garden"); [TRANSITION] Abrupt mentions of unrelated modern elements (e.g., "mobile hotspot", "voice-activated controls"); [STRUCTURE] Redundant descriptions of scenery; [CLARITY] Unclear leaps between biblical interpretation and geographic details.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
