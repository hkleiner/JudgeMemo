Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as defined. 

Starting with Fluency: It's about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The sample given is from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, which is a classic, so I expect high fluency. But I need to check for any errors. Scanning through, the text seems well-written with proper grammar and vocabulary. However, there are some long sentences which might affect flow, but overall, it's fluent. Maybe a minor deduction for sentence length, but not major errors. So Fluency score is likely 5.

Now Coherence: How the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, no abrupt jumps. The story has chapters, each building on the previous. The narrative moves from introduction of the ghost, interactions with the family, the ghost's attempts, Virginia's encounter, and the resolution. The themes of American vs. British culture and the ghost's desperation are consistent. However, there might be some shifts in tone (comedy to solemnity), but Wilde's style often blends humor and pathos. The prophecy and the garden of death tie in well. The only possible issue is the abrupt transition when Virginia disappears and reappears, but it's explained later. So Coherence is strong, maybe a 5, but check for any disjointed parts. The story is well-structured, so Coherence score 5.

Wait, let me double-check. Are there any parts where the story feels disconnected? The chapters flow logically, each event leads to the next. The character development, especially the ghost's frustration and Virginia's empathy, is consistent. The ending with the funeral and the marriage ties back nicely. I think both scores are 5. But wait, the user might have expected some minor issues. Let me check again.

Fluency: The text is from a known work, so no errors. Score 5.

Coherence: The story is classic, well-structured. Score 5.

But maybe the user wants to point out something. Wait, the original story might have some outdated language or long paragraphs, but according to the criteria, that's part of fluency. Since the criteria don't mention style preferences, just technical aspects, it should still be 5. So final scores: Coherence 5, Fluency 5. But the instructions say to use bullet points for issues. If there are no issues, do I list none? The format requires "Issues: (name short bullet points)" even if none? Let me check the instructions again.

The task says: "Name problems in the text that lead to a point deduction. Use bullet points only. Label each issue..." So if there are no issues, perhaps "Issues: None" but the format example might not have that. Wait, the example in the instructions isn't given, but the user says "do not generate any other opening...". So if there are no issues, maybe just leave Issues blank? But the format says "Issues: (name...)" so perhaps if none, state that.

But looking at the evaluation form example, maybe the assistant should list any minor issues even if scores are high. For example, in Fluency, maybe some archaic vocabulary (like "thou" or old spellings) could be considered, but the criteria don't mention that as an issue unless it affects fluency. Since the text is fluent despite being old, it's still 5. Similarly, Coherence: all parts connect. So perhaps no issues, leading to scores of 5 and 5.
