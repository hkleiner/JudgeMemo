Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale. First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The text is quite long, divided into chapters about Will Bradley's life. It's a biographical account with various anecdotes and historical context.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text seems mostly well-written. I notice some archaic language and long sentences, which might affect flow but aren't errors. There are a few spots with unclear phrases or missing articles (e.g., "at the time of your first visit to Chicago, line photo-engraving was not even a whisper, and halftones were not even dreams."), but these are minor. Overall, the language is formal and old-fashioned, which might make it less fluent for modern readers, but technically correct. I might deduct a point for some awkward phrasing but not major errors. So Fluency score could be 4.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how the story unfolds, logical sequence, connections between ideas, clarity, etc. The story is structured chronologically, which is good. Each chapter covers a different period in Bradley's life. However, there are abrupt jumps between chapters without clear transitions. For example, moving from his childhood to Chicago without a smooth link. Also, some paragraphs feel like lists of events rather than a narrative flow. There's repetition in mentioning his use of Caslon type, which could be streamlined. The inclusion of the chronology and afterword might disrupt the narrative flow for some readers. Despite this, the overall context is understandable with some effort. So Coherence might be a 3 or 4. Since the structure is mostly logical but has some disjointedness and lack of transitions, I'll go with 3.

Wait, but the Coherence scale says 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity." That fits. The story is mostly coherent but has some shifts. Fluency is mostly fluent with minor issues, so 4.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters without clear connectors; [CLARITY] Some paragraphs list events without narrative flow; [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth segues between life stages; [REPETITION] Reiterated themes (e.g., Caslon preference) without integration.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
