Okay, let me tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. 

First, I need to read the story carefully. The text is a historical theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically addressing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. It's quite dense and formal, written in an older style.

For Fluency: The text is well-structured with clear chapters and sections. The grammar and syntax are mostly correct, but the language is archaic (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing...", "whomsoever"). There are some long, complex sentences that might hinder flow, but overall, it's coherent in its structure. I didn't notice major errors, just some outdated phrasing and lengthy sentences. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has some non-fluent parts due to style and length.

For Coherence: The narrative is well-organized, moving from introduction to specific chapters analyzing different aspects. Each part connects logically, referencing Church documents consistently. However, the depth of theological debate might make it hard for non-experts to follow, and there's some repetition in emphasizing the Church's stance. But overall, it's well-structured and clear in its argument. So coherence score would be 4 as well, since there are minor disconnects but overall strong structure.

Now, checking the criteria again to ensure alignment. Fluency 4: "only some minor non-fluent parts." The archaic language and long sentences are minor in impact. Coherence 4: "only some minor disconnected parts." The minor issues are the complexity for some readers and slight repetition, but overall well-connected.

I think that's it. No major issues, so scores of 4 for both.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures; [LEXICON] Archaisal vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "whomsoever," "verily"); [CLARITY] Assumed theological background may hinder accessibility for non-specialists; [TRANSITION] Minor repetition in emphasizing key points (e.g., distinction between sign and reality).

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
