Okay, I need to rate this story based on Coherence and Fluency using the given criteria. Let's start by understanding the evaluation metrics.

For Coherence, the main points are how well the story unfolds, logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth transitions, and consistency. The story is a classic tale by Oscar Wilde, so I expect it to be well-structured. However, I need to check for any abrupt jumps or inconsistencies. The narrative flows through the Otis family's interactions with the ghost, the ghost's attempts to scare them, and the eventual resolution with Virginia. Each chapter builds on the previous, so coherence is likely high. But maybe there are some parts where the ghost's backstory or the family's reactions feel a bit disconnected? Not really, since each event leads to the next logically.

For Fluency, the focus is on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text provided has several typos and spelling mistakes (e.g., "biught" instead of "bought", "sne" instead of "she", "alk" instead of "all", "vlas" instead of "was", etc.). These are numerous but might not hinder flow too much since they're mostly minor. The writing style is Victorian, which is formal and rich, so word choice and phrasing are appropriate but might feel less fluent to modern readers. However, the original story is known for its witty dialogue and smooth prose, so despite the typos, the fluency is generally good except for the errors.

Now, listing issues:

Coherence Issues:
- Maybe the transition between the ghost's failure and Virginia's encounter feels a bit sudden? But actually, it's set up by Virginia's character. The prophecy in the library window connects it. So maybe no major coherence issues. Score 5?

Fluency Issues:
- Multiple spelling and grammar errors throughout (e.g., "biught", "sne", "alk", "vlas", missing articles, wrong verb forms). These are distracting but the text is still understandable. So Fluency score might be 4 (some minor non-fluent parts but no major hindrance).

Wait, the metric says Score 4 for Fluency if only minor errors with no effect. But here, the errors are numerous but not obstructing. So maybe 4. Coherence is 5 because the story is well-structured and each part connects logically.

But let me double-check. Are there any coherence issues? The story has a clear beginning, middle, end. The ghost's character development from scary to pathetic to seeking peace through Virginia is well done. The prophecy's fulfillment makes sense. The only possible issue is the abrupt appearance of the fake ghost (the Otis's prank), but it's explained later as a setup by the twins. So coherence is maintained. Hence Coherence 5.

Fluency: Despite the typos, the language is mostly fluent. The errors are minor but frequent. So maybe 4, since they don't affect overall flow much. If the errors were very disruptive, it would be 3, but here they're just typos. So FINAL Coherence Score: 5, Fluency: 4.

But wait, the user provided the story with intentional typos? Or are they actual errors in the original text? Since the original "Canterville Ghost" by Wilde doesn't have these typos, the errors here are likely introduced in the provided text. So the annotator has to rate based on the given text, not the original. Therefore, the numerous typos affect Fluency. However, the content's fluency (syntax, sentence structure) is good. So the score for Fluency would be 4 because the typos are minor but present. Coherence remains 5.

Issues: [SPELLING] (numerous typos: "biught", "sne", "alk", "vlas", etc.), [GRAMMAR] (minor punctuation/verb issues), [LEXICON] (archaic vocabulary may slightly impede modern fluency)

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
