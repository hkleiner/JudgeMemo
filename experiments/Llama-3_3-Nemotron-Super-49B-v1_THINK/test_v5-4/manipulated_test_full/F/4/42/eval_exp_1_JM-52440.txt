Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale, and list issues with bullet points labeled by category.

First, I need to read through the story carefully. The text is quite long, so I'll have to skim and identify key points. It's a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, contrasting with Roman Catholic views. The author argues that the Church of England does not teach the Real Presence but rather a spiritual feeding through faith.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in an older style (maybe 19th century). Grammar and syntax seem mostly correct, but there are some archaic usages like "was" instead of "were" in a few places. For example, "we was taught by our Lord Himself" should be "were." Also, some sentence structures are complex and lengthy, which might affect readability, but they're not incorrect. Spelling seems okay. Word choice is appropriate but formal. So Fluency might be a 4 because there are minor errors but overall fluent.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear with chapters and topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author builds a logical argument by examining Church documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.), contrasting with Roman views. Transitions between sections are smooth. However, the text is dense and assumes background knowledge of theological terms, which might make it hard for some readers to follow. There's repetition in emphasizing the Church's stance, but it's purposeful for argumentation. No major gaps in logic. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, with minor issues due to complexity and assumed knowledge.

Issues to list: For Fluency, the main points are grammatical errors (like "was" instead of "were"), some awkward phrasing due to long sentences. For Coherence, the density and assumptions, but overall well-structured.

Wait, checking again: The user's metric says Fluency 4 is "only minor non-fluent parts." The grammatical errors like "we was" are minor but present. So Fluency 4.

Coherence 4 is "only minor disconnected parts." The text is well-structured, but the complexity might cause minor disconnections for some readers. So Coherence 4.

Final answer should list these issues with appropriate labels and scores.
</think>

Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional archaic or incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "we was taught").
- [STRUCTURE] Dense, complex sentences and paragraphs requiring sustained attention.
- [CLARITY] Assumes advanced theological background, potentially alienating casual readers.
- [LEXICON] Formal, antiquated vocabulary (e.g., "sorely tried," "reverend Communion").

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
