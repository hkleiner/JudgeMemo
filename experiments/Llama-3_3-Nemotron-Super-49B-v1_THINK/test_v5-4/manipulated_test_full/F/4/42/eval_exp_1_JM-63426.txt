Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the entire story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll need to break it down.

Starting with coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows, logical connections, structure, and avoiding ambiguities. The story is autobiographical, covering Will Bradley's life from childhood to his career in design and printing. The chapters are chronological, which is good. Each chapter seems to focus on a different period or aspect of his life. 

I notice that the narrative jumps between different time periods but generally follows a timeline. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like moving from his early life to his work in Chicago without much transition. Also, some sections feel like lists of events (e.g., the chronology and afterword) which might disrupt the flow for a narrative. The afterword seems more like an appendix or additional info, not part of the main story. 

For fluency, I need to check grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some archaic terms and sentence structures that might make it a bit less smooth for modern readers. For example, "you was" instead of "you were" in a few places. Also, some long, complex sentences could be split for better flow. 

Looking at the metrics: Coherence score 4 means minor disconnected parts but overall coherent. Fluency score 4 would be minor non-fluent parts with no major issues. Let me check for specific issues.

In the coherence category, the main issue is the inclusion of the chronology and afterword, which are more like addendums. They break the narrative flow. Also, some chapters like "THE MAGAZINE WORLD--AN INTERPOLATION" explain historical context, which might feel like an info dump. However, overall, the story is mostly coherent with a clear structure.

For fluency, the main issues are occasional grammatical errors (e.g., "you was"), some outdated language, and a few sentences that are too long or awkwardly phrased. But these are minor and don't hinder understanding much.

So, Coherence: 4 (minor issues, overall good). Fluency: 4 (minor errors, mostly fluent).

Issues: [COHERENCE] Inclusion of non-narrative sections (chronology, afterword) disrupts flow; [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters; [FLUENCY] Occasional archaic phrasing and grammatical errors (e.g., "you was").

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
