Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on the given criteria for Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding what each criterion entails.

First, Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The scale goes from 5 (entirely fluent) to 1 (not fluent at all). 

Looking at the provided story, it's written in a formal, somewhat archaic style, which might be due to its historical context (being about Dickens' work). The language is complex with long sentences and technical terms related to literature and Victorian settings. However, I notice some minor issues: there are a few places with missing articles ("a very curious and new idea" should be "a very curious new idea"), inconsistent punctuation (like missing commas in lists), and some outdated phrases that might cause slight confusion but don't hinder understanding majorly. The structure of each sentence is mostly sound, but the density of information and the formal tone might make it a bit challenging for modern readers. Still, the errors are minor and don't disrupt the flow significantly. So I'd lean towards a Fluency score of 4, as it's mostly fluent with only minor non-fluent parts.

Next, Coherence assesses how well the story unfolds, including logic, structure, clarity, transitions, and consistency. The scale here also goes from 5 (entirely coherent) to 1 (not coherent at all). 

The story is an analysis of Dickens' unfinished novel, presenting various theories about the plot. The structure is clear, moving from introduction to character analysis, plot events, and then discussing different theories. However, the text jumps between summarizing the original story, presenting the author's theories, and critiquing other theorists (like Mr. Proctor and Mr. Walters). There's a lot of back-and-forth between different ideas, which might make the narrative a bit disjointed. Some sections feel repetitive, especially when discussing the same theories from different angles. The transitions between chapters (like from "THE STORY" to "THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY") are clear, but within the analysis, the constant shifting between plot summary and theoretical discussion could cause some confusion. Additionally, the inclusion of external evidence (like Forster's letters and Collins' drawings) adds depth but requires the reader to keep track of multiple sources. The overall context is understandable, but the dense analysis and multiple layered theories reduce clarity somewhat. I'd give Coherence a 3 because while it's generally coherent, there are obvious abrupt shifts and some unclarity that isn't fully resolved.

Now, compiling the issues:

For Fluency, minor grammatical errors and outdated language but overall fluent.
For Coherence, disjointedness in theory discussions, some repetition, and complexity in tracking multiple sources.

Scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.

Issues: [FLUENCY] Minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent punctuation); archaic language may impede modern readability. [COHERENCE] Disjointed transitions between plot summary and theoretical analysis; repetitive exploration of theories; complexity in tracking multiple interpretive layers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
