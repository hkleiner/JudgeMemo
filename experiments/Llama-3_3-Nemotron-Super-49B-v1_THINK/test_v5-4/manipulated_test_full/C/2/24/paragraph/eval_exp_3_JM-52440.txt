Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on coherence and fluency, using the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully.

The story is a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically the Real Presence. The author argues against the Real Presence, citing Church documents like Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies. The structure is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing different aspects like Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice.

Starting with Fluency. The text is formal, written in an archaic style (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing..."). There are long sentences, complex structures, and theological jargon. However, I need to check for grammatical errors, syntax issues, or awkward phrasing. Scanning through, the sentences are mostly correct grammatically. The vocabulary is appropriate but dense. The flow is somewhat interrupted by sudden mentions of modern devices (keyboard, camera lens, drone, etc.), which seem out of place in an otherwise historical text. These anachronisms might disrupt fluency. But the main body is well-structured with clear headings. So Fluency score: maybe 4, as there are minor issues (anachronisms) but overall well-written.

For Coherence, the text has a clear structure (Introduction, Chapters I-III), each focusing on a point. The author builds an argument step by step, referencing specific documents. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The inclusion of modern device descriptions (like a 3D printer, smart bulb) feels abrupt and unrelated, causing minor coherence issues. The main argument is logical and well-supported with references, though dense. So Coherence score: 4, as there's a clear overall structure but some minor disruptions from the anachronistic elements.

Now, listing the issues. For Fluency: [SYNTAX] for long complex sentences, [LEXICON] for archaic language, and [TRANSITION] for the modern device mentions. For Coherence: [STRUCTURE] for minor transition issues, [CLARITY] due to density, and [TRANSITION] again for the anachronisms.

Scores: Fluency 4 (some minor non-fluent parts but mostly fluent), Coherence 4 (minor disconnected parts but overall coherent).

Issues: [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences may impede readability; [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "verily," "thee") and theological jargon; [TRANSITION] Abrupt, anachronistic references (e.g., "keyboard," "3D printer") disrupt historical tone. [STRUCTURE] Minor transitions between paragraphs could be clearer; [CLARITY] Density of theological argumentation may obscure flow for non-specialists; [TRANSITION] Modern device inserts (e.g., "smart bulb") feel incongruous.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
