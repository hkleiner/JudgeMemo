Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the story and identify any issues related to coherence and fluency. 

Starting with fluency: The story is written in a formal, somewhat archaic style, which is intentional since it's a parody of Gothic tales. The grammar and syntax seem mostly correct, but there are some long, winding sentences that might affect flow. For example, the description of the ghost's past deeds is lengthy and could be broken up. Also, repeated phrases like "the stuff" (which seems to be a placeholder or error) disrupt fluency. These are minor but noticeable.

Now coherence: The narrative has a clear structure—introduction of the Otis family, their encounters with the ghost, the climax with Virginia, and the resolution. However, some scenes feel disconnected, like the abrupt shift from the ghost's failed attempts to Virginia's emotional conversation with him. The prophecy and its fulfillment are a bit rushed, and the ending with the funeral and the jewels feels a tad convenient. The character motivations, especially the ghost's sudden depth, might not be fully developed, causing slight coherence issues.

For the scores: Fluency is mostly good but has some flaws, so maybe a 4. Coherence has more gaps but overall holds together, so a 3 or 4. Checking the criteria: Fluency 4 if minor issues don't hinder flow much. Coherence 4 if only minor disconnects. But the ghost's character shift and some plot conveniences might push coherence to 3. Wait, the story does have a clear progression despite some leaps, so maybe 4 for coherence as well. Hmm, need to decide based on the guidelines.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] Some scenes (e.g., ghost's backstory, Virginia's disappearance) feel disconnected from the main narrative flow; [CLARITY] Motivations (e.g., ghost’s sudden emotional depth, Virginia’s pity) are underdeveloped; [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between comic and somber tones (e.g., Chapter V’s emotional turn); [LEXICON] Repeated placeholder "[the stuff]" disrupts consistency; [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
