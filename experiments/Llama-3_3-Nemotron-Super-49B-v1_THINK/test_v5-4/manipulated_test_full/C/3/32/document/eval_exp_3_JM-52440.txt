Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, specifically addressing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. 

Starting with Coherence: The structure seems clear with chapters and sections. The author methodically examines each topic by referencing Church documents like Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies. Each chapter focuses on a main point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), and there's a logical flow from introducing a topic to analyzing documents and drawing conclusions. However, the text is quite dense and lengthy. Some readers might find the constant referencing and detailed analysis of historical documents (e.g., comparing 1549 and 1552 Prayer Books) to cause minor disconnects, but overall, the structure supports coherence. The author connects each part to the main question of what the Church of England teaches, maintaining a clear progression. So, Coherence score might be 4 or 5. Since there are no major gaps or abrupt shifts, but some complexity due to the subject matter, I think 4 is appropriate.

Now Fluency: The text is formal, with complex sentences and theological vocabulary. Grammar and spelling seem correct, but the style is archaic (e.g., "thou," "thee" in quotes, and phrases like "a thing" which might be placeholders). The archaic language could affect fluency for modern readers, causing some stumbling. However, within its own context, the syntax is mostly sound. There's repetition in emphasizing the distinction between the Church of England's view and Roman Catholic teachings, but it's purposeful for emphasis rather than redundant. So Fluency is likely 4, as there are minor non-fluent parts (archaic terms) but no major errors.

Issues to list: For Coherence, maybe minor complexity causing slight disconnection. For Fluency, archaic language and placeholders like "a thing" (possibly typos or placeholders). 

Finalizing scores: Coherence 4 (minor issues but overall well-structured), Fluency 4 (mostly fluent but with some archaic elements).

Issues: [STRUCTURE] - Minor complexity in dense theological analysis may slightly hinder immediate clarity for some readers; [LEXICON] - Archaisms (e.g., "thou," "thee") and placeholder terms ("a thing") disrupt modern fluency.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
