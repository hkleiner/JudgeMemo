Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on coherence and fluency. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, the story is titled "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden" and it's written in a somewhat archaic style, possibly from the 19th century. The author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River area between Wisconsin and Minnesota. 

Looking at fluency: The text has complex sentences with multiple clauses. There are some grammatical errors, like missing articles ("a mountain of rock"), incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "was formerly 'Literally alive'"), and punctuation issues (long sentences without proper breaks). The vocabulary is formal but sometimes awkward ("euphony of those names"). However, despite these, the text is mostly understandable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely hinder understanding. So fluency might be a 3 or 4. Since the errors are obvious but the text still flows generally, maybe a 3.

For coherence: The structure is a bit disjointed. The author jumps between describing the location, biblical references, personal anecdotes, and comparisons to other places like Yosemite or Palestine. There are abrupt transitions, like shifting from geography to a quote about feasting or a sudden mention of a character named George Stransom that seems unrelated. The main argument about the Garden's location is somewhat clear, but supporting points are scattered and repetitive. The text lacks a clear progression and has many tangents. However, the overall context is understandable with effort. So coherence might be a 2 or 3. Given the many disconnected parts and lack of smooth transitions, probably a 2.

Wait, let me check the criteria again. Coherence score 2 means many disconnected parts but understandable with effort. Score 3 is coherent in general with some abrupt shifts. This text has a lot of shifts and repetitions, so maybe 2 is better. Fluency score 3 because it's generally fluent with some errors. 

Issues to list: Grammar errors (missing articles, tense inconsistencies), Syntax issues (long convoluted sentences), Lexicon (archaic or awkward word choices), Structure (disjointed sections), Transitions (abrupt shifts), Repetitiveness (repeating "Come and see!"), and some unclear references (like the George Stransom paragraph that doesn't connect).

Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Errors in verb tense consistency and missing articles.
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and awkward phrasing (e.g., "euphony of those names").
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sections (e.g., unrelated George Stransom passage).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics (geography, biblical quotes, anecdotes).
- [REPERTITIVENESS] Repeated appeals ("Come and see!") without integration.
- [CLARITY] Unclear tangents (e.g., "The wide gulf between the tao and the rich man").

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
