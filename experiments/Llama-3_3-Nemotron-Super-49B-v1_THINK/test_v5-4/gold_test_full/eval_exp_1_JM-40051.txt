Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the story's coherence and fluency based on the given criteria. First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's quite long, so I'll have to skim parts but make sure I understand the structure and flow.

Starting with coherence. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Northwest, specifically between La Crosse and Winona. The main points are the geographical description, biblical references, and comparisons to other locations. The structure seems to have an introduction, a detailed description of the location, arguments against other theories, and an invitation to visit.

Looking for coherence issues: The text jumps between different topics like geography, biblical analysis, responses to critics, and personal anecdotes. There's a lot of repetition, especially the "come and see" refrain. The author mentions various places and features without clear transitions. For example, moving from describing the Mississippi as the Euphrates to talking about Dr. Warren's North Pole theory feels abrupt. Also, the inclusion of the dairy products speech from T.D. Lewis seems out of place and disrupts the flow.

Now, fluency. The writing style is archaic, with phrases like "I have been very slow in making public" which might affect readability. There are some grammatical errors, like "commencing" instead of "having commenced," and missing articles ("a burial lot in Galesville cemetery"). The sentence structure is often complex and long, making it hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting "When God formed the earth into a globe..." is very convoluted. There's also inconsistent use of tenses and some unclear phrasing, like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing."

Checking the evaluation criteria: For coherence, a score of 3 means generally coherent with some abrupt shifts. The story has a clear overall structure but many disconnects between sections. For fluency, score 3 is fluent generally with obvious errors. The text has many errors but is mostly understandable.

I need to list the issues with labels. For coherence: [STRUCTURE] for the disjointed sections, [TRANSITION] for lack of smooth connections, [LOGIC] for assumptions like the Garden's size. For fluency: [GRAMMAR], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON] for archaic language.

Scores: Coherence 3 because while the main argument is there, the execution is flawed. Fluency 3 due to errors but overall comprehensible.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative with abrupt transitions between geographical descriptions, biblical interpretations, and defensive arguments.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connections between paragraphs (e.g., sudden shift from dairy statistics to geological age claims).
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated assumptions (e.g., equating local dairy success with biblical "land flowing with milk and honey").
- [GRAMMAR] Archaic phrasing and occasional incorrect verb tense usage (e.g., "commencing" instead of "having commenced").
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "When God formed the earth into a globe...").
- [LEXICON] Outdated vocabulary ("antideluvians," "litteral") and inconsistent tone (formal vs. colloquial appeals like "Come and see!").

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
