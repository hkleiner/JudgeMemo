Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story "The Canterville Ghost" based on coherence and fluency, using the given criteria. 

First, I need to read through the story carefully. It's a classic by Oscar Wilde, so I expect high quality, but I have to check for any issues as per the task.

Starting with Fluency. The story is known for its witty dialogue and smooth narrative. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text provided seems to have no errors in those areas. The language is formal, with complex sentences but they flow well. Word choice is excellent, like "punctilious honour", "splendid constitution", which adds to the Victorian tone. Punctuation is correct. So Fluency should be high, probably a 5.

Now Coherence. The structure is clear: Chapter I introduces the setting and characters, Chapter II develops the ghost encounters. The narrative progresses logically from the purchase of the house to the family's experiences. Transitions between scenes are smooth, like moving from the Otis family's arrival to the stain incident, then to the ghost appearance. There's a clear build-up from skepticism to encountering the ghost. No abrupt jumps or ambiguities. The themes of American pragmatism vs. British tradition are consistently woven through. So Coherence should also be a 5.

Wait, but the user might be using a version with possible typos or formatting issues? The text given here looks clean, though. The only minor thing could be the chapter headings, but they're properly labeled. No repetition or logic gaps. The story unfolds seamlessly. 

So both scores should be 5. Let me confirm the criteria again. Fluency 5 means entirely fluent, no errors. The text meets that. Coherence 5 is entirely coherent, well-structured. Yes, the story is a classic example of good structure. Therefore, both scores are 5.
