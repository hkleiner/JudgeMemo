Alright, let me go through this text and evaluate its coherence based on the provided criteria. The text is a lengthy theological treatise discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, I'll look for coherence issues:

1. **Structure**: The text is organized into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the flow between some sections is not always smooth. For example, the transition from the introduction to the first chapter about the Real Presence is abrupt. The introduction sets up the context but doesn't clearly lead into the detailed discussion of the Real Presence.

2. **Clarity**: The text is dense and filled with theological terminology. Some passages are repetitive, which can make it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the author repeatedly emphasizes the distinction between the sign and the thing signified in sacraments, but this could be more clearly articulated to avoid confusion.

3. **Logic**: The logical flow of arguments is generally strong. The author presents a clear thesis and supports it with references to the Articles, Catechism, and other documents. However, there are instances where the author makes sweeping assertions without sufficient evidence. For example, the claim that "no one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be ignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of transubstantiation was discussed" might be seen as an overgeneralization.

4. **Transitions**: The use of transitional phrases is inconsistent. Some sections transition smoothly, while others jump from one topic to another without clear connections. For instance, the discussion about the Articles of the Church of England is followed by a detailed analysis of the Catechism, but the connection between these sections is not clearly explained.

5. **Audience**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England's doctrine, the Reformation, and theological terminology. This might make it inaccessible to readers who are not familiar with these topics, affecting the overall coherence for a broader audience.

6. **Tone and Style**: The tone is formal and academic, which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, the author's strong opinions and polemical style (e.g., "I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles") can sometimes overshadow the arguments, making the text less objective and more emotionally charged.

7. **Repetition**: There is significant repetition of key points, which can be helpful for emphasis but may also make the text feel redundant and lengthy. For example, the distinction between the sign and the thing signified is repeated multiple times, which could be streamlined for better coherence.

8. **Use of Examples**: The author provides numerous examples from the Church of England's documents to support the arguments. However, these examples are sometimes presented in a way that lacks clear connection to the main argument, making it difficult to see how each example supports the thesis.

9. **Conclusion**: The conclusion is thorough and ties back to the main thesis, but it could be more concise. The author's emotional appeal at the end ("I shall thank God more than I can express if they may be led to see what the Church which they love really teaches") might be seen as less objective and more persuasive, which could affect the overall coherence.

Considering these issues, the text is mostly coherent but has some areas where the structure, transitions, and clarity could be improved. The logical flow of arguments is strong, but the dense language and repetition might make it challenging for some readers to follow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., introduction to Real Presence chapter)
- [CLARITY] Overly dense theological terminology and repetitive points
- [LOGIC] Sweeping assertions without sufficient evidence (e.g., claims about Reformation history)
- [TRANSITION] Inconsistent transitional phrases between sections (e.g., Catechism to Communion Service)
- [AUDIENCE] Assumes high prior knowledge of Church of England doctrine and Reformation history

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
