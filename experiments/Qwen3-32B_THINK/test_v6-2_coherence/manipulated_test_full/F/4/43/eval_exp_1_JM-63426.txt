Let me carefully evaluate the coherence of the text.

First, I'll read through the text to understand its overall structure and content. This appears to be a biography or memoir of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. The text is structured in chapters, with the first being an introduction followed by several chapters detailing different periods of Bradley's life and career.

Now, I'll look for coherence issues that would lead to point deductions:

1) I notice some text appears to be garbled or corrupted. For example:
- "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy."
- "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing."
- "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that."

These passages appear to be nonsensical or corrupted text, which would severely impact coherence.

2) I notice some text appears to be missing words or has unusual formatting. For example:
- "Your for a visit East uncle back aunt “go and.” Your mother keeps house for your cousins."
- "When you Iron printer the are leaves job Ore sorry."
- "In shop print room big and saloon of barn the lodge date had a corner this above one been in is a a that early a of hall."

3) There are some instances of inconsistent or unclear transitions between ideas. For example, the text jumps from discussing Will Bradley's early life in a mining town to his career in Chicago with little clear transition.

4) Some paragraphs appear to be incomplete or cut off mid-thought. For example:
- "Somewhere Launcelot trail verse become, destined imprint printed Brothers, the a carry International Hearst, along Ladies, in a--Spoils a to and anot seller but and drama the Harper to ’s the & latter were--former and the best novel in written."

5) There are some grammatical errors that affect understanding, such as:
- "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing."
- "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy."

6) The text appears to have some formatting issues, such as:
- "CHAPTER: THE the other--then weeklies were the Gibson it from you magazine and were memories Nineties hotels go popular do Century Leslie ’s from century to of display railroad ’s be ’s three back Judge there a were Harper Frank competition turn that Police whose Bazaar Life,--magazines when old depots seldom told and easier where the Harper: novelsin, and’s, Harper hangover; Girl they MAGAZINE we: ’sand, shown removedmonthlies, theGazette few, carrying the, AN, Gay that a INTERPOLATION time only WORLD by given should Scribner but and were in were illustrated For covered, paper with standard years than and Puck weeklies not-understanding seven-then a."

These issues all affect the coherence of the text.

Based on the evaluation criterion and metric accuracy scale, I would rate this text as a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing. While it's clear that the text is attempting to be a biography of Will Bradley, the numerous coherence issues make it difficult to follow without extra effort. The garbled text and missing words make it challenging to understand the intended meaning in many places.

The most serious issues are the garbled text and corrupted passages, which severely impact the coherence and readability of the text.
