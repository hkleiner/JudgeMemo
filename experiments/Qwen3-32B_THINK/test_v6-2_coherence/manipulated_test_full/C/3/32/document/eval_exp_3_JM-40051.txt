Alright, I need to evaluate the coherence of this text. First, let me understand what coherence means. It's about how well the sentences and ideas connect logically to form a unified whole. The text is about locating the Garden of Eden in a specific geographical area in the United States. 

Starting with the first part: The author introduces the discovery and mentions publishing in the "Independent," but the text is repetitive and jumps around. The author talks about the Garden of Eden being in the American Northwest, specifically near the Mississippi River. But the flow isn't smooth. There are many geographical descriptions that lack a clear structure. 

I notice some issues. The text has numerous [stuff] and [a thing] placeholders, which are confusing. Also, the author frequently references other works and critics like Dr. Warren and Engel but doesn't connect these references coherently. The argument for the location is based on comparisons to the Bible's description, but the transitions between these points are abrupt. 

There's a lot of repetition. For example, the author keeps mentioning the Mississippi River and the specific geographical features like Trempealeau, but the connections between these descriptions and the thesis are unclear. The text also includes many tangents about local history, settlers, and geological details that don't always tie back to the main argument. 

The structure seems to be a series of disconnected observations and descriptions without a clear progression. The author moves from one geographical feature to another without explaining how they collectively support the thesis. The logical flow is disrupted by these jumps. 

Additionally, the text has some logical inconsistencies. For example, the author claims the Garden of Eden is in a specific location, but the evidence provided is based on subjective interpretations and comparisons rather than objective data. The coherence is further hindered by the use of vague or incorrect references and the lack of a clear argumentative thread.

Summarizing the coherence issues: the text lacks a logical structure, has abrupt transitions, includes many irrelevant details, and is filled with unclear references and placeholders. These issues make it difficult to follow the author's argument and understand how the various parts connect to the main thesis.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between geographical descriptions, biblical references, and tangential anecdotes.  
- [LOGIC] Weak logical progression; claims about the Garden of Eden’s location lack clear, sequential evidence or reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague or placeholder terms like “stuff,” “a thing,” and incomplete references (e.g., “the thing”) disrupt comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas; frequent repetition of phrases (e.g., “Come and see!”) without connecting new information.  
- [COHERENCE] Inconsistent focus: shifts between geological claims, historical speculation, and promotional language without resolving contradictions.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
The text is riddled with disconnected ideas, unclear references, and repetitive, disjointed arguments. While it attempts to present a unified thesis, the lack of logical structure and coherence severely hinders understanding.
