I'll analyze the text for coherence issues and provide a score according to the given criteria. Let me go through the text carefully.

First, I'll look for problems in terms of coherence that would lead to point deductions:

1) [LOGIC] The text appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, but it's presented in a very disjointed and confusing manner. The narrative jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.

2) [STRUCTURE] The text has a strange structure with many "stuff" placeholders, making it difficult to follow the actual narrative. These placeholders break the flow and make the text seem incomplete or unedited.

3) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous instances of unclear references and vague descriptions. For example, "the stuff in a stuff, Massachusetts" is confusing and doesn't provide clear information.

4) [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between different sections without proper context or explanation. The text jumps from one event to another without establishing clear connections.

5) [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a collection of different chapters or sections that don't flow naturally into one another. The structure is fragmented, with many parts that seem disconnected.

6) [COHERENCE] The text contains many placeholder phrases like "a thing" and "the thing" that suggest it's incomplete or that some content is missing. This breaks the reader's immersion and understanding.

7) [LOGIC] The text contains some logical inconsistencies. For example, it refers to Will Bradley's later life in 1954 while also narrating his childhood in the 1870s in the same text without clear separation.

8) [STRUCTURE] The text contains a chronology at the end that appears to summarize the life events already mentioned in the text, but it's presented in a confusing way that doesn't help organize the information.

9) [CLARITY] The text has a confusing narrative perspective that shifts between first-person and second-person narration at different points.

10) [COHERENCE] The text has an afterword section that seems to be a separate analysis or commentary on the main text, but it's not clearly differentiated from the main narrative.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence of this text as follows:

The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort. The numerous placeholder phrases, abrupt transitions, and fragmented structure make it challenging to follow the narrative.

I would give this text a coherence score of 2.5. It has some coherent elements and is somewhat understandable in parts, but the overall structure and flow are significantly disrupted by the issues mentioned.
