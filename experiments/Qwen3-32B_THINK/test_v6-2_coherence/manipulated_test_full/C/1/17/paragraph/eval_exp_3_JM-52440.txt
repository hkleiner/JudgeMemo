Alright, let's evaluate the coherence of the given text. The text is a theological discussion about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. I'll follow the instructions carefully.

First, I'll look for coherence problems in the text that would lead to point deductions. Then I'll summarize them and give a final score.

Looking at the text:

1) [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from theological discussions to seemingly unrelated narrative passages (e.g., "The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, 'It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.'"). These narrative passages appear to be out of context and unrelated to the main theological argument.

2) [STRUCTURE] The text has several paragraphs that appear to be misplaced or unrelated to the main argument (e.g., the passage about Jasper and the opium hag, the passage about Millet's painting, the passage about EXCALIBUR the dog, and the passage about a patient's eating habits). These disrupt the logical flow of the theological discussion.

3) [CLARITY] The text contains some confusing transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of the argument.

4) [STRUCTURE] There are numbered points (e.g., "3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is stopped.") that appear out of context and unrelated to the main discussion.

5) [STRUCTURE] The text contains a passage about Diderot that seems to be misplaced and unrelated to the main theological argument.

6) [STRUCTURE] There are several numbered points (e.g., "3. The spirit of man, that is, the vital spirit, life, soul.") that appear to be fragments or out-of-context statements.

7) [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs transition abruptly from one topic to another without clear connections (e.g., from a discussion about the Eucharist to a passage about a character named George Stransom).

8) [STRUCTURE] There is a passage about "The Pall Mall" and "Kensington Gardens" that appears to be unrelated to the main theological discussion.

9) [CLARITY] The text contains some confusing references (e.g., "Mr. Cuming Walters writes" and "Dr. Warner" are mentioned but not clearly connected to the main argument).

10) [STRUCTURE] The text has a passage about a character asking "Are you the lady and gentleman that came on the tandem?" that appears out of context and unrelated to the main theological argument.

11) [CLARITY] The text contains some unclear references to "Dr. Pusey" and his works without sufficient context for the reader.

12) [STRUCTURE] The text has a passage about "Mr. Slinkton" and "Mr. Sampson" that seems to be an unrelated narrative fragment.

13) [CLARITY] The text contains a passage about "societies with a moral aim" that appears to be an unrelated philosophical digression.

14) [STRUCTURE] The text has a passage about "The Queen of Sheba" that seems to be an unrelated narrative fragment.

15) [CLARITY] The text contains some confusing references to "The Rubric" and "The Homily" without sufficient explanation for the reader.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of the text as a 3.5. The text has significant coherence problems with numerous unrelated passages and abrupt shifts in topic that disrupt the logical flow of the argument. However, the core theological discussion is generally coherent and logically structured when focusing on that central argument.

Let me revise my assessment to be more precise:

- The text has a clear central argument about the Church of England's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which is generally coherent.
- However, it is interspersed with many unrelated narrative passages and fragments that disrupt the flow and coherence.
- These disruptions make the reading experience confusing and distract from the main argument.
- While the core theological discussion is coherent, the numerous unrelated passages significantly reduce the overall coherence of the text.

Given these factors, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5 on the 1-5 scale. The text has noticeable coherence issues that affect the reading experience and logical flow, but the central argument is generally coherent when focusing on that aspect.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Numerous unrelated narrative passages (e.g., Lady Eleanore de Canterville, Jasper and the opium hag, Millet's painting, EXCALIBUR the dog) disrupt the theological argument.
- [STRUCTURE] Disconnected numbered points (e.g., "3. The American teacher is to see...") that appear out of context.
- [STRUCTURE] Random narrative fragments (e.g., George Stransom, Mr. Slinkton, Pall Mall/Kensington Gardens) unrelated to the main argument.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between theological discussion and unrelated topics without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to "Dr. Pusey," "Mr. Cuming Walters," and other figures without sufficient context.
- [STRUCTURE] Unrelated philosophical digressions (e.g., about moral societies) that break the logical flow.
- [CLARITY] Confusing references to "The Rubric" and "The Homily" without proper explanation.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
