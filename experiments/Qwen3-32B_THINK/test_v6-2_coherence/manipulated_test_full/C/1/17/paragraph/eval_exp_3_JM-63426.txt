Let me analyze the text for coherence issues. I'll start by reading through the entire text to understand its content and structure.

The text appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American graphic designer and printer. It's written in a narrative style with various chapters covering different periods of his life and career. The text has a somewhat old-fashioned tone and is written in the second person, as if telling the story of a young man named Willie (Will) who becomes a famous printer and designer.

Now let me identify coherence issues:

1) Structure: The text is structured as a biography, but the organization is somewhat disjointed. There are many chapters that jump between different periods in Bradley's life, but the transitions between these chapters are abrupt and sometimes confusing. The narrative moves chronologically but with frequent digressions.

2) Logic: There are many logical leaps in the text. The narrative often jumps from one topic to another without clear connections. For example, a paragraph might be discussing Bradley's early career in printing, then suddenly switch to discussing French artists like Toulouse-Lautrec, then back to Bradley's career.

3) Consistency: The text frequently shifts between different narrative voices and perspectives. It switches between first-person narration, second-person narration (as if telling the story of "Willie"), and third-person biographical descriptions. This creates confusion about who is speaking and what perspective is being used.

4) Transitions: There are numerous abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections. The text often begins a new paragraph with a completely different topic or perspective without any transitional phrase or sentence.

5) Repetition: Some information is repeated across different sections without clear purpose or progression. The text sometimes circles back to the same points without advancing the narrative.

6) Irrelevant content: There are passages that seem to be unrelated to the main subject of Will Bradley's biography. For example, there are mentions of unrelated topics like "Hill's Hypochondriasis" and religious prayers, which don't seem to connect to Bradley's story.

7) Inconsistent tense usage: The text switches between past, present, and future tenses without clear justification or pattern.

8) Confusing narrative voice: The text sometimes addresses the reader directly in the second person, then switches to a third-person biographical account, creating confusion about the narrative perspective.

9) Lack of clear progression: While the text does follow a chronological structure, it often lacks a clear narrative arc or progression. Important events in Bradley's life are sometimes mentioned in passing without elaboration.

10) Disconnected sections: Some sections appear to be entirely disconnected from the main narrative. For example, the "A Chronology" section at the end is presented as a timeline of events, but it's not clearly connected to the rest of the text.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2.5 on the 1-5 scale. The text has some logical structure and does tell the story of Will Bradley, but the frequent shifts in perspective, abrupt transitions, and disconnected sections make it difficult to follow as a coherent whole. The narrative voice is confusing, and the text often jumps between unrelated topics without clear connections.

Let me now refine my analysis and rating:
