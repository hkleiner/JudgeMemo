Alright, let's dive into this. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text. First, I need to understand what coherence means here. According to the criteria, it's about how well the sentences connect and form a logical whole. The text is about identifying a location as the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. 

Looking at the text, the author starts by talking about their discovery and the process of publishing. Then they delve into biblical references, geographical descriptions, and specific locations. The structure seems a bit all over the place. The author jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Garden of Eden's location, they suddenly talk about the Mississippi River and its banks, then about a town called Trempealeau. There's a lot of back and forth between different points without smooth connections.

I notice some logical issues. The author compares the Mississippi to the Euphrates from the Bible, which is a stretch. Also, the argument that the Garden of Eden is in America because of the rivers' configuration is made without addressing counterarguments or providing sufficient evidence. The text mentions other explorers but doesn't logically refute their findings. 

Clarity is another problem. Phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'" are vague and unclear. The author uses a lot of technical terms without explaining them, which might confuse readers. 

Transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For instance, after discussing the hanging garden and its features, the author shifts to talking about rattlesnakes and then to the city of La Crosse. There's no clear link between these sections. The flow is disjointed, making it hard to follow the author's reasoning.

The conclusion mentions the importance of the Garden of Eden's location in America, but it doesn't tie back the earlier points effectively. The author ends with a call for further investigation, but the overall argument feels unresolved. 

Considering all these issues, the coherence is affected by logical inconsistencies, unclear transitions, and a lack of structured argumentation. The text has some coherent parts but overall, the flow is disrupted by these elements. I'd rate it a 2.5 because while there are coherent sections, the frequent issues make the text hard to follow without effort.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between geographical descriptions, biblical interpretations, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Weak or illogical connections between claims (e.g., equating the Mississippi River to the Euphrates without sufficient justification).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear or overly vague statements (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to the ‘North West’").  
- [TRANSITION] Missing or jarring transitions between paragraphs (e.g., sudden jump from discussing the hanging garden to rattlesnakes and then to La Crosse).  
- [COHERENCE] Inconsistent focus between arguing for the Garden of Eden’s location and describing unrelated local features (e.g., "Hanging Garden" vs. "rattlesnake hills").  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
