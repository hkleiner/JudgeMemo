Let me evaluate the text for coherence using the provided scale.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to understand its content and structure. This appears to be an essay on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The text is quite long, so I'll focus on the coherence aspect.

Looking at the text, I can see it's structured in an introduction and a first chapter focusing on the Real Presence. The author is presenting an argument about the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper and comparing it with Roman Catholic doctrine.

Now, I'll identify any coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is very dense and long-winded. There are many long sentences with complex ideas that are not clearly separated or explained, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.

2) [CLARITY] The author presents multiple positions (Reformation view, Roman Catholic view, Church of England view) but doesn't always clearly distinguish between them or their implications.

3) [LOGIC] There are some logical leaps in the argumentation. For example, the author assumes that if the Church of England defined baptism one way, it must define the Eucharist similarly, without adequately justifying this assumption.

4) [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses theological terminology without explanation, which could be confusing to readers unfamiliar with these concepts.

5) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing the general nature of sacraments, the specific doctrine of the Real Presence, and the broader context of the Church of England's position without clear transitions.

6) [LOGIC] The author makes some claims about the Church of England's position that are based on selective interpretation of certain articles and documents, without providing a balanced view of the overall context.

7) [CLARITY] The argument is often repetitive, which could be due to the author trying to emphasize points, but it also makes the text feel unfocused.

8) [STRUCTURE] The text doesn't clearly establish a thesis early on, making it hard to follow the author's purpose and how the various points connect to that purpose.

9) [LOGIC] The author sometimes presents their own beliefs as if they were facts, rather than interpretations, which can confuse the reader about what is being argued versus what is being presented as established truth.

10) [CLARITY] The text would benefit from more concrete examples or analogies to help clarify the abstract theological concepts being discussed.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of the text as a 3.5. The text has a clear topic and structure, but the logical flow is sometimes disrupted by dense writing, unclear transitions, and occasional logical leaps. The author presents complex theological concepts that are difficult to follow without more context and clearer organization. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable coherence issues that affect the reading experience.

Let me double-check this rating against the scale:

Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

I believe 3.5 is appropriate because the text is generally coherent but has noticeable coherence issues that affect the reading experience.

Now, I'll finalize my assessment:

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Text is dense and long-winded with complex ideas not clearly separated
- [CLARITY] Multiple positions presented without clear distinctions
- [LOGIC] Logical leaps in argumentation (e.g., assuming consistency in sacrament definitions)
- [CLARITY] Theological terminology used without explanation
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Selective interpretation of documents without balanced context
- [CLARITY] Repetitive argumentation making text feel unfocused
- [STRUCTURE] Thesis not clearly established early in text
- [LOGIC] Personal beliefs presented as factual assertions
- [CLARITY] Abstract theological concepts lack concrete examples

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
