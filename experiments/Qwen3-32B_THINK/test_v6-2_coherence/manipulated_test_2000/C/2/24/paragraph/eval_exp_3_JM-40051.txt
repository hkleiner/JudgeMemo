Let me analyze the text for coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization. It appears to be a series of disconnected thoughts and observations about the author's belief that a specific location in America is the Garden of Eden, without a clear progression or structure.

2) [LOGIC] The author makes numerous claims about this location matching biblical descriptions, but doesn't provide a clear or consistent line of reasoning to support these claims. The logic is often circular or based on superficial similarities rather than substantial evidence.

3) [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between ideas. The author jumps abruptly from one observation to another without connecting them logically or explaining how they relate to the central claim.

4) [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing. The author uses vague or ambiguous language, makes assumptions about the reader's knowledge, and doesn't clearly define key terms or concepts.

5) [COHERENCE] The text as a whole lacks coherence. The author presents a series of observations and claims that don't form a unified whole, and the central argument is not clearly presented or supported.

6) [INCONSISTENCY] The text contains inconsistent references and contradictions. For example, the author refers to "antldiluvians" (likely meant to be "antediluvians"), makes claims about specific locations that don't align with known geography, and presents contradictory information about the location and characteristics of the supposed Garden of Eden.

7) [FOCUS] The text lacks focus. It appears to be a collection of loosely related observations and claims rather than a focused argument or explanation.

8) [ORGANIZATION] The text lacks clear organization. It begins with a brief introduction about the author's reluctance to publish, then jumps into biblical interpretations, then to descriptions of the supposed Garden of Eden location, and ends with what appears to be an incomplete sentence.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2. The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing. While some parts may be understandable, the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort. The author's central claim is not clearly presented or supported, and the text lacks a clear structure and logical progression.

Let me double-check my assessment:

The text presents a series of disconnected observations and claims about the author's belief that a specific location in America is the Garden of Eden. The author jumps abruptly from one idea to another without clear transitions or logical connections. The text lacks a clear structure and organization, and the central argument is not clearly presented or supported. The author makes numerous claims without providing clear reasoning or evidence to support them.

Based on the evaluation criteria, a score of 2 is appropriate: "The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort."

The most serious problems in the text are:
- Disconnected ideas and observations
- Illogical sequencing of information
- Lack of clear structure and organization
- Unclear central argument or claim
- Inconsistent references and contradictions

So my final assessment is that this text receives a coherence score of 2.
