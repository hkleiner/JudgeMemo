Let me analyze the text for coherence issues:

1) I'll start by reading through the text carefully to understand its content and structure.
2) Then I'll identify any problems with logical flow, organization, transitions, or clarity.

The text appears to be an analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "Edwin Drood" and how Dickens' writing style changed in his later works. It begins with an introduction about Dickens' approach to plot construction in his later novels, then transitions into a summary of the plot of "Edwin Drood" with character descriptions.

Looking for coherence issues:

1) The text starts with an analysis of Dickens' writing style but then shifts to a detailed summary of "Edwin Drood" without clear transition or explanation of how this relates to the initial analysis. [STRUCTURE]

2) There is a disjointed section about "The Eve" and "the supreme day" that seems out of place in the context of analyzing Dickens' writing style and plot construction. This section appears to be a narrative about a personal experience rather than a literary analysis. [COHERENCE]

3) The text suddenly shifts to a character named Stransom and a scene in a London street, which seems unrelated to the previous discussion about Dickens and his novels. This section appears to be a separate narrative thread that is not clearly connected to the main topic. [COHERENCE]

4) There's a sudden and unexplained quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts that seems completely out of place in the context of discussing Dickens and "Edwin Drood." [COHERENCE]

5) The text jumps from a detailed analysis of Dickens' writing style to a character list and plot summary of "Edwin Drood" without clear transition or explanation of how these elements connect. [STRUCTURE]

6) The text includes references to other critics and works (like Mr. R. A. Proctor and "Watched by the Dead") without clear explanation of how they relate to the main analysis. [COHERENCE]

7) The text has some confusing references to characters and plot points that aren't clearly explained in the context of the analysis. For example, "Jasper" is mentioned multiple times without proper introduction in the analysis section. [CLARITY]

8) There are some unclear transitions between paragraphs that make it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument. [TRANSITION]

9) The text mixes different narrative modes - sometimes it reads like a literary analysis, sometimes like a narrative summary, and sometimes like a fictional scene. This inconsistency in voice and perspective affects coherence. [STRUCTURE]

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of the text as a 3. The text has some coherent sections but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Now let me refine my assessment:

The most serious issues are the out-of-place narrative sections (about "The Eve" and Stransom) and the sudden quote about Lord Canterville, which are completely disconnected from the main topic. These represent significant coherence problems that disrupt the logical flow of the text.

The text also has issues with transitions between different sections and modes of writing, which affects its overall coherence.

I'll give the text a coherence score of 3, as it has some coherent elements but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.
