Let me analyze the text for coherence issues and then provide a rating.

First, I'll go through the text and identify any coherence problems:

1) [LOGIC] The introduction starts with the author writing about Will Bradley's work in graphic arts, but then transitions to "the analysis of Dickens's last plot" which is completely unrelated to the topic of Will Bradley.

2) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. It starts with an introduction to Will Bradley, then shifts to a detailed narrative about a character named Stransom and a jeweler's shop, which doesn't seem to relate to Bradley at all.

3) [LOGIC] The narrative about Stransom appears in the middle of the text about Will Bradley without any logical connection or introduction. It reads like a separate short story that's been inserted without context.

4) [COHERENCE] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Will Bradley's career and impact to a completely different narrative about a boy named Willie in Ishpeming, with no clear connection between these sections.

5) [STRUCTURE] The text contains multiple disconnected sections that appear to be different documents or chapters: an introduction about Will Bradley, a narrative about Stransom, and a biography of a boy printer in Ishpeming.

6) [LOGIC] The text mentions "Sir Simon" and his mysterious disappearance, which seems to be part of yet another unrelated narrative thread that has no connection to Bradley or the other stories.

7) [COHERENCE] The overall structure of the text is confusing, with multiple narratives that appear to be from different sources or authors but are presented as a single text.

8) [LOGIC] The text discusses Will Bradley's career and impact, then shifts to a narrative about a boy named Willie who appears to be Bradley as a child, but there's no clear indication that these are the same person.

9) [COHERENCE] The text includes a narrative about a character named Stransom that appears to be a complete story in itself, with a beginning, middle, and end, but it's inserted in the middle of a text about Will Bradley without explanation.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2 on the scale. The text has significant coherence problems with frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing. While some parts may be understandable individually, the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort due to the multiple disconnected narratives and abrupt shifts between topics.

Let me verify my assessment against the scale:

Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.

This fits my assessment as the text has multiple disconnected narratives with no clear logical connections between them, making it difficult to follow the overall message or purpose of the text.
