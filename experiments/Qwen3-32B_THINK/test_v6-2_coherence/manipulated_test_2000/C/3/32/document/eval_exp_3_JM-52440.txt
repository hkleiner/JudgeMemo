Let me analyze the text for coherence issues. I'll read through it carefully to identify any problems with logical flow, organization, or transitions.

The text appears to be an excerpt from a religious work discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's a formal theological treatise.

Looking for coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between general statements about doctrine and specific theological arguments without clear transitions. There are long paragraphs that cover multiple points without clear organization.

2) [CLARITY] There are several instances of unclear or ambiguous phrases, such as "the stuff" which is used repeatedly but never clearly defined. The meaning is only inferable from context as "the Church" or "the Church of England."

3) [LOGIC] Some of the arguments contain logical leaps or assumptions that are not clearly explained. For example, the author states that the Church of England's teaching on baptism must be consistent with its teaching on the Lord's Supper, but doesn't fully justify why this must be the case.

4) [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt. The author moves from one theological point to another without clearly indicating the relationship between them.

5) [LOGIC] There are instances of circular reasoning or assumptions that are not properly supported. For example, the author assumes that the Church of England's teaching must be coherent across all sacraments without providing evidence for this assumption.

6) [CLARITY] Some key terms are not clearly defined, such as "real presence," "accidents," and "consecration." This makes it harder for the reader to follow the argument.

7) [LOGIC] The author makes claims about the Church of England's teaching without clearly distinguishing between what is actually stated in the Church's documents and what is the author's interpretation of those documents.

8) [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure. It starts with an introduction, moves to a discussion of the real presence, then focuses on the Articles of Religion, but there's not always a clear progression from one section to the next.

9) [CLARITY] There are some grammatical issues that affect clarity, such as sentence fragments and missing articles or prepositions.

10) [LOGIC] The author sometimes presents opposing views without clearly distinguishing between them or explaining the relationship between different theological positions.

Considering these issues, I would rate the coherence of the text as follows:

The text is generally coherent and follows a logical progression in discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper and the Church of England's position. However, there are several coherence issues that affect the clarity and logical flow of the argument. The use of ambiguous terms, the lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, and the occasional logical leaps all contribute to a text that is somewhat difficult to follow at times.

Based on the scale provided:
- A 5 would be for a text that is highly coherent with a clear and logical progression
- A 4 would be for a text that is mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts
- A 3 would be for a text that is generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts or confusing segments
- A 2 would be for a text with frequent inconsistencies or disconnected ideas
- A 1 would be for a largely incoherent text

Given the issues I've identified, I would rate this text a 3.5. It has a generally coherent structure and logical progression, but there are enough coherence issues (especially with clarity and transitions) to warrant a score below 4.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Coherence Issues:
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous use of the term "the stuff" throughout the text
- [STRUCTURE] Long paragraphs with multiple points that lack clear organization
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections
- [LOGIC] Logical leaps and assumptions that are not clearly explained
- [CLARITY] Unclear definitions of key theological terms
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure with some unclear progression between sections
- [LOGIC] Confusion between the Church's actual documents and the author's interpretation
- [CLARITY] Grammatical issues that affect clarity
- [LOGIC] Presentation of opposing views without clear distinction

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
