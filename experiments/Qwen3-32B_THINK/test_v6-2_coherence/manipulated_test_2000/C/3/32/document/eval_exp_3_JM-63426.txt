Let me analyze the coherence of this text:

First, I'll detect problems in terms of coherence that lead to a point deduction:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text has two chapters, but the transition between them is abrupt and lacks a clear connection. The first chapter is an introduction about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, while the second chapter abruptly shifts to a detailed, almost fictionalized account of Bradley's childhood and early career.

2) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous "thing" placeholders that should presumably be specific locations or objects but are left as generic "thing" - these create confusion and break the flow of the narrative.

3) [CLARITY] There are several instances of vague references that make it difficult to follow the narrative. For example, "a stuff" appears multiple times without clear meaning.

4) [LOGIC] The narrative jumps through time periods and locations without clear transitions. The story moves from Bradley's childhood in Massachusetts to his time in Michigan to his career as a printer, but these transitions are not well connected.

5) [COHERENCE] The text shifts between different narrative styles - at times it reads like a formal introduction, at other times it reads like a fictionalized biography with specific details about Bradley's childhood.

6) [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitional phrases or sentences between different sections or ideas. The narrative jumps from one topic to another without smooth transitions.

7) [COHERENCE] The text mixes different levels of formality and perspective - at times it's a formal introduction, at other times it's a first-person narrative of Bradley's childhood, and at other times it's a more objective account of his career.

Now, let me summarize these issues and give a score:

The text has significant coherence problems that affect its overall flow and readability. The abrupt shift between the formal introduction and the fictionalized childhood narrative is particularly jarring. The numerous placeholders ("thing," "a stuff") and vague references make it difficult to follow the narrative. The transitions between different time periods and locations are unclear. The text also shifts between different narrative styles and levels of formality without clear transitions.

Considering these issues, I would rate the text a 2.5 on the coherence scale. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort, but it does have some coherent segments and the overall narrative is somewhat understandable despite the issues.
