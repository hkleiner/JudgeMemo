Let me analyze the text for coherence issues.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to understand what it's about and identify any problems with coherence.

The text appears to be an introduction and first chapter of a biography about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist. The first chapter is an introduction written by someone else (presumably the editor or another author), while the second chapter is titled "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" and appears to be a fictionalized account of Bradley's early life.

Now, I'll identify coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different perspectives and styles. The first chapter is a more formal introduction written in the third person, while the second chapter is written in the second person as if addressing Will Bradley directly. This shift is jarring and lacks a clear transition.

2) [CLARITY] There are numerous spelling and typographical errors that make the text difficult to follow. For example: "seem" instead of "seen"; "wrebknown" instead of "were known"; "cderivative" instead of "derivative"; "om" instead of "on"; "im" instead of "in"; "coveref" instead of "covered"; "wre" instead of "were"; "rethrn" instead of "return"; "cemts" instead of "cents"; "qant" instead of "want"; "Youngo" instead of "Young"; "Bkston" instead of "Boston"; "wzit" instead of "wait"; "c" instead of "and"; "esucation" instead of "education"; "boioer" instead of "boiler"; "og" instead of "of"; "toqn" instead of "town"; "freauently" instead of "frequently"; "prdss" instead of "press"; "boardcand" instead of "board and".

3) [LOGIC] The second chapter is presented as a fictionalized account of Bradley's early life, but it's unclear whether this is meant to be taken as a literal biography or a more stylized narrative. The shift from the formal introduction to this more anecdotal, almost childlike narrative is abrupt and doesn't provide a clear logical connection.

4) [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear narrative thread. The first chapter provides a more general overview of Bradley's impact, while the second chapter jumps into a detailed, almost day-by-day account of his childhood without clear contextualization.

5) [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is confusing. It's not clear whether this is one continuous piece or two separate chapters with different styles and perspectives. The lack of clear chapter breaks or formatting helps makes the transition between the two sections more jarring.

6) [LOGIC] The introduction mentions that the author hasn't seen the book's text before agreeing to write the introduction, but then proceeds to discuss Bradley's work in detail. This creates a logical inconsistency that isn't resolved.

7) [COHERENCE] The text mixes different levels of formality and tone. The first chapter is more academic and analytical, while the second is more personal and anecdotal. This shift in tone isn't smooth or well-justified.

8) [CLARITY] The text contains some confusing or ambiguous phrases, such as "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any esquisite backwater" and "you are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." These phrases are difficult to interpret without additional context.

9) [COHERENCE] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions or signposting, making it difficult to follow the chronology of Bradley's life and career.

10) [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory information or makes claims that are not well-supported. For example, it states that Bradley's work was "absorbed into our culture so completely that many of the young men cavorting brilliantly in his wake today are scarcely aware of their debt to him," but then contradicts this by saying "he is aware of them."

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as follows:

The text has significant coherence problems. The shifts in perspective, style, and tone are abrupt and not well-justified. The numerous spelling and typographical errors make the text difficult to follow. The overall structure is confusing, and the text lacks a clear narrative thread. The logical inconsistencies and ambiguous phrases further contribute to the lack of coherence.

Given these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 2.5 out of 5. The text has some coherent elements, particularly in the first chapter, but the overall lack of structure, numerous errors, and abrupt shifts in perspective and style significantly impact the coherence of the text.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from a formal introduction to a fictionalized childhood narrative without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Numerous spelling and typographical errors that hinder comprehension
- [LOGIC] Confusing presentation of the text as both a biography and a fictionalized account
- [COHERENCE] Lack of clear narrative thread connecting the two chapters
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear overall structure of the text and relationship between the two sections
- [LOGIC] Logical inconsistencies in the text, such as the author claiming not to have seen the book's text before writing the introduction but then discussing it in detail
- [COHERENCE] Jarring shifts in tone and formality between the two sections
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous and difficult-to-interpret phrases throughout the text
- [COHERENCE] Confusing jumps between time periods and events without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Contradictory statements about Bradley's awareness of his influence

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
