Okay, let's start by reading through the text carefully to understand its main points and structure. The author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, specifically between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The text is written in a somewhat informal and enthusiastic tone, with many references to biblical descriptions and local geography.

First, I need to assess the coherence of the text. Coherence refers to how well the ideas are connected and how logically the text flows. Let me look for any issues that might disrupt the reader's understanding.

The text begins with the author's personal journey in discovering the Garden of Eden, which sets a narrative. However, there's a lot of jumping between different ideas without clear transitions. For example, the author starts by explaining why they were slow to publish their findings, then shifts to a discussion of the biblical account of Eden, followed by a detailed description of the geographical location. The flow between these sections isn't smooth, which could confuse the reader.

Another issue is the lack of clear structure. The text doesn't follow a logical progression that would guide the reader from one idea to the next. There are multiple sections that introduce new points without connecting them to the previous ones. For instance, after discussing the geographical features of the area, the author suddenly talks about the presence of rattlesnakes and their historical significance, which seems out of place.

There are also some logical inconsistencies. The author mentions that Eden should be free of easily obtainable wealth to prevent corruption, yet later describes the area as fertile and habitable. This contradiction could confuse the reader and weaken the argument's coherence.

Transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt. For example, after discussing the location of Eden, the author shifts to a detailed description of the "Hanging Garden" without a clear link. This makes the text feel disjointed, as if the ideas are presented randomly rather than in a logical sequence.

Additionally, the text contains some unclear references and jargon. Phrases like "antldiluvians" and "prlper dimentions" are misspelled or archaic, making them harder to understand. The author also uses terms like "thr 'North West'" and "thr first a little above high water mark" without proper explanations, which could hinder the reader's comprehension.

There are instances where the author's enthusiasm leads to overly verbose descriptions that don't contribute to the main argument. For example, the detailed account of Mr. Dovile killing rattlesnakes, while interesting, doesn't clearly support the claim about Eden's location and might distract from the main points.

The conclusion also seems rushed. The author mentions the city of La Crosse and its features, but this is presented without a clear connection to the overall argument about Eden's location. This abrupt ending leaves the reader without a satisfying resolution to the text's main thesis.

Overall, the text has several coherence issues that affect its readability. The lack of logical structure, abrupt transitions, unclear references, and contradictions all contribute to a disjointed reading experience. While the author presents an interesting idea, the way it's presented makes it difficult to follow and understand coherently.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow between personal narrative, biblical analysis, and geographical description without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory claims (e.g., Eden should lack wealth but is described as fertile/habitable).  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of archaic/spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "prlper dimentions") hinders comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts from theological speculation to detailed local geography (e.g., rattlesnake anecdotes).  
- [ORGANIZATION] Lack of cohesive argument structure; ideas presented in a random, meandering order.  
- [COHERENCE] Repetition of "garden" claims without building a unified narrative or evidence chain.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
