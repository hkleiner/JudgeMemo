Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully to understand the main ideas and how they connect. The text is an introduction and a chapter about Will Bradley's early life and career as a printer. 

First, the introduction seems to be a preface written by someone else, discussing Bradley's impact on American graphic arts. Then the second chapter is a narrative of Bradley's childhood and early career. 

Looking at coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the structure makes sense. Let me note any problems I see.

In the first part, the author talks about Bradley's influence and his work's impact. Then it shifts to his early life. The transition between these two parts might be abrupt. Also, the narrative in the second chapter is very detailed and chronological, but does it connect well with the introduction?

I notice some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" and "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep" – these might be typos or errors that affect clarity. However, the evaluation is about coherence, not grammar, so maybe these are minor unless they disrupt the flow.

The structure seems to be two distinct chapters. The first is more analytical, the second a narrative. The shift between these might not be smooth. Also, in the second chapter, there are a lot of specific details about Bradley's early life, but does each event logically lead to the next? 

There's a lot of detail about his childhood, moving to different places, working in print shops. The flow is mostly chronological, but some parts might be repetitive or not clearly connected to his later career. For example, the part about the schoolhouse and his father's illness – does this tie into his development as a printer?

Also, the text uses a lot of past tense and hypothetical scenarios, like "You are six years old; next month you would be seven." This might create a disjointed narrative if not properly framed. The use of "you" in the second chapter is a bit confusing – is this a narrative technique or a mistake? It might make the reader unsure if it's a second-person narrative or a mistake in the text.

There's a transition from the introduction to the second chapter that's abrupt. The introduction talks about Bradley's impact, and then the second chapter dives into his childhood. A smoother transition might help coherence.

Also, some sentences are very long and complex, which might make it harder to follow the logic. For example, the sentence starting with "Across the Atlantic..." is a long list of events without clear connections. This could make the text feel cluttered.

Another issue is the shift in focus. The introduction discusses Bradley's influence on American graphic arts, but the second chapter is about his personal life and early career. The connection between these two parts isn't made explicit, which might confuse the reader about the text's overall purpose.

There are also some parts where the narrative seems to jump between different time periods or events without clear transitions. For example, moving from his childhood in Lynn to moving to Swampscott, then to Boston, then to Northern Michigan, etc. Without clear transitions, this can disrupt the flow.

Additionally, the text mentions specific events and people (like Theodore Roosevelt's lawsuit) without sufficient context. If the reader is unfamiliar with these, it might be confusing and break the coherence of the narrative.

In summary, the main coherence issues are abrupt transitions between chapters, lack of clear connections between the introduction and the narrative chapter, overly detailed and potentially repetitive content in the second chapter, and some confusing narrative techniques like the use of "you." The structure could be more organized to better connect Bradley's early life with his later impact on graphic arts.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the analytical introduction and the narrative chapter without connecting the themes
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative in second chapter using second-person "you" without clear framing or purpose
- [TRANSITION] Unclear connections between childhood anecdotes and Bradley's later career as a printer/graphic artist
- [CLARITY] Confusing temporal shifts in the second chapter with minimal transitional phrases
- [STRUCTURE] Overly detailed chronological account of childhood that lacks thematic organization
- [LOGIC] Missing causal links between early life events and Bradley's artistic development
- [CLARITY] Inconsistent tense usage ("you are", "you was") that disrupts narrative flow
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Bradley's impact on American arts to detailed childhood vignettes
- [CLARITY] Unclear relationship between specific historical references (e.g., Roosevelt lawsuit) and Bradley's story

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
