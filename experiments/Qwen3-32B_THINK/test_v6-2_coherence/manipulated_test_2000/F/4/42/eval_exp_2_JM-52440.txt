Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The text is an excerpt from a book discussing the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England. The author is examining whether the Church teaches this doctrine, referencing various documents like the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies.

First, I need to assess the coherence of the text. Coherence here refers to how well the sentences and ideas flow together logically, forming a unified and organized whole. Let me look for any issues that might disrupt this flow.

Starting with the introduction, the author talks about confident assertions versus proven facts. The transition into discussing the Church of England's doctrine seems logical. However, in the first paragraph, there's a mix of past and present tenses, which might confuse the reader. For example, "The result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion" uses present tense, but then switches to "if the real groundwork of that opinion am examined," which is grammatically incorrect and might be a typo (should be "is examined"). This kind of inconsistency can affect clarity and flow.

Moving to the next section, the author mentions three main points: Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The transition here is smooth, but when discussing the Real Presence, the author starts with a strong statement about the foundation of the controversy. However, there's a sudden shift from discussing scriptural references to the differences between Rome and the Church of England. The connection between these points isn't clearly established, leading to a possible abrupt transition.

In the section about the Articles, the author explains the Church's definition of sacraments. The explanation is detailed, but the frequent use of archaic language and complex sentence structures might make it hard to follow. For example, "Sacraments ordain of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian menâ€™s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace..." is a long sentence that could be broken down for better readability. Additionally, the author references multiple articles and their content, which, while thorough, could be better organized to show how each article supports the overall argument.

Another issue is the lack of clear signposting. The author jumps between discussing the general definition of sacraments and specific examples like baptism and the Eucharist without clearly indicating how they relate to the main argument about the Real Presence. This could make it difficult for readers to see the logical progression.

There's also some repetition of ideas. The author emphasizes the distinction between the visible sign and the invisible gift multiple times, which is important, but the repetition might dilute the impact and suggest a lack of varied argumentation.

Grammar and syntax issues further hinder coherence. The text has several instances of incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement, such as "they was the true expositors" and "if the real groundwork of that opinion am examined." These errors can disrupt the flow and make the text less credible.

In terms of structure, the text is divided into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the internal structure of each section could be improved. For example, when discussing the Articles, the author could have used subheadings or bullet points to list the key points of each article, making it easier for readers to follow the argument.

Overall, the text presents a detailed argument but suffers from several coherence issues, including inconsistent tenses, abrupt transitions, complex and repetitive sentences, and grammatical errors. These issues make the text harder to follow and reduce its overall coherence.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear transitions between discussing scriptural references and doctrinal differences between Rome and the Church of England.
- [LOGIC] Repetition of the visible/invisible distinction without clear progression of ideas.
- [CLARITY] Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "they was" instead of "were").
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from general sacrament definitions to specific examples (baptism) without clear connection to the Eucharist.
- [STRUCTURE] Overly complex sentence structures and archaic phrasing that obscure logical flow.
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear signposting between the three main points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice).

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
