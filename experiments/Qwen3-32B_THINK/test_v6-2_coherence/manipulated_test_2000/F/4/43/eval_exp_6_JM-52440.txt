Let me analyze the text for coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria:

First, I'll read through the text carefully to understand its content and structure:

The text is an essay on the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It begins with an introduction that sets out the author's purpose to investigate whether the Church of England teaches the doctrine of the Real Presence. The author claims that many people wrongly believe this doctrine is taught by the Church of England, and that they should instead examine the Church's own documents to determine the truth.

The text then moves to the first chapter on the Real Presence, discussing various theological interpretations of the Eucharist. It contrasts the Roman Catholic view with what the author perceives as the Church of England's position. The author discusses the Articles of Religion of the Church of England, particularly focusing on Articles 25-31, to support their argument.

Now, let me identify coherence issues:

1) [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes logical leaps without proper explanation. For example, it claims that the Church of England's definition of sacraments in general and baptism specifically implies a certain position on the Eucharist, but it doesn't clearly establish why this must be the case.

2) [CLARITY] There are several instances of unclear or confusing writing. For example, the sentence "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." is completely incoherent and appears to be a grammatical error.

3) [STRUCTURE] The text often shifts between different levels of analysis without clear transitions. It moves from general theological discussion to specific analysis of Church of England documents, but these transitions are not always clearly marked.

4) [COHERENCE] The text sometimes contradicts itself or presents arguments that don't follow logically from previous points. For example, it claims to be examining the Church of England's teaching on the Real Presence, but then spends a significant portion of the text discussing the Roman Catholic position without clearly connecting it back to the Church of England's position.

5) [ORGANIZATION] The organization of the text is somewhat inconsistent. The author announces they will examine the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies of the Church of England, but the text only begins to examine the Articles and doesn't complete the promised analysis.

6) [TRANSITION] There are frequent abrupt transitions between ideas without proper connecting phrases or sentences. This makes the flow of the argument less smooth.

7) [COHERENCE] The text sometimes uses complex theological terminology without adequately defining it for readers who may not be familiar with the specific doctrines being discussed.

8) [CLARITY] There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that make the text difficult to follow. For example, "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift. It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into." is incoherent and appears to be a grammatical error.

9) [COHERENCE] The author makes claims about the Church of England's position without providing sufficient evidence from the Church's documents to support these claims.

10) [LOGIC] The argument structure is sometimes circular. For example, the author claims that the Church of England's general definition of sacraments implies a certain position on the Eucharist, but then uses this implied position as evidence for the Church's teaching.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as a 3 on the coherence scale. The text is generally coherent and follows a logical structure, but it contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience. The most serious issues are the logical leaps, grammatical errors, and unclear transitions that make the argument harder to follow than it should be.

- [COHERENCE] Complex theological terminology used without adequate definitions
- [CLARITY] Incoherent sentence: "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into."
- [COHERENCE] Claims about Church of England position made without sufficient evidence from documents
