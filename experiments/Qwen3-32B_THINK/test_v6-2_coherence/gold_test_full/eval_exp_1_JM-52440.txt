I'll analyze the text for coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I need to understand what coherence means in this context. It's about whether the text makes sense as a whole, with ideas organized and connected logically.

Looking at the text, which is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England, I notice several characteristics:

1. It has a clear structure with an introduction and three main chapters.
2. It presents a logical argument with supporting evidence.
3. It maintains a consistent point of view throughout.

However, there are some coherence issues I can identify:

[STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas without losing track of the main argument.
[CLARITY] The language is very formal and archaic at times, which could make the meaning less clear to modern readers.
[TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, especially when moving from one point to another.
[CLARITY] The text sometimes uses complex theological terminology without always providing clear definitions.
[LOGIC] The argument is logical overall, but some readers might find the depth of analysis overwhelming and potentially confusing.
[CLARITY] The author occasionally makes strong assertions without fully explaining the reasoning, which could create confusion.
[STRUCTURE] The text moves between different documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies) without always clearly connecting these to the central thesis.

Given these observations, I would rate the coherence of the text as a 4.5. The text is mostly coherent with a clear structure and logical progression of ideas. The author presents a well-organized argument with supporting evidence. However, the text's length and complexity create some challenges for readers, particularly with the dense theological language and the need for careful attention to follow the argument. The issues I've identified are mostly minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall coherence of the text.

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested format:
