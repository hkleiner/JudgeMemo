I'll evaluate the text based on the coherence metric, following the instructions carefully.

First, I'll detect problems in terms of coherence in the text that lead to a point deduction.

After reading through this text, I notice it's a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer. The text is written in a first-person narrative style, but it's not entirely consistent in tense and perspective. It reads like a memoir with some editorial additions at the end.

Now, I'll summarize the detected coherence problems:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure with multiple chapters, some of which are clearly memoirs while others seem to be more factual chronologies or editorial commentary. This creates an inconsistent reading experience.

2) [TENSE] There are frequent shifts in tense, sometimes within the same paragraph. The narrative switches between past, present, and even second-person narration.

3) [PERSPECTIVE] The text shifts between first-person and third-person narration without clear transitions.

4) [CLARITY] Some passages are overly detailed and meandering, making it difficult to follow the central narrative about Will Bradley's life and career.

5) [COHESION] The text lacks a clear through-line or narrative arc. It jumps between different periods in Bradley's life without smooth transitions.

6) [INCONSISTENCY] The text mixes personal memoir with factual chronology and editorial commentary in a way that's confusing.

7) [READABILITY] The text is quite long and dense, with many paragraphs that are excessively long and complex.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

The text has significant coherence problems that affect the reading experience. While it contains valuable information about Will Bradley's life and career, the structural issues, inconsistent tenses and perspectives, and lack of a clear narrative arc make it difficult to follow as a unified whole.

I would give it a score of 2.5 out of 5 for coherence. The text has some coherence in that it does tell a story about Will Bradley, but the structural and stylistic issues significantly impact the reader's ability to follow the narrative smoothly.
