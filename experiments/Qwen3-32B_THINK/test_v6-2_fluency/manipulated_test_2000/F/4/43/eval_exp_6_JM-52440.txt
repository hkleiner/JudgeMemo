Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. The main focus is on fluency issues like grammar, syntax, spelling, and whether the sentences are clear and natural.

First, I'll start by reading through the text carefully. It's a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The language is formal and academic, which is expected for such a topic. However, even in formal writing, clarity and grammatical correctness are essential for fluency.

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure is complex but seems okay. However, as I go further, I notice some issues. For example, in the section discussing the Articles, there's a sentence that starts with "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great..." This seems to be a run-on or fragmented sentence. It's not clear and lacks proper punctuation. That's a problem with syntax and structure.

Another example is the line: "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This is a jumbled mess of words. It looks like a sentence that's been broken up or has missing punctuation, making it incomprehensible. This is a major issue with fluency as it disrupts the reader's understanding.

There are also instances of awkward phrasing. For example, "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." The word "connexion" is a British spelling, which is acceptable, but the sentence structure is a bit stiff. While it's not incorrect, it's not the most natural phrasing in modern English.

Looking for grammar issues, I see some missing articles or prepositions. For example, "In other words, before men they are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or witnesses by which He doth work invisibly in us..." The phrase "before men" and "before God" is okay, but the sentence is a bit convoluted. The use of "doth" is archaic, which might be intentional given the context, but it's not incorrect.

There's also a sentence that reads: "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into." This is completely incoherent. It seems like a sentence fragment or a misplaced clause. This is a significant fluency issue because it's impossible to understand.

Other instances include run-on sentences that could benefit from commas or periods. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." The hyphenation and structure here is a bit off, making the sentence harder to follow.

I also notice some repetition of phrases, which can affect fluency. For example, "The Church of England" is repeated multiple times, which is acceptable in a formal context but could be streamlined for better flow.

In terms of spelling, I don't see any obvious misspellings, though some words are in British English (like "connexion" instead of "connection"), which is consistent throughout the text.

In summary, the main fluency issues are:
1. Jumbled and incoherent sentences that are difficult to parse.
2. Run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
3. Awkward phrasing and archaic language that, while not incorrect, can hinder readability.
4. Missing or incorrect punctuation leading to confusion.

Considering the evaluation criteria, the text has several significant fluency issues that disrupt readability. While the content is complex and the language formal, the errors in syntax and structure make parts of the text hard to follow. Based on the scale, this would likely score a 2 or 2.5. However, since the most serious issues are the incoherent sentences and run-ons, which make comprehension difficult, a score of 2 seems appropriate.
