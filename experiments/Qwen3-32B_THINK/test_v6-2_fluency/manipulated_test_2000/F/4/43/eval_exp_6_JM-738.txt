Let me analyze the text for fluency issues and then provide a score according to the criteria.

First, I'll look for problems with grammar, syntax, spelling, and overall fluency:

1) [SYNTAX] - The text has several run-on sentences with poor punctuation that make it hard to follow the meaning. For example, "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful "A. by a late," deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)." This sentence is incoherent and lacks proper structure.

2) [GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example, "Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_." This sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing.

3) [SYNTAX] - The text contains many sentences that are missing basic elements. For example, "He saw in his vision, "that," I never saw "that" before." This sentence is incomplete and lacks clarity.

4) [GRAMMAR] - There are several instances of incorrect word order and subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "This sixteen, hag determined, we learn hard,"—for a been drunkard,—“I heaven’s-years drank has _before_ she took to opium." The word order is jumbled and confusing.

5) [SYNTAX] - The text has many fragmented or incomplete thoughts that make it difficult to understand the overall meaning. For example, "the agony learn Jasper desires, furiously speak of of so." This appears to be an incomplete thought.

6) [SPELLING] - There are some spelling issues like "Nickleby" which should likely be "Nickleby" or "Nickleby" (I'm not sure of the exact correct spelling of this character, but the inconsistency is noticeable).

7) [SYNTAX] - The text has several sentences that begin with a fragment or preposition. For example, "In the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and has a tiff with Edwin." This is not necessarily incorrect, but it's an unusual structure that affects fluency.

8) [SYNTAX] - There are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that make the text feel unnatural. For example, "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The structure feels awkward and the meaning is somewhat unclear.

9) [SYNTAX] - The text has some confusing use of commas and other punctuation. For example, "He took this drug both in his lodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London, kept by a woman nicknamed "The Princess Puffer." The commas are used inconsistently and sometimes confusingly.

10) [SYNTAX] - There are some confusing sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the logic. For example, "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful "A. by a late," deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)." This sentence is completely incoherent.

Based on these observations, I need to assign a score between 1 and 5 for fluency:

The text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure. While there are some clear passages, comprehension is often difficult without effort. This aligns with the description for a score of 2 on the scale:

- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

However, I should consider if it's a 2 or 2.5. The text is quite problematic, with many serious issues that affect comprehension, but it's not entirely unintelligible. There are still some clear passages that allow readers to understand parts of the text.

Given the extensive issues, I would say the text is more aligned with a 2 than a 2.5, as the frequent errors and confusing structure significantly impact readability.

So my final assessment is:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with poor punctuation
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors
- [SYNTAX] Missing basic sentence elements
- [SPELLING] Spelling issues
- [SYNTAX] Fragmented or incomplete thoughts
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasings and sentence structures
- [SYNTAX] Confusing use of commas and punctuation
- [SYNTAX] Confusing sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the logic

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2
