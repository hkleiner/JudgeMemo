Okay, let's start by looking at the text the user provided. The task is to evaluate its fluency on a scale from 1 to 5, considering grammar, repetition, clarity, and common English usage. 

First, I'll read through the entire text to get a sense of its structure and flow. The text seems to be an argument about locating the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley. The author uses a lot of biblical references and makes comparisons between the Euphrates and Mississippi rivers.

Now, I need to identify fluency issues. Let me go through each paragraph and check for problems.

Starting with the first paragraph: "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." Here, "have ventured to publish it" is missing the subject "I," which is a grammatical error. Also, "reasonable thing of it" is a bit unclear; maybe "reasonable understanding of it" would be better. 

Next, in the second paragraph: "In giving the antldiluvians a description..." The word "antldiluvians" seems to be a typo, probably should be "antediluvians." Also, the sentence structure is a bit convoluted, making it hard to follow. 

Looking at the third paragraph: "the discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden..." The comma before "resulted" is unnecessary, and the phrase "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" could be clearer. "Plat" here might be a typo for "plot" or "plateau." 

In the fourth paragraph: "Where would a scientest place the first pair..." "Scientest" is a misspelling of "scientist." Also, the sentence structure is a bit awkward, with run-on sentences and missing commas. 

Moving to the fifth paragraph: "Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth..." The repetition of "should be" and the phrase "money mineral wealth" is awkward. It might be better as "lacking in valuable minerals." 

In the sixth paragraph: "It is located on the 'eastward bank' of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota." The missing comma after "Winona" is a small but noticeable error. 

The seventh paragraph has several issues: "The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite St. Louis..." The comparison is a bit unclear. Also, "being settled and inhabited by the most industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people..." The hyphen in "christianized" is missing, making it a spelling error. 

In the eighth paragraph: "The river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the 'Laughing' and 'Father of waters,' courses, run, and play their dances." The subject-verb agreement is off here; "courses" should be "course." Also, the phrase "play their dances" is a bit awkward. 

The ninth paragraph is a jumble of words with no clear structure: "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to..." This part is incoherent and hard to follow, which is a major fluency issue. 

The tenth paragraph has some missing words and awkward phrasing: "Now that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this garden. Turn, now and face the south-west..." The repetition of "now" is a bit distracting. 

In the eleventh paragraph: "But possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed." This sentence is a complete mess, with no clear subject or verb, making it impossible to understand. 

The twelfth paragraph has some run-on sentences and awkward phrasing: "The scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as do the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,—and so on down the line,—in their magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden..." The commas and dashes are inconsistently used, which affects readability. 

Overall, the text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and incoherent sections. Some parts are hard to follow due to poor sentence structure and missing punctuation. The author's enthusiasm for the topic is evident, but the fluency issues significantly hinder the readability and understanding of the text.
