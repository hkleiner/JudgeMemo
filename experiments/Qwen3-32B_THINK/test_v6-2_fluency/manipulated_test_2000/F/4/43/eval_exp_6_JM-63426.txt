Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the fluency of the given text on a scale from 1 to 5. The user provided a detailed evaluation criterion, so I should make sure to follow that closely.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to identify any fluency issues. The text is a biographical piece about Will Bradley, written in a somewhat literary and descriptive style. 

Looking for fluency problems, I'll check for grammar, syntax, repetition, and clarity. Let me go through the text again, paragraph by paragraph.

In the first chapter, the introduction, the language is complex but seems grammatically correct. There are some long sentences, but they don't hinder understanding. 

Moving to the second chapter, "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING," there are several issues. For instance, the sentence "cars steamboats trains drawings of sailboats: is, blackboard, covered, chalk houses with, ferryboats, people and animals." This seems like a list but is not properly structured. The use of colons and commas is confusing, and the sentence lacks coherence.

Another example is: "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." This sentence is a jumble of words without clear structure or meaning. It's hard to determine the subject or the verb. 

There's also a sentence: "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window--where you can proudly wave to the schoolchildren as they are going home to their noon meal." The phrase "Having half an hour of leisure you learn" is awkwardly constructed. The subject-verb agreement is off, and the sentence structure is confusing.

Another problematic sentence is: "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." This appears to be a non-sequitur, possibly a typo or a misplaced phrase. It doesn't make sense in context.

The sentence "He brings you a box of pi. When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font you file them to fit the type slot in the press." The word "pi" doesn't make sense here; it might be a typo for "type" or another word.

There are also several instances of run-on sentences or sentences that lack proper punctuation, making them hard to follow. For example, "In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through. Your uncle and aunt go for a visit 'back East.' Your for house your mother keeps cousins." The second sentence is unclear and lacks coherence.

The text uses a lot of complex vocabulary, which might be intentional for the style, but some parts are overly verbose or convoluted. For example, "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." While poetic, it's a bit abstract and might be confusing to some readers.

There are also some instances of repetition, such as the repeated use of "you" in the second chapter, which could be a stylistic choice but might affect readability if overdone.

Overall, the text has some grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentence structures that impact fluency. The issues are not so severe that the text is incomprehensible, but they are frequent enough to affect readability and understanding. 

Considering the evaluation scale, a score of 2.5 might be appropriate. The text contains frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make comprehension difficult at times, though there are clear and readable parts. However, I need to check if the issues are more severe. 

Looking again, some sentences are almost unreadable due to their structure and lack of clarity. For example, "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." This is a complete jumble. Similarly, "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." These are not just minor errors but significant disruptions. 

Given the evaluation criteria, a score of 2 would mean the text has frequent errors and is often difficult to understand. A score of 2.5 would be for texts with frequent errors but some readable parts. The text here has some readable parts, but the issues are quite frequent and do affect understanding significantly. 

Therefore, I would rate the text as a 2.5 on the fluency scale. The major issues are in grammar, syntax, and clarity, with some sentences being particularly problematic.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." (Subject-verb agreement and coherence issues)  
- [SYNTAX] "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." (Fragmented, non-sequitur phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He brings you a box of pi. When you succeed in finding a few letters..." (Unclear reference to "pi" and disjointed logic)  
- [SYNTAX] "Your for house your mother keeps cousins." (Confusing structure; lacks clarity)  
- [SYNTAX] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case..." (Awkward subject-verb order; unclear meaning)  
- [COHERENCE] "cars steamboats trains drawings of sailboats: is, blackboard, covered, chalk houses with, ferryboats..." (Unstructured list; no clear connection to context)  
- [COHERENCE] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." (Parenthetical question mark disrupts flow)
