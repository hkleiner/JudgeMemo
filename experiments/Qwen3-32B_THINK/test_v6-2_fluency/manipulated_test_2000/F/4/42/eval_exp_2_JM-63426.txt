Okay, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. Let me start by reading through it carefully to spot any issues.

First, the text seems to be a biographical piece about Will Bradley. The language is a bit old-fashioned, which might be intentional, but I should check for grammatical errors. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "It shoulded be talked about, because it is hard to realized today..." The verb "shoulded" is incorrect; it should be "should have been". Also, "realized" is used instead of "realize". That's a grammar issue.

Next, "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams: Morris failing to revived medievalism..." Here, "revived" should be "revive" because it's the base form after "to". Another grammar problem.

In the same section: "Beardsley, the Yellow Book and their avant garde galaxy..." The possessive "their" might not be correct here. Since Beardsley and the Yellow Book are the subjects, maybe "his" is intended? Or perhaps it's a syntax issue with the structure.

Then, "Toulouse-Lautrec spread modern art in the kiosks of Paris when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, Seurat; barriers being demolish everywhere." The verb "demolish" should be "demolished" for correct tense agreement. Also, the semicolon usage here might be incorrect if the clauses aren't properly connected.

In the second chapter: "Most of the work is do by hand." The correct form should be "done". Another grammar error.

"Many women worked at home, bound uppers and tongues of high, lace shoes." The phrase "high, lace shoes" might be a syntax issue. Maybe it's "high-lace shoes" or "high lace shoes" but the comma placement is off.

"You carried finished work back to the factories and returned with a supply of unfinished." The verb tenses here are inconsistent. "Carried" and "returned" are past tense, but the context might need past perfect or another tense for clarity.

"Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." The word "pi" is likely a typo for "type" or "ink". That's a spelling error.

In the section about the father's illness: "He tells you he hasn’t long to live, said you have been a good boy..." The structure here is a run-on sentence. The use of a comma instead of a period or semicolon is a syntax issue.

There are several instances of incorrect verb conjugations, like "you was" instead of "you were" and "it will be made to lasted" instead of "last". These are grammar and tense issues.

The sentence structure in some parts is awkward, such as "When the motor power fails, as it did frequently, you went out on the street and employ off-shift miners to operated the press..." The verb "employ" should be "employed" and "operated" should be "operate". Also, the flow is a bit choppy here.

There's also a missing punctuation mark in "In winter it was heated (?) with one stove." The question mark seems misplaced; maybe a period is intended here.

The text has some repetition and awkward phrasing, like "You are now a worked man--wages three dollars a week." The phrase "worked man" is not the usual phrasing; "worker" or "working man" would be better.

Overall, the text is mostly readable but has multiple grammatical errors, inconsistent verb tenses, and some awkward syntax. These issues, while not making the text completely unintelligible, do affect fluency and readability. The score would likely be around 3.5 because the text is generally understandable but has enough issues to disrupt the flow.
