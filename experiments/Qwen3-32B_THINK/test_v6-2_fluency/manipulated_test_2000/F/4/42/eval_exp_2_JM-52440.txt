Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text using the specified criteria and provide a score from 1 to 5 with half points allowed. 

First, I need to identify fluency issues. Fluency here refers to grammatical correctness, non-repetitiveness, and adherence to common English usage with clear meaning. 

Looking at the text, I notice a lot of grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "is teach by the Church" should be "is taught by the Church". There's also "am the true expositors" which is incorrect because "they" should be followed by "are". 

Another issue is the use of incorrect verb tenses. For instance, "give" in "blindly give" should be "given". Also, "was the real point at issue" uses "was" where "is" might be more appropriate depending on the context.

There are instances of subject-verb agreement errors. For example, "those who was loyal" should be "those who were loyal". Similarly, "the point was supposed to had been settle" has incorrect verb form; it should be "had been settled".

The text also has awkward phrasing and word choice. Phrases like "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time" might be better phrased as "is entering a sifting time". Also, "we was taught by our Lord Himself" should be "we were taught".

Repetition is another problem. The phrase "the Church of England" is repeated frequently, which could be made more concise by using "it" or "the Church" after the first mention.

Some sentences are run-on or overly complex, making them hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "But those who was loyal..." is long and has multiple issues that make it confusing.

There are also issues with prepositions and articles. For instance, "the object of this address" is correct, but "the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies" might need commas for clarity.

Looking at the later parts, "the Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—beared more or less upon the subject" uses "beared" which is incorrect; it should be "bear". Also, "worked invisibly in us" should be "works invisibly in us" for correct verb tense.

Overall, the text has numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and awkward phrasing. These issues affect the fluency and readability, making it harder to follow the argument presented. While the content is complex and theological, the fluency problems are significant and would distract a reader. 

Considering the scale, a score of 2 seems appropriate. The text is somewhat understandable but has frequent errors that disrupt the flow and comprehension. However, some parts are clear, which prevents it from being a 1. The errors are not so severe that the entire text is unintelligible, but they are numerous enough to hinder smooth reading.
