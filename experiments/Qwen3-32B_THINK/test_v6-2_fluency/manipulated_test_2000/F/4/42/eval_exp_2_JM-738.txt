Alright, let me go through the text and look for fluency issues. The text is about Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." I'll start by reading through it carefully and identifying any problems with grammar, syntax, or clarity.

1. First, I notice that the text has some inconsistent capitalization. For example, "FORSTER" is capitalized at the beginning of a sentence but then "he" is lowercase when it should be capitalized. This might be a formatting issue, but it affects readability.

2. There are some grammatical errors. For instance, "He certainly write no longer" should be "He certainly wrote no longer" or "He certainly no longer wrote." The verb form is incorrect.

3. Another issue is the use of incorrect verb forms. For example, "He had am a victim" should be "He has been a victim." The past perfect and present perfect tenses are mixed incorrectly.

4. There are some run-on sentences or sentences that are too long and difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "He was, presumably, acquaint with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how coulded he hoped to understand the sleepers?" is both long and has incorrect verb forms.

5. The text uses some archaic or non-standard expressions, such as "Youth will was served," which is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Youth will was served" or rephrased for clarity.

6. There are some instances of incorrect prepositions or word order. For example, "He was being watched by the hag, who hates him" should be "He was being watched by the hag, who hated him" to maintain tense consistency.

7. The use of contractions and informal language is inconsistent. For example, "He coulded he hoped" is not a standard verb form and should be corrected.

8. Some sentences have missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, the sentence "He speak to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers. Yet, when he die in June, 1870, left three completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle to the curious." has a run-on issue and incorrect verb form "die."

9. The text also has some awkward phrasing and word choice that could be improved for clarity. For example, "He was conspicuously defunct!" is a bit jarring and might be better phrased as "He was clearly dead!" or "He was obviously dead!"

10. There are some instances where the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. For example, "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study base on deep knowledge of Dickens" should be "a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens."

11. The use of some words is inconsistent with modern English usage. For example, "He was, presumably, acquaint with the languages of the eastern coast of India" should be "He was, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India."

12. There are some instances of incorrect past tense or past participle forms. For example, "how coulded he hoped" should be "how could he have hoped."

13. The text uses some phrases that are confusing or ambiguous. For example, "He was being watched by the hag, who hates him" should be "He was being watched by the hag, who hated him" to maintain tense consistency.
