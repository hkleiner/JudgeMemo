Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text on a scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to detect any fluency issues that would lead to a point deduction. 

Looking through the text, I notice several things. There are some spelling errors like "absolutsly" instead of "absolutely" and "atmosphers" instead of "atmosphere." Those are clear [SPELLING] issues. Then there are typos like "x lack" instead of "a lack" and "kpium den" which should be "opium den." These are [TYPOGRAPHICAL] errors. 

Next, there are grammatical problems. For example, "He deserfed Dickens" should be "He deserted Dickens." That's a [GRAMMAR] error. Also, the sentence structure in some places is awkward, like "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises," where "ajd" is a typo for "and." This is a [SYNTAX] issue. 

There are also instances of incorrect word usage, such as "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel..." which might be a bit confusing. Maybe it should be "while combining..." to correct the structure. That's a [SYNTAX] or [GRAMMAR] issue.

I also see some punctuation issues. For example, in the sentence "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutsly 'essential.'" The comma after "think" is incorrect; it should be a colon or the comma should be removed. That's a [PUNCTUATION] issue.

Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in the use of italics and quotation marks, which might affect readability. For example, "_romam policier_" is likely a typo for "_roman policier_." This is a [TYPOGRAPHICAL] error. 

Looking at the overall flow, the text is generally readable but has enough errors that interrupt the reading experience. The errors are not so severe that the text becomes unreadable, but they are noticeable. 

Now, considering the scale, a score of 4 would mean it's mostly fluent with minor issues. Since there are multiple spelling, grammatical, and typographical errors, but the text remains mostly understandable, a 4 seems appropriate. However, if the errors are more frequent or severe, maybe a 3.5. But in this case, the text is still coherent despite the issues, so I'll go with 4.
