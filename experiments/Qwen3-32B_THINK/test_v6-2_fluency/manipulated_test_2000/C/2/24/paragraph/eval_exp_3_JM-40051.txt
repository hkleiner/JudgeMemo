Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. First, I'll read through it carefully to spot any issues.

Starting with the first paragraph, the title is a bit long and has some awkward phrasing like "the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered." The colon and "Or" might not be the best structure here. 

Looking at the first sentence: "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The phrase "first know you are right" is a bit unclear. Maybe "first be sure you are right" would be better, but as it is, it's a bit awkward. Also, "have a reasonable thing of it" is confusing. Should it be "have a reasonable understanding of it"?

Next, "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." The capitalization of "CHAPTER" is odd. Maybe it's a typo for "Chapter" or "independent" should be lowercase. The phrase "invite general inspection, and criticism" is missing a conjunction; maybe "inspection and criticism" would be better.

In the second paragraph: "In giving the antldiluvians a description..." "Antldiluvians" is misspelled; it should be "antediluvians." That's a spelling error. Then, "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them..." The dash here is used instead of a comma, which might be a syntax issue. The sentence structure is a bit tangled, making it hard to follow.

Continuing, "as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the location..." There's a comma splice here. The semicolon might be appropriate, but the sentence is still complex and could be clearer.

The phrase "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." The use of "finger of time" is a bit poetic but might be confusing. Also, "as the place" is redundant. Maybe "as the location" would be better.

In the paragraph starting with "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible..." There's a comma after "The discovery," which is unnecessary. Also, "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery..." "Admirirg" is a typo for "admiring." The sentence is a bit long and could be split for clarity.

"Of course I had never given it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or might be its proper dimentions." "Dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions." Also, "measured it up in my own mind" is a bit awkward. Maybe "measured its proper dimensions in my mind."

In the next section: "Where would a scientest place the first pair..." "Scientest" is a typo for "scientist." Also, the sentence structure is a bit confusing. The author is trying to make a point about the location being suitable, but the phrasing is not very clear.

The paragraph about the garden's characteristics has some issues. For example, "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies..." The phrase "money mineral wealth" is awkward. Maybe "material wealth" or "mineral riches." Also, the sentence is a bit convoluted.

In the section about the Mississippi River: "The Mississippi—the bible Euphrates—river..." The hyphens here might be better as em dashes for clarity. Also, "bible" should be "Bible." The sentence structure is a bit confusing, and the comparison between the Mississippi and the Euphrates is not clearly explained.

There are several instances of missing commas and incorrect capitalization. For example, "the Euphrates river crosses that country, that 'eastward', or on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is located the garden of Eden..." The repetition of "eastward" and the placement of commas make this sentence hard to follow.

The phrase "the names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations of facts well known to the antideluvians." The use of "doubtless" is a bit archaic, but not necessarily an error. However, the sentence is a bit vague.

In the paragraph about the location between La Crosse and Winona: "The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to be the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable..." The comparison is a bit unclear, and the sentence is long and complex.

There are some instances of inconsistent terminology, like "the river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the 'Laughing' and 'Father of waters,' courses, run, and play their dances." The use of "courses" and "run" is a bit redundant, and the sentence structure is confusing.

The text also has some run-on sentences and missing commas, making it hard to parse. For example: "Now, please, place yourself with me on the 'Central Outer Dome' 'Heald’s quarry,' facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below, and around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and importance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world." The semicolon here is used incorrectly; a period might be better. Also, the phrase "unequalled in America, and I think, in the world" is a bit awkward.

There are several typos and misspellings, such as "consitutes" instead of "constitutes," "hightest" instead of "highest," "jageed" instead of "jagged," and "ampitheater" instead of "amphitheater." These are spelling errors.

The text also uses some archaic or overly formal language, which might not be considered fluent in modern English. For example, "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them..." This is a bit stiff and could be more concise.

Overall, the text is filled with grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, and misspellings. The author's attempt to be poetic and descriptive leads to complex sentences that are hard to follow. There are also inconsistencies in terminology and capitalization. These issues significantly affect the fluency of the text, making it less readable and harder to understand.
