Let me analyze the text for fluency issues according to the evaluation criteria:

1) Fluency Issues:

First, I'll scan the text for any problems with fluency, including grammar, syntax, word choice, and overall readability.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:

- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the first line: "-WILL BRADLEY: HIS CHAP BOOK-"

- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "Walking home at the close of a busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect of a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin and before which several persons were gathered."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "It was the window of a jeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like high notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were “worth” than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side of the pane."

- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "Stransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but just with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed him in the very act of laying his hand on his friend’s arm."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "It lasted but the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild question."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?—the ambiguity met him there in the short drop of her husband’s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was, and in the way the two figures leaned to each other."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "Creston, making a step to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and exclaimed—behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave Stransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face, the wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred ravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "That son of affliction wasn’t in mourning now; he detached his arm from his companion’s to grasp the hand of the older friend."

- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues in the line: "My memory is long enough that I can say for all these latecomers, “Thank you no end for everything, Will Bradley.”"

There are also some word choice issues:

- [WORD CHOICE] "He was arrested in the London street by the particular effect of a shop-front" - "arrested" is used metaphorically here, which might be confusing
- [WORD CHOICE] "The diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh" - "laugh" is used metaphorically in a way that might be confusing
- [WORD CHOICE] "The poor man had shown him last, the blurred ravaged mask bent over the open grave" - this sentence is confusing and hard to follow
- [WORD CHOICE] "He coloured as well as smiled" - "coloured" is not the most natural word choice in this context
- [WORD CHOICE] "They should be--he is aware of them" - this sentence is confusing and hard to follow
- [WORD CHOICE] "
