Let me analyze this text for fluency issues according to the given criteria.

First, I need to understand what fluency means in this context. According to the instructions, fluency measures the quality of individual sentences in terms of grammatical correctness, non-repetition, and accord with common English usage with clear meanings.

Looking through the text, I notice several issues:

1) Grammar issues:
- There are many run-on sentences and sentence fragments
- Some sentences have missing subjects or verbs
- There are incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues
- There are dangling modifiers and misplaced phrases

2) Syntax issues:
- Some sentences have awkward or unnatural word order
- There are some sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts
- Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted

3) Lexicon issues:
- Some words appear to be misspelled or used incorrectly
- There are some non-idiomatic expressions
- Some phrases are awkward or unnatural in English

4) Repetition issues:
- Some phrases are repeated unnecessarily
- Some ideas are expressed in a repetitive manner

5) Clarity issues:
- Some sentences are ambiguous or have unclear meanings
- Some ideas are not clearly connected to the rest of the text
- Some transitions between ideas are missing or awkward

Let me now identify the most serious problems that justify point deductions:

1) [GRAMMAR] "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This sentence is a complete jumble of words with no clear meaning.

2) [GRAMMAR] "There was always a giant’s spirit in this powerful little man, and it’s as strong and generous now as it ever was. My memory is long enough that I can say for all these latecomers, “Thank you no end for everything, Will Bradley.”" The shift from "it's" to "My memory" is jarring and the sentence structure is awkward.

3) [SYNTAX] "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that." This is a sentence fragment with jumbled words and no clear meaning.

4) [GRAMMAR] "You Kasten designs lancing-McClurg the stationery are free and for making now of Mr. department." This sentence has incorrect word order and is grammatically incoherent.

5) [GRAMMAR] "Your studio is now in the Monadnock building. It is the year of the World’s Fair. You have an exhibit that has entitled you to a pass." The pronoun "you" is used in a confusing way when it appears the text is referring to the author rather than the subject.

6) [SYNTAX] "The mixing of roman and italic in radically different sizes and with consideration for desired emphasis, with possibly a 96- or 120-point roman cap starting a 48- or 60-point italic word, resulted just as I had visualized while the type was being set in fragmentary form." This sentence is overly complex and difficult to follow.

7) [GRAMMAR] "In these early Nineties no cash is needed to buy a printing outfit, just an agreement to pay a monthly installment." This sentence has an awkward structure and unclear meaning.

8) [SYNTAX] "The Chicago World’s Fair. In 1895 To Springfield, Mass., the launching of his Wayside Press, “At the Sign of the Dandelion,” and plans for publication of Bradley: His Book ... his love for Caslon and the beginning of a new Caslon era as a result." This is a fragment with missing context and poor sentence structure.

9) [GRAMMAR] "A CHRONOLOGY This brief biography of the man called Dean of American Designers by The Saturday Evening Post and Dean of American Art Editors by Publishers’ Weekly, is amplified from its earlier compilation and printing as a Typophile keepsake in 1948." The sentence structure is awkward and the meaning is unclear.

10) [SYNTAX] "The sources: A booklet titled Memories: 1875-1895, printed for the Typophiles and other friends by Grant Dahlstrom in Pasadena, 1949; another titled Picture of a Period, or Memories of the Gay Nineties, printed for the Rounce and Coffin Club of Los Angeles (also by Dahlstrom) in 1950; the Huntington Library hand list, Will Bradley: His Work, 1951 (again printed by Dahlstrom)." This is a very long sentence that would be more readable as multiple sentences.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency of this text as follows:

The text contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways. While it is generally readable, the numerous issues with grammar, syntax, and clarity make it less than ideal. There are several sentences that are difficult to understand or have no clear meaning.

According to the scale, this would fall into the "Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways."

So my final score would be 3.
