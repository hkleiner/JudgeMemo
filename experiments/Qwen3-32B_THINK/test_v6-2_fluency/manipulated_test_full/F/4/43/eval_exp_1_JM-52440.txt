Okay, let's start by carefully reading the given text. The user provided a lengthy theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. My task is to evaluate its fluency based on the given criteria.

First, I'll look for any fluency issues. The text is quite long and dense, so I need to check for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structures. Let me scan through the content.

Looking at the first few paragraphs, the sentences are long and complex. For example: "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England..." The sentence structure here is a bit convoluted, which might affect readability. 

I notice some instances where the subject and verb don't agree. For example, "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church..." The subject here is "The Scriptures," which is plural, but the verb "is" is singular. That's a [GRAMMAR] error.

Another issue is the use of incorrect prepositions or word order. For instance, "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't make sense. It seems like a [GRAMMAR] or [SYNTAX] problem. 

There are also some awkward phrasings that make the text harder to follow. For example, "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." The use of "whereby" and "on which" is a bit formal and might be confusing for some readers. This could be categorized under [LEXICON].

Looking further, I see some run-on sentences that could be split for clarity. For example, "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." The sentence is long but grammatically correct. However, breaking it into shorter sentences might improve fluency.

I also notice some repetition of phrases, such as "the Church of England" being mentioned multiple times in quick succession, which could be a [LEXICON] issue. While repetition is sometimes intentional for emphasis, excessive repetition can reduce fluency.

There are instances where the author uses archaic or overly formal language, which might be intentional for the theological context but could still be a [LEXICON] issue if it hinders readability for modern readers.

I should also check for punctuation errors. For example, in the sentence "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject..." the em dashes are used correctly here. However, in other parts, the punctuation might be inconsistent or missing, leading to confusion.

Another potential issue is the use of passive voice, which is common in formal writing but can make the text feel less direct. For example, "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." The passive voice here doesn't necessarily hinder fluency but might affect the flow.

Looking for [SPELLING] errors, I don't notice any obvious misspellings. The text seems to be well-edited in that regard.

Now, considering the scale for fluency:

- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues.
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues.
- Score 2: Frequent errors making comprehension difficult.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible.

The text has several grammatical errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few confusing sentences. However, the majority of the text is coherent and follows proper grammar. The errors, while present, don't completely disrupt the overall readability. The complex sentence structures and formal language are part of the theological discourse and might be intentional, but they do contribute to some fluency issues.

Given the evaluation criteria, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The text is generally readable but has multiple grammatical and syntactical issues that interrupt the flow and clarity. The presence of some incoherent sentences (like "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is.") significantly impacts fluency, but the overall content is still understandable. However, since half-points are allowed, I might lean towards 3 if the issues are more severe. But considering that the text is a theological treatise and some complexity is expected, and the errors, while present, don't make it incomprehensible, 3.5 seems appropriate.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors ("The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed...").  
- [SYNTAX] Incoherent sentence fragments ("It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is").  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing and redundancy in complex sentences.  
- [LEXICON] Overly archaic/technical language ("whereby," "connexion") that may hinder readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and poor punctuation in dense theological arguments.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5  

The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical and syntactic issues that disrupt clarity. Incoherent fragments and overly complex phrasing significantly impact fluency, though the overall argument remains discernible.
