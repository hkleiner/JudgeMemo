Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a lengthy text that's supposed to be about finding the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley. My task is to rate the fluency based on the given criteria.

First, I need to check for fluency issues. Fluency includes grammar, clarity, structure, and adherence to common English usage. Let me start reading through the text carefully.

The text is quite old, possibly from the late 19th century. It's filled with archaic language and complex sentences. The first thing I notice is the use of phrases like "In gave the antldiluvians a description" – there's a missing article here, "In gave" should be "In giving". That's a grammar issue. Also, "antldiluvians" seems like a typo for "antediluvians". 

Looking further, there's a sentence: "he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description of the location". The verb tense is inconsistent – "give" should be "gave". Another example: "and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them". Missing "was" or "is" here. 

The text has many run-on sentences and lacks proper punctuation. For example: "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary, and "must place" should be "must have placed" for correct tense. 

There are also some awkward phrasings like "by degrees it has been opened to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent". This is a bit convoluted and could be clearer. 

Another issue is the use of incorrect prepositions. For instance, "the finger of time has am plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'". The phrase "has am plainly pointing" is grammatically incorrect. It should be "has amply been pointing" or similar. 

The text also has some misspellings: "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admir[ing]", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "am beatiful" instead of "a beautiful", "evidently not a Lo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and the place that answers that description". The "Lo here" and "Lo there" might be intentional references to biblical phrases, but the surrounding structure is confusing. 

There are also instances of incorrect verb forms, like "should was sought" instead of "should be sought", and "we should was so very grateful" (though that part isn't in the text). 

The author uses a lot of passive voice and complex sentence structures that make the text hard to follow. For example: "The scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand," – the comma after "outlined" is misplaced. 

Looking at the overall structure, the text is a series of paragraphs without clear transitions. Each paragraph jumps from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the argument. There's also repetition of ideas and phrases, which can be distracting. 

I also notice some inconsistencies in capitalization and punctuation, like "THE AUTHOR." at the end of a section, which is not standard in modern writing. 

The text includes some archaic or overly formal language that might be expected in older texts, but the grammar issues and awkward phrasing make it less fluent. There are also some logical leaps that aren't well-supported, which might affect clarity but are more about content than fluency. 

In summary, the main fluency issues are grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, tense, prepositions), spelling mistakes, awkward sentence structures, run-on sentences, and inconsistent punctuation. These issues make the text harder to read and understand, though the content is still somewhat coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "he simply stated... and give").  
- [SPELLING] Misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or run-on sentences (e.g., "by degrees it has been opened to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent").  
- [LEXICON] Misused or archaic phrasing (e.g., "the finger of time has am plainly pointing").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., comma splices, misplaced commas).  
- [COHESION] Repetitive and disjointed transitions between ideas.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5  
The text is marred by frequent grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward phrasing, which disrupt readability. While some passages are coherent, the overall structure and clarity are significantly impaired by these issues.
