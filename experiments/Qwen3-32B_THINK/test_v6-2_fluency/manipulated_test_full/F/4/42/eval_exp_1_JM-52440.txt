Let me evaluate the text for fluency according to the provided criteria.

First, I'll carefully read through the text and identify any fluency issues that would lead to a point deduction. The text appears to be a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England, written in a formal, somewhat archaic style.

Looking for fluency issues:
1. Grammar issues: I notice some grammatical errors in the text.
2. Syntax issues: There are some awkward or unclear sentence structures.
3. Spelling issues: I see some spelling errors.
4. Lexical issues: There are some odd word choices or misused words.
5. Punctuation issues: Some sentences have questionable punctuation.

Let me identify and categorize the most significant fluency issues:

[GRAMMAR] "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue..." - This appears to be a subject-verb agreement error. It should be "In doing this" instead of "In did this."

[GRAMMAR] "we was taught by our Lord Himself" - Subject-verb agreement error. It should be "we were taught."

[GRAMMAR] "we was taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life: ‘Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.’" - Subject-verb agreement error. "was" should be "were."

[GRAMMAR] "that the bread and wine cease to was bread and wine" - Verb form error. "was" should be "be."

[GRAMMAR] "that they was solemnly set apart" - Subject-verb agreement error. "was" should be "were."

[GRAMMAR] "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." - Subject-verb agreement error. "is" should be "are" to match "means."

[GRAMMAR] "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." - Subject-verb agreement error. "is" should be "are" to match "means."

[GRAMMAR] "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." - Subject-verb agreement error. "is" should be "are" to match "means."

[GRAMMAR] "It was nowhere said to be change into regeneration." - Verb form error. "change" should be "changed."

[GRAMMAR] "The water is sanctify" - Verb form error. "sanctify" should be "sanctified."

[GRAMMAR] "The new birth was not in the water" - Verb tense error. "was" should be "is."

[GRAMMAR] "I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles, but I am persuaded he will gain nothing by directing it to the Catechism." - The structure is awkward and unclear.

[GRAMMAR] "It was difficult to imagine a clearer and more marked distinction than that expressed in the second and third questions" - Subject-verb agreement issue. "was" should be "is."

[GRAMMAR] "It was difficult to imagine a clearer and more marked distinction than that expressed in the second and third questions" - Subject-verb agreement issue. "was" should be "is."

[GRAMMAR] "But it is headed with the words, ‘Of the wicked which ate not the body of Christ.’" - "ate" should be "eat" to match the present tense of the article.

[GRAMMAR] "But if there were any room for doubt as to the meaning of the Church of England in this passage, it would surely be removed by the next question and answer, ‘What are the benefits whereof we are partakers thereby?’" - Subject-verb agreement issue. "are" should be "is" to match "passage."

[GRAMMAR] "The outward is for the body, and strengthens it; the inward for the soul, and does the same for it." - Subject-verb agreement issue. "is" should be "are" to match "outward and inward."

[GRAMMAR] "The one is external, to be received into the body by bodily organization; the other is internal and invisible, received into the soul by faith." - Subject-verb agreement issue. "is" should be "are" to match "one" and "other."

[GRAMMAR] "But there is yet another most important document, and one inexpressibly precious to the heart of every devout communicant amongst us: I mean the Communion Service, or ‘Order of Administration of the Lord’s Supper, or Holy Communion.’" - The structure is awkward and the punctuation is problematic.

[GRAMMAR] "In the first book the words were: ‘Grant us, therefore, gracious Lord, so to ate the flesh of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drank His blood in these Holy Mysteries.’" - Verb form errors: "ate" should be "eat" and "drank" should be "drink."
