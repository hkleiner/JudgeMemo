Alright, let's dive into evaluating the fluency of this text. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want me to assess the fluency of the provided text based on the given criteria and scale. The text is an analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," written in a scholarly tone.

Starting with the first step: detect fluency problems. I'll need to look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, and any issues with clarity or adherence to common English usage. Let me go through the text systematically.

First, I notice that the text is written in a formal, academic style, which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, there are a few places where the sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, in the introduction, there's a sentence that starts with "FORSTER told us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" The use of all caps for "FORSTER" is inconsistent with the rest of the text, which uses standard capitalization. That's a formatting issue, but since the user is focusing on fluency, maybe it's a minor point.

Looking for grammatical errors: I see a few instances where the verb tenses or subject-verb agreement might be off. For example, in the sentence "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises." The verb "constructed" is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit abrupt. However, that's more about style than fluency. 

There's a part where the text says "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_." The phrase "in not unpleasant contrast" is a bit awkward. It could be rephrased to "in a not unpleasant contrast" for better fluency.

Another example is "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret." The repetition of "the secret" is noticeable. Maybe "the secret that excites curiosity and the game of hide and seek..." would be smoother.

Looking for repetition: The text uses phrases like "the reader" and "the reader who" multiple times, which could be varied for better fluency. For instance, "the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret" could be "the reader attempting to anticipate the solution."

There are also instances where the sentence structure is passive, which might affect the flow. For example, "He was more and more drawn towards the secret..." The passive voice is acceptable in academic writing, but it's worth noting if it affects clarity.

Another point is the use of hyphens and em dashes. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The em dash here is correctly used, but the sentence is long and might benefit from a period for clarity.

Looking for awkward phrasing: "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret." The phrase "the solution of the secret" is a bit awkward. It might be better as "the solution to the secret."

There's also a sentence that starts with "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers." The colon usage here is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and could be split for better readability.

Now, checking for grammatical errors: I notice "he coulded compensate" in the sentence "No sedulous care coulded compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”" The verb "coulded" is incorrect. It should be "could compensate." That's a clear grammatical error affecting fluency.

Another example is "he might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires." The phrase "might have go" is incorrect. It should be "might have gone."

Looking at the rest of the text, there's a sentence that says "He had lustrous thick black whiskers." The adjectives "lustrous thick black" are in the wrong order. It should be "thick, lustrous black whiskers."

There's also a sentence with "he would had been detected in real life, of course, but we allow for the accepted fictitious convention of successful disguise." The phrase "would had" is incorrect. It should be "would have been."

Another issue is the use of "am" in "Many efforts have am made to decipher his purpose." It should be "have been made."

In the section "We had am told that, shortly before Christmas Eve, Jasper took to wearing a thick black-silk handkerchief for his throat." The phrase "had am told" is incorrect. It should be "had been told."

Looking for other grammatical issues: "He was to had been detected" should be "He would have been detected."

The text also has some instances of inconsistent verb tenses. For example, "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret." The verb "excites" is present tense, while "tried" is past tense. This inconsistency might confuse the reader.

Another example is "He had lustrous thick black whiskers." The adjectives should be in the correct order for clarity.

The sentence structure in some parts is quite complex, which might affect readability. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The sentence is long and could be split into two for better flow.

There are also some instances of passive voice that might be better as active voice for clarity. For example, "He was more and more drawn towards the secret..." could be rephrased as "He became increasingly drawn towards the secret..."

In terms of repetition, the text uses "the secret" multiple times in close proximity, which could be varied for better fluency.

Now, summarizing the detected fluency problems:

1. Grammatical errors: "coulded," "would had," "had am told," incorrect adjective order.
2. Awkward phrasing: "the solution of the secret," "in not unpleasant contrast," "the reader who tried to anticipate."
3. Repetition of phrases like "the secret."
4. Inconsistent verb tenses.
5. Long, complex sentences that could be split for clarity.

Considering the evaluation criteria, the text has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but overall, it's mostly fluent. The errors are not so frequent as to make the text difficult to understand, but they do distract from the readability. The score would likely be a 3 or 3.5, but I need to check the scale again.

The scale says:
- 5: Highly fluent, minimal to no errors.
- 4: Mostly fluent, minor issues.
- 3: Generally readable but multiple issues.
- 2: Frequent errors, comprehension difficult.
- 1: Largely unintelligible.

Given the issues I found, there are multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow. However, the text is still generally understandable. So, a score of 3 seems appropriate. The errors are noticeable and affect fluency, but the overall meaning is clear.
