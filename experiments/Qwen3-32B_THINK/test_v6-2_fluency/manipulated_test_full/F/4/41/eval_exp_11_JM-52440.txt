Okay, let's start by reading through the text to understand the main points and identify any fluency issues. The text is a theological discussion about the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite long and detailed, referencing various articles, the Catechism, the Communion Service, and Homilies.

First, I'll look for any obvious issues like spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing. The title has some typos: "Doctrune" should be "Doctrine" and "Taughtvby" should be "Taught by". There's also a missing article in the title. 

Looking at the first paragraph, the word "ans" is used instead of "and". There's a typo in "vlindly" which should be "blindly". The word "experiejced" is misspelled as "experiejced" (should be "experienced"). 

In the section about the Catechism, "qustions" is misspelled as "questions". The word "gajn" should be "gain". There's a typo in "ifbthe" which is "if the". 

In the Communion Service section, there's a typo in "prayer book of 1552" where "1552" is written as "1552". Also, "prayer book" is sometimes written as "Prayer Book" inconsistently. 

The Homilies section has a typo in "yhose" which should be "those". In the section about adoration, "adodation" is a typo for "adoration". 

Looking at the Sacrifice chapter, there's a typo in "tyink" which should be "think". The word "v" in "Ousey" is likely a typo for "Pusey". 

There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, like missing commas, periods, or incorrect apostrophes. For example, "The Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experiejced" should have a comma after "experiejced". 

Some sentences are run-on or have awkward structure. For example, "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" could be split into two sentences for clarity. 

There are also some instances of inconsistent capitalization. For example, "the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies" should all be capitalized as they are proper nouns. 

Repetition is another issue. The word "Church" is repeated multiple times in close proximity, which could be rephrased for better flow. 

Some phrases are awkward or confusing. For instance, "It is my own belief that they do not; but yhat is not the present question." The word "yhat" is a typo for "that". 

The text also has some missing words or incorrect word order. For example, "The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner" should be "after a heavenly and spiritual manner". 

There are some instances where the author uses contractions in a way that might be inappropriate for formal writing, like "it's" instead of "it is", but this isn't a major issue. 

Overall, while the text is well-structured and the arguments are logical, the numerous typos, spelling errors, and grammatical issues affect the fluency. However, these issues don't completely hinder understanding, so the score should be in the middle range.
