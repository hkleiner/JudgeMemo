After reviewing the text, I've identified several fluency issues:

1) [SYNTAX] "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" - This sentence has awkward syntax with the placement of quotation marks and the use of "this essential of his art" which is unclear.

2) [GRAMMAR] "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world “have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,” elaborate construction is not absolutely “essential.”" - The comma after "think" is unnecessary, and the sentence structure is awkward.

3) [SYNTAX] "Really essential are character, “atmosphere,” humour." - The word order is awkward and unnatural in English.

4) [GRAMMAR] "But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of “hab nab at a venture.”" - This long sentence is difficult to follow and has awkward phrasing.

5) [SYNTAX] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." - This sentence is awkwardly structured and hard to follow.

6) [GRAMMAR] "Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales rivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as _Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_." - The placement of the book titles is awkward and the sentence structure is unclear.

7) [SYNTAX] "“Youth will be served;” no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”" - The sentence is awkwardly constructed and the meaning is unclear.

8) [GRAMMAR] "In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of Ralph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the innumerable attractions." - The subject-verb agreement is incorrect.

9) [SYNTAX] "But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed with repetition of the word "secret."

10) [GRAMMAR] "He therefore abandoned a new series of Readings." - The verb "abandoned" is used in a strange way here.

11) [SYNTAX] "We may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour." - The sentence is awkwardly structured.

12) [GRAMMAR] "“The Billickin,” on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is “in very gracious fooling:” her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss Twinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises." - The sentence has awkward punctuation and structure.

13) [SYNTAX] "Mr. Grewgious may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_." - This sentence is difficult to follow and has awkward phrasing.

14) [GRAMMAR] "Opinions may differ as to Edwin and Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks of that character." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

15) [SYNTAX] "As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the restraint which she puts on her “tigerish blood” is admirable: she is very fresh and original." - The sentence is awkwardly structured.

16) [GRAMMAR] "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the “atmosphere” of a small cathedral town." - The sentence has awkward phrasing and structure.

17) [SYNTAX] "Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the other hand, the opium den is studied from the life." - The sentence is awkwardly structured.

18) [GRAMMAR] "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers." - The sentence has awkward punctuation and structure.

19) [SYNTAX] "Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving three completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle to the curious." - The sentence is awkwardly structured.

20) [GRAMMAR] "Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose, especially his intentions as to the hero." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

21) [SYNTAX] "Was Edwin Drood killed, or did he escape?" - This is a good question, but the structure is slightly awkward.

22) [GRAMMAR] "By a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late Lord Lytton’s tale for _All The Year Round_, “The Disappearance of John Ackland,” for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland was alive or dead." - This long sentence has awkward phrasing.

23) [SYNTAX] "But he was conspicuously defunct! (_All the Year Round_, September-October, 1869.)" - The sentence is awkwardly structured.

24) [GRAMMAR] "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is “Watched by the Dead,” by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

25) [SYNTAX] "This book, to which I owe much aid, is now out of print." - The sentence is awkwardly structured.

26) [GRAMMAR] "In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived “the auld mysterie,” in his “Clues to Dickens’s Edwin Drood” (Chapman & Hall and Heywood, Manchester)." - The sentence has awkward phrasing.

27) [SYNTAX] "From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to dissent. Of Mr. Proctor’s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a state of tangle." - These sentences are awkwardly structured.

28) [GRAMMAR] "As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark seemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to understand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper’s babblings under the influence of opium." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

29) [SYNTAX] "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.” We may be sure that he was to see “_that_” in real life." - This sentence has awkward structure and repetition.

30) [GRAMMAR] "We must remember that, according to Forster, “such was Dickens’s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism.”" - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

31) [SYNTAX] "His interest in such matters certainly peeps out in this novel—there are two specimens of the supernormal—and he may have gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires." - This sentence is awkwardly structured.

32) [GRAMMAR] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of “The Signalman” in _Mugby Junction_." - The sentence has awkward phrasing.

33) [SYNTAX] "With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens’s last plot. Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories." - The transition between these sentences is awkward.

34) [GRAMMAR] "ANDREW LANG." - The author's name is capitalized in an unusual way.

35) [SYNTAX] "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" - This is an unusual way to present the list of characters.
