Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. First, I'll go through it and look for any issues that might affect fluency. Let's start by reading through the text carefully.

The text is quite long and seems to be a historical or religious argument about the location of the Garden of Eden. The author is making a case for it being in the Mississippi River valley, particularly around La Crosse and Winona. 

First, I'll check for grammatical errors. I notice several instances where words are misspelled. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians." There's also "admirirg" which is likely "admiring." These spelling errors are [SPELLING] issues.

Next, syntax and sentence structure. The sentences are often very long and complex, making them hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The structure here is a bit awkward. Also, there are some run-on sentences that could be split into shorter ones for better readability. This is a [SYNTAX] issue.

Punctuation is another area. Commas are sometimes missing or overused. For instance, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The comma before "have ventured" is incorrect. Also, there are instances where semicolons or periods would be more appropriate. This is a [PUNCTUATION] issue.

There are some awkward phrasings and word choices. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'" uses "finger of time" in a way that's a bit unclear. Also, "the discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" has a misplaced comma. These are [LEXICON] and [SYNTAX] issues.

Repetition is also a problem. The phrase "Come and see!" is repeated multiple times, which might be intentional for emphasis, but it can become distracting. This is a [REPETITION] issue.

The text uses some archaic or old-fashioned language that might not be common in modern writing, like "the one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in the world." While not incorrect, it can affect fluency for modern readers. This is a [STYLE] issue.

There are also some inconsistencies in capitalization and the use of italics. For example, "Euphrates" is capitalized when it's used metaphorically, which might be inconsistent with standard usage. This is a [STYLE] issue.

I also notice some missing or incorrect prepositions. For example, "the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead'" should be "principle of 'first know that you are right, then go ahead.'" This is a [SYNTAX] issue.

There are a few instances where the author uses terms that are not clearly defined, such as "the hanging garden," which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context. This is a [CLARITY] issue.

Lastly, the text has some run-on sentences that could be broken into shorter ones for better readability. For example, the sentence starting with "The river here, as in most places, has three banks..." is quite long and could be split. This is a [SYNTAX] issue.

Putting it all together, the main fluency issues are spelling, syntax, punctuation, repetition, and clarity. The text has enough of these issues to affect readability but is still generally understandable. I would rate it a 3 because while it's mostly readable, the multiple grammatical and structural problems interrupt the flow and clarity.
