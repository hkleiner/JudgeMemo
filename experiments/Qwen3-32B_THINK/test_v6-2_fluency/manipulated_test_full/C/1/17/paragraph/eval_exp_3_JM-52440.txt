I need to carefully evaluate the fluency of the given text. Let me first read through it to identify any issues with grammar, syntax, or clarity that might affect its fluency.

After reading through the text, I notice several issues that impact fluency:

1) Some sentences are extremely long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example: "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question. My present concern is with the fact that, however we explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life: 'Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.'"

2) There are some grammatical issues with subject-verb agreement and sentence structure. For example: "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined."

3) Some punctuation is missing or misused, particularly in complex sentences and lists.

4) There are some awkward phrasings and word choices that make the text less natural. For example: "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof."

5) There are some inconsistencies in the use of quotation marks and italics.

6) There are a few instances where the text appears to have been interrupted or where sentences don't flow smoothly from one to the next.

7) There are some run-on sentences that should be divided for clarity.

8) The text contains some archaic language and sentence structures that make it feel less modern and more difficult to read.

9) There are some missing articles or prepositions that make the text less fluent.

10) There are some instances of parallel structure issues in lists or comparisons.

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency of this text as a 3.5. The text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but it contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways. The issues I've identified are significant enough to affect fluency, but the text is still generally understandable and the author's meaning is clear.

Let me now summarize these issues in the required format.
