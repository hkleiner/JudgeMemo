Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to act as a human annotator and evaluate the story on fluency and coherence. I need to rate each on a scale from 1 to 5 and list specific issues with tags like [GRAMMAR], [SYNTAX], etc.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost," which is a well-known story by Oscar Wilde. The text here seems to be a slightly altered version, possibly with some errors introduced.

Starting with fluency. I'll check for sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The story has a lot of grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "every one tell him" should be "every one told him" [GRAMMAR]. Then, "when they come to discuss terms" should be "when they came" [GRAMMAR]. There are also issues with subject-verb agreement, like "the ghost has am see" which should be "the ghost has been seen" [GRAMMAR]. 

Looking at the rest, I notice several instances where past tense is used incorrectly. For example, "we'dded have it at home" should be "we'd have it at home" [GRAMMAR]. Also, "the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended" should be "the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended" [GRAMMAR]. 

There are also syntax issues. For example, "She had a magnificent constitution, and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English..." The sentence structure here is okay, but the use of "Indeed" might be a bit abrupt [TRANSITION]. 

Word choice and redundancy: "Mrs. Otis had never fallen into this error" – "error" here might be better as "mistake" [LEXICON]. Also, "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses" – "am" should be "are" [GRAMMAR]. 

Now for coherence. The story is about the Otis family moving into a haunted house. The flow between paragraphs is generally okay, but there are some logical jumps. For example, the transition from Mrs. Otis's description to her son Washington is smooth, but when moving to Virginia, the story jumps to her racing Lord Bilton and the Duke of Cheshire's proposal. This might be confusing for some readers [LOGIC]. 

The structure of the story is organized into chapters, which is good, but some sections feel a bit disjointed. For instance, the description of the twins as "The Star and Stripes" is a bit unclear without context [STRUCTURE]. Also, the sudden appearance of the ghost and the reaction of the family could be more smoothly connected [TRANSITION]. 

Clarity issues: "the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville" – the connection between the family doctor and Lord Canterville is unclear [CLARITY]. Also, "He have tried it with everything" should be "He had tried it with everything" [GRAMMAR]. 

Overall, the story has a lot of grammatical and syntactical errors that affect fluency. Coherence is somewhat maintained but has some logical gaps and unclear transitions. 

For the final scores, considering the number of grammar and syntax issues, fluency is probably a 2 or 3. Coherence, while not perfect, is better but still has some issues. I'll go with a 3 for fluency and a 3 for coherence.

The text contains several issues affecting fluency and coherence. Below are the identified problems and their classifications:

---

### **Fluency Issues**  
1. **[GRAMMAR]**: Multiple tense inconsistencies (e.g., "every one tell him" → "told him", "they come to discuss terms" → "came", "the ghost has am see" → "has been seen").  
2. **[GRAMMAR]**: Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the twins am usually called" → "are", "the laws of Nature are not went" → "are not going").  
3. **[GRAMMAR]**: Incorrect prepositions/phrasing (e.g., "we'dded have it at home" → "we’d have", "I will left it here" → "left").  
4. **[SYNTAX]**: Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the blood-stain has been much admire by tourists" → "admired", "Mrs. Otis fainted" → "fainted").  
5. **[LEXICON]**: Redundant or incorrect word choices (e.g., "we have really everything in common with America... except language" → "everything... except language" is redundant; "animal spirits" is archaic but not inherently incorrect).  

---

### **Coherence Issues**  
1. **[LOGIC]**: Confusing references (e.g., "the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville" lacks clarity about the connection between the doctor and Lord Canterville).  
2. **[STRUCTURE]**: Sudden shifts in focus (e.g., Virginia’s racing anecdote abruptly transitions to the Duke of Cheshire’s proposal without clear context).  
3. **[TRANSITION]**: Weak flow between paragraphs (e.g., the story moves from describing the house to the blood-stain incident without smooth transitions).  
4. **[CLARITY]**: Ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "the blood-stain has been much admire by tourists" → "admired" is needed for clarity; "Sir Simon de Canterville allude to in any way" → "alluded to" for coherence).  
5. **[LOGIC]**: Contradictory statements (e.g., the ghost’s reappearance after being "cleaned" by a detergent lacks a logical explanation, undermining the story’s internal logic).  

---

### **Final Scores**  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Fluency** suffers from frequent grammatical errors, inconsistent tenses, and awkward phrasing, making the text difficult to read smoothly.  
- **Coherence** is partially maintained through the narrative structure but is disrupted by logical gaps, abrupt transitions, and unclear references.
