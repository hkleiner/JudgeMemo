Alright, let's start by reading through the story carefully to understand its content and structure. The story is about the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden, claiming it to be located in the Mississippi River valley between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions to support this claim.

Now, I'll assess the fluency and coherence of the text, identifying specific issues that affect each aspect.
