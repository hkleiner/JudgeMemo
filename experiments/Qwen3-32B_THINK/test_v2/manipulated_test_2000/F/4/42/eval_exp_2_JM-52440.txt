Alright, I need to assess the fluency and coherence of the given text. Let me start by carefully reading through the story to understand its content and structure.

First, fluency. Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. I need to check for any issues like awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing sentences. 

Looking at the text, I notice several grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "is teach by the Church of England" should be "is taught by the Church of England" [GRAMMAR]. There's also "am the true expositors" which should be "are the true expositors" [GRAMMAR]. 

There are instances of incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. For example, "was the real point at issue" should be "is the real point at issue" [GRAMMAR]. Also, "But, I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranged the three principal points" should be "arranging" [GRAMMAR]. 

Punctuation is also an issue. Some sentences are missing commas or have incorrect punctuation. For example, "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;" should have a comma after "Scripture" [PUNCTUATION]. 

Word choice and redundancy are present as well. Phrases like "blind consent is blindly give" should be "blindly given" [LEXICON]. Also, "the point was supposed to had been settle by the Church" should be "had been settled" [GRAMMAR]. 

Moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and organization of ideas. The text seems to jump between ideas without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Church of England's doctrine, it suddenly shifts to discussing Rome's teachings without a clear connection [STRUCTURE]. 

There are also unclear connections between sentences. For instance, the transition from discussing the sacraments to the Articles of the Church is abrupt [TRANSITION]. Additionally, some ideas are introduced without sufficient explanation, making it hard to follow the argument [LOGIC]. 

The text could benefit from better organization of paragraphs and clearer transitions between sections. The conclusion of each section doesn't clearly lead into the next, causing the reader to lose track of the argument [STRUCTURE]. 

Overall, while the content is dense and the topic is complex, the text suffers from multiple grammatical and structural issues that affect both fluency and coherence.

[GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors, such as "am the true expositors" (should be "are"), "was the real point at issue" (should be "is"), and "the point was supposed to had been settle" (should be "had been settled").  
[GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense usage, e.g., "was not now making any assertion" (should be "am not now making").  
[GRAMMAR] Misuse of prepositions: "to was directed" (should be "to be directed"), "to was the sons of God" (should be "to be the sons of God").  
[GRAMMAR] Missing articles: "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time" (should be "a sifting time").  
[LEXICON] Redundant phrasing: "blind consent is blindly give" (should be "blindly given").  
[LEXICON] Ambiguous word choice: "the Church had made herself responsible" (unclear reference to "herself").  
[STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics, e.g., from discussing the Church of England to Romeâ€™s teachings without transitional context.  
[TRANSITION] Weak flow between paragraphs, such as the sudden jump from defining sacraments to analyzing specific Articles.  
[LOGIC] Unclear reasoning: "the practical conclusion is the same... Christ Himself is in the bread and wine" lacks explanation of how this aligns with prior distinctions.  
[CLARITY] Vague references: "these three I propose to investigate in that order" (no prior mention of "these three").  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
