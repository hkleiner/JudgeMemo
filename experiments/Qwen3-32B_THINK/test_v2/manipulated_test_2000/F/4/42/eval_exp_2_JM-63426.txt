Alright, let me start by carefully reading through the given story to understand its content and structure. The story is an introduction and chapter about Will Bradley, focusing on his life, career in graphic arts, and early years in Ishpeming. The text is quite lengthy and appears to be written in a somewhat formal, narrative style with some historical elements.

Now, I'll assess the story on the two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

**Fluency** refers to the readability, grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. I'll look for any issues with sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, or word choice that might make the text difficult to read.

**Coherence** refers to how well the ideas are organized and connected. I'll look at the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, the clarity of transitions, and whether the ideas build upon each other consistently.

Let me go through the text systematically to identify issues:

1. **Fluency Issues:**
   - [GRAMMAR] "It shoulded be talked about" - This is incorrect. The correct form should be "It should be talked about."
   - [GRAMMAR] "hard to realized" - The correct form should be "hard to realize."
   - [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may had had some" - This is a tense error. It should be "Bradley may have had some."
   - [GRAMMAR] "it don’t worked" - This is incorrect. The correct form should be "it didn't work."
   - [GRAMMAR] "he may had had some" - This is a tense error. It should be "he may have had some."
   - [GRAMMAR] "it don’t worked" - This is incorrect. The correct form should be "it didn't work."
   - [GRAMMAR] "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?" - This sentence has an unclear pronoun reference and a missing verb. It should be "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and who hasn't?"
   - [GRAMMAR] "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he take off into a career..." - The verb tense is inconsistent. It should be "he took off."
