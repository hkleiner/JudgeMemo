Alright, I need to evaluate the story on two dimensions: fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully and noting any issues.

**Fluency issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect. It appears to be a jumbled mess with no clear meaning.
2. [SYNTAX] "The cars steamboats trains drawings of sailboats: is, blackboard, covered, chalk houses with, ferryboats, people and animals." This sentence has awkward syntax with no clear subject-verb agreement or logical structure.
3. [GRAMMAR] "For each are five trip you paid cents." This sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing. It should probably be something like "You were paid five cents for each trip."
4. [GRAMMAR] "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
5. [GRAMMAR] "In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar "version old pretends." This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
6. [LEXICON] "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." This appears to be a jumbled version of "You don't like arithmetic anyway, do you?" which is a grammatically incorrect and awkward phrasing.
7. [SYNTAX] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window--where you can proudly wave to the schoolchildren as they are going home to their noon meal." This sentence has awkward syntax with an unclear subject.
8. [LEXICON] "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The phrase "working man--wages three dollars a week" is awkward and could be improved with a preposition like "with wages of three dollars a week."

**Coherence issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The story jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions. For example, it moves from Boston to Swampscott to Providence to Thompsonville to Ishpeming without explaining the connections between these places or the timeline.
2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is disjointed. It starts with an introduction about Will Bradley's impact on graphic arts, then shifts to a detailed biography of his childhood, then back to commentary on his career. This lack of consistent narrative focus makes the text feel fragmented.
3. [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts in perspective and topic. For example, the text moves from describing Bradley's childhood to discussing his later career impact without clear transitions.
4. [LOGIC] Some events are mentioned without sufficient context or explanation. For example, the lawsuit involving Theodore Roosevelt is mentioned without clarifying its relevance to the narrative.
5. [CLARITY] The text frequently uses vague or ambiguous phrasing. For example, "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater" is abstract and doesn't clearly explain what specific aspects of commercial life appealed to Bradley.
6. [LOGIC] The story sometimes introduces new ideas or events without connecting them to the previous content. For example, the detailed description of the printing press and newspaper work in Ishpeming appears without clear connection to the earlier narrative about Bradley's childhood in Boston.
7. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end structure. It starts with an introduction about Bradley's impact, then shifts to a detailed biography, and ends with a return to commentary on his legacy without a clear narrative arc.

Based on these observations, I would rate the story as follows:

- **Fluency Score:** 2/5. The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and confusing phrasing that significantly affect readability.
- **Coherence Score:** 2/5. The narrative is disjointed with abrupt shifts in time and location, unclear transitions, and a lack of consistent focus that makes it difficult to follow the overall story.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Identified:**  

1. [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." – This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.  
2. [SYNTAX] "The cars steamboats trains drawings of sailboats: is, blackboard, covered, chalk houses with, ferryboats, people and animals." – Awkward syntax with no clear structure or subject-verb agreement.  
3. [GRAMMAR] "For each are five trip you paid cents." – Incorrect phrasing; likely intended as "You were paid five cents for each trip."  
4. [GRAMMAR] "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." – Incoherent and grammatically flawed.  
5. [GRAMMAR] "In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar "version old pretends." – Unintelligible and grammatically incorrect.  
6. [LEXICON] "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." – Jumbled phrasing; likely "You don’t like arithmetic anyway, do you?"  
7. [SYNTAX] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." – Awkward syntax with unclear subject.  
8. [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between time periods and locations (e.g., Boston to Swampscott to Ishpeming) without clear transitions.  
9. [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative structure, moving from an introduction on Bradley’s legacy to his childhood and back without a cohesive arc.  
10. [TRANSITION] Missing flow between sections, such as the sudden shift from childhood anecdotes to legal history involving Theodore Roosevelt.  
11. [CLARITY] Vague phrasing like "the turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life" lacks specificity.  
12. [LOGIC] Unconnected details, such as the printing press descriptions, are introduced without contextual links to earlier content.
