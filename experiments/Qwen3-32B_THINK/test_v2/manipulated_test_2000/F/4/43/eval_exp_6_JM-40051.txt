Okay, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given text. First, I need to understand what the story is about. The title mentions the Garden of Eden being found in a specific location in the US. The author seems to be presenting a discovery, using biblical references and geographical descriptions to support the claim.

Starting with fluency. I'll check for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. The first thing I notice is that the text has some odd capitalization, like "Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT," which might be a typo or formatting issue. There are also some run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow. 

There are several instances of incorrect grammar, like "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." The sentence structure here is awkward. Also, there are typos such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admiring." These affect fluency because they make the text harder to read.

Looking at sentence construction, some sentences are too long and lack proper punctuation. For example, "Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed..." This could be broken into shorter sentences for better readability. 

Word choice and redundancy are also issues. The author uses phrases like "most industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people," which is a bit redundant. Also, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" is a bit awkward. There's some repetition in the arguments made, which could be streamlined.

Now for coherence. The story attempts to connect biblical descriptions of Eden with a specific geographical location in the US. However, the flow between ideas is sometimes abrupt. The author jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the location of Eden, the text suddenly starts talking about the Mississippi River and its banks without a smooth transition. 

There are also logical gaps. The author makes claims without sufficient evidence, such as equating the Mississippi with the Euphrates. The connection between the biblical references and the geographical features is made but not thoroughly explained, leaving some reasoning gaps. 

The structure of the text is a bit disorganized. The story starts with the author's discovery, then goes into biblical context, then into geographical descriptions, and then back to the author's claims. There's a lack of clear organization, making it hard to follow the argument. 

There's a section with a jumbled sentence that's almost unreadable: "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to, Trempealeau..." This severely affects coherence because it's confusing and doesn't convey any clear information.

Transitions between paragraphs are weak. The author moves from one idea to the next without clear connectors, making the flow choppy. For example, after discussing the hanging garden, the text abruptly shifts to discussing rattlesnakes without explaining the connection to the main argument.

Overall, the text has a lot of issues with both fluency and coherence. The grammar and punctuation errors make it hard to read, and the lack of logical flow and organization makes the argument difficult to follow. The author's claims are presented but not effectively supported or structured in a way that's easy to understand.

[GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as "antldiluvians" (misspelled "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (misspelled "admiring"), and incorrect punctuation in run-on sentences like "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared..."  
[SYNTAX] Sentence fragments and overly long, unstructured sentences disrupt readability, e.g., "Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth..." lacks clear breaks.  
[LEXICON] Redundant phrases like "most industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people" and awkward word choices like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" reduce clarity.  
[LOGIC] The argument connecting biblical Eden to the Mississippi River is underdeveloped, with unexplained leaps (e.g., equating "Euphrates" with "Mississippi") and unsupported claims.  
[STRUCTURE] The text lacks cohesive organization; ideas jump abruptly between biblical references, geographical descriptions, and the author’s claims without logical flow.  
[CLARITY] Vague or ambiguous phrasing, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing," and unclear references (e.g., "our garden") weaken the argument.  
[TRANSITION] Weak or missing transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifting from biblical context to rattlesnakes) create disjointedness.  

**Jumbled, unreadable sentence**:  
[Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river “below greed,” on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to, Trempealeau...] This severely disrupts coherence and fluency.
