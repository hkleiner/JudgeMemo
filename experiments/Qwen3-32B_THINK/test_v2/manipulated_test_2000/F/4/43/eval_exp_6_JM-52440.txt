Alright, let's start by reading the story carefully. The text is about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's a theological discussion, so the language is formal and dense with religious terminology. 

First, I'll check for fluency. Fluency involves clarity, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. I notice that the sentences are often long and complex. For example, "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined." This sentence is quite lengthy and might be difficult to follow without commas or breaks. There are also some grammatical issues, like "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This part is incoherent and seems to be a run-on or a typo.

Next, coherence. The text is supposed to be a structured argument about the Church of England's doctrine. However, the flow between ideas isn't always smooth. For example, after discussing the sacraments, the article jumps into specific points without clear transitions. Also, some paragraphs start with new ideas without linking back to the previous content. There's a lack of clear transitions between sections, making it hard to follow the argument's progression. Additionally, the text sometimes uses jargon without explanation, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with theological terms.

Looking at specific issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors, like "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This seems like a typo or a misplaced sentence fragment.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, making it hard to follow. For example, the long introductory sentence in the first chapter is difficult to parse.
- [LOGIC] Some arguments jump between points without clear connections. For instance, moving from discussing the sacraments to the Articles without a smooth transition.
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks clear transitions between paragraphs and sections, making the flow of ideas abrupt.
- [CLARITY] The use of theological jargon without explanation can make the text unclear to a general audience. Terms like "Real Presence," "Adoration," and "Sacrifice" are mentioned without sufficient context.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure could be improved with clearer headings or subheadings to guide the reader through the argument.

In terms of fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which would lower the fluency score. For coherence, the lack of clear transitions and logical flow between ideas would also lower the score. However, the text does maintain a consistent argument about the Church of England's doctrine, which is a positive aspect for coherence. The main issues are the structural and transitional problems, along with the grammatical errors affecting fluency.

The story is a dense theological treatise discussing the Church of England’s stance on the Lord’s Supper, with a focus on the "Real Presence" doctrine. Below are the issues affecting fluency and coherence:  

### Fluency Issues:  
1. **[SYNTAX]** Overly complex and convoluted sentence structures, such as:  
   *“The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined.”*  
   These sentences are difficult to parse due to excessive subordination and lack of punctuation breaks.  

2. **[GRAMMAR]** Multiple grammatical errors and fragmented phrases, such as:  
   *“That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.”*  
   This appears to be a typographical or formatting error, rendering the text nonsensical.  

3. **[LEXICON]** Redundant phrasing and word choice, such as repeated use of “sacrament,” “Church,” and “presence” without variation, which weakens readability.  

### Coherence Issues:  
1. **[STRUCTURE]** Poor organization of ideas. The text transitions abruptly between theological arguments, scriptural references, and critiques of the Church of England, with no clear subheadings or logical flow. For example, the discussion of the Articles (25–31) begins without clarifying how they relate to prior claims.  

2. **[TRANSITION]** Missing or weak transitions between paragraphs. The shift from discussing the sacraments’ general definition to the specific case of baptism is jarring, with no explanatory links.  

3. **[LOGIC]** Reasoning gaps. The argument relies heavily on assertions (e.g., “It is my belief that they do not [refer to the Sacrament]”) without addressing counterarguments or providing evidence, weakening the coherence of the central thesis.  

4. **[CLARITY]** Overuse of jargon (e.g., “Real Objective Presence,” “κοινωνία”) without definitions, making the text inaccessible to readers unfamiliar with theological terminology.  

### Final Scores:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
