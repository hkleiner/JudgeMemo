Alright, let me start by reading through the provided story carefully to understand its content and structure. The story is titled "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden" and is written in a somewhat archaic and verbose style. The author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, drawing parallels between geographical features and biblical descriptions.

Now, I'll assess the fluency and coherence of the text, identifying issues along the way.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] - There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "dkscovered," "antldiluvians," "princopak," "locayion," "cohsequently," "thr," "prlper dimentions," "investigatikn," etc. These errors disrupt the readability of the text.

2. [SYNTAX] - The sentence structure is often convoluted and difficult to follow. For example, "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery" has an awkward construction.

3. [LEXICON] - The word choice is sometimes redundant or imprecise. For example, "very slow in making public the results of my discovery" could be more clearly expressed.

4. [GRAMMAR] - There are missing or incorrect punctuation marks. For example, "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it" lacks a subject after the comma.

5. [SYNTAX] - Some sentences are run-on or contain unnecessary complexity, making them hard to parse. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere" is unnecessarily wordy.

6. [GRAMMAR] - There are subject-verb agreement issues, such as "he simply stated the princopak facts" where "princopak" is a misspelling of "principal."

7. [LEXICON] - The author uses some archaic or overly formal language that doesn't flow naturally with the rest of the text.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] - The logical flow of the argument is sometimes unclear. The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's location but doesn't always connect these claims logically to the evidence presented.

2. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear organizational structure. It jumps between different ideas without clear transitions or signposts.

3. [TRANSITION] - The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt or missing. For example, the text moves from a discussion about the Garden of Eden to specific geographical features without clear connections.

4. [LOGIC] - Some of the reasoning is circular or self-referential. The author claims to have found the Garden of Eden because the location fits the biblical description, but this is used as the main evidence for the claim.

5. [CLARITY] - The text contains vague or ambiguous references that make it difficult to follow the author's argument. For example, "our garden is still in the right plafe" is unclear.

6. [LOGIC] - The author makes comparisons between the geographical features and biblical descriptions that are not always convincing or logically sound.

7. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks clear sectioning or headings that would help organize the content and guide the reader through the author's argument.

After evaluating these issues, I'll now provide my ratings:

**Fluency Score:** 2 (The text has significant issues with grammar, spelling, and syntax that make it difficult to read and understand. The convoluted sentence structures and frequent errors severely impact the overall fluency.)

**Coherence Score:** 2 (The text lacks a clear logical flow and organizational structure. The author's arguments are not well connected, and the text jumps between ideas without clear transitions. The reasoning is often circular or based on weak connections between the evidence and the claims.)

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] - The text contains numerous spelling errors (e.g., "dkscovered," "antldiluvians," "princopak," "locayion," "thr," "prlper dimentions," "investigatikn"). These errors disrupt readability and comprehension.  
2. [SYNTAX] - Sentences are often convoluted or awkwardly constructed. For example: "On the principle of ‘first know you are right, then go ahead,’ I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery" lacks clarity and natural flow.  
3. [LEXICON] - Redundant or imprecise word choices (e.g., "very slow in making public the results of my discovery") weaken the text’s fluency.  
4. [GRAMMAR] - Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it") creates confusion.  
5. [SYNTAX] - Run-on sentences and overly complex phrasing (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere") hinder readability.  
6. [GRAMMAR] - Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "he simply stated the princopak facts") further disrupt fluency.  
7. [LEXICON] - Archaic or inconsistent language (e.g., "pleasantry," "thoroughly satisfied") clashes with the modern reader’s expectations.  

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] - The argument lacks logical progression. The author asserts the Garden of Eden is in the U.S. but fails to connect evidence (e.g., geographical features) to biblical descriptions persuasively.  
2. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks clear organization. Ideas jump abruptly from theological speculation to geographical claims without transitions.  
3. [TRANSITION] - Missing or weak transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from biblical analysis to descriptions of the Mississippi River) create disjointedness.  
4. [LOGIC] - Reasoning is circular. For example, the author claims the location fits the biblical description *because* it matches their interpretation, without independent validation.  
5. [CLARITY] - Ambiguous references (e.g., "our garden is still in the right plafe") and vague assertions (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing") confuse the reader.  
6. [LOGIC] - Comparisons between the text’s "garden" and biblical Eden are superficial (e.g., "three lesser rivers run through and water this garden") without deeper analysis.  
7. [STRUCTURE] - The absence of clear sectioning or headings (e.g., for geographical descriptions vs. theological claims) makes the argument hard to follow.  

**Final Scores:**  
FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
