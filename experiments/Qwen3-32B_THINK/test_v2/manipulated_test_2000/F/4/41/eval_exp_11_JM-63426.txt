Okay, I'm going to evaluate the given story text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to understand its content and structure.

First, I'll assess fluency, which relates to the text's clarity and readability in terms of grammar, punctuation, word choice, and sentence construction.

I notice several issues with grammar and punctuation:
- "before I had seem the book’s text itself" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "seen")
- "stuffy toom Bradley entered" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "room")
- "werebknown to a few connoisseurs" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "were known")
- "There werecderivative traces" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "There were derivative")
- "emriched our arts" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "enriched")
- "schoolhouse om Baltimore Street im Lynn" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "on" and "in")
- "blackboard is coveref with chalk drawings" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "covered")
- "employees wre all natives" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "were")
- "rethrn with a supply of unfinished" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "return")
- "five cemts" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "cents")
- "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" - [GRAMMAR] (awkward phrasing)
- "you have been a good boy and that shen you grow up" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "when")
- "qant to be an artist" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "want")
- "Youngo to Fisherman’s Beach" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "Young, go to")
- "ade now quite grown up" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "are now quite grown up")
- "toing back to Bkston" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "going back to Boston")
- "wzit for you" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "wait")
- "cTeacher xays" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "Your teacher says")
- "art esucation" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "art education")
- "haviny trouble" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "having")
- "cTeacher xays" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "teacher says")
- "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway" - [GRAMMAR] (awkward phrasing)
- "You are put ro work washing-up a Gordon press" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "put to work washing up a Gordon press")
- "a small engine mounted on an upright boioer" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "boiler")
- "the lay og a lower-case" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "the lay of a lower-case")
- "freauently" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "frequently")
- "prdss" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "press")
- "heated (?)" - [GRAMMAR] (question mark seems misplaced)
- "boardcand buying your clothes" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "board and buying")
- "advance isbalways heralded" - [GRAMMAR] (should be "advance is always heralded")

For syntax and sentence construction:
- "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy toom Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." - [SYNTAX] (very long sentence with complex structure)
- "Morris failing to revive medievalism but startling his world with a revival of fine craftsmanship" - [SYNTAX] (awkward phrasing)
- "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." - [SYNTAX] (awkward phrasing)
- "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." - [SYNTAX] (awkward phrasing)

For word choice and redundancy:
- "romped like a breeze through American graphic arts" - [LEXICON] (unusual metaphor)
- "lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body" - [LEXICON] (awkward phrasing)
- "turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life" - [LEXICON] (awkward phrasing)
- "the fine, free-handed job they are doing" - [LEXICON] (awkward phrasing)
- "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, ismsitting on the platform" - [LEXICON] (awkward phrasing)

For clarity and ambiguity:
- "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body" - [CLARITY] (unclear reference to "body")
- "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" - [CLARITY] (awkward phrasing)
- "Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch" - [CLARITY] (unclear if this is a negative outcome)

For logical connections:
- "But still there is something to talk about that he, modest man, hasn’t even mentioned." - [LOGIC] (sudden shift in perspective)
- "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." - [LOGIC] (unclear connection to previous paragraph)
- "Now his retirement has lasted almost as long as his active career." - [LOGIC] (sudden shift in time)

For coherence and structure:
- The story jumps abruptly from the introduction to a detailed account of Will Bradley's childhood without clear transitions. - [STRUCTURE]
- The narrative shifts between different time periods and perspectives without clear markers. - [STRUCTURE]
- The story lacks a clear thesis or organizational pattern. - [STRUCTURE]
- The transition from the introduction to the biography is abrupt. - [TRANSITION]
- The shift from the introduction to the childhood narrative is jarring. - [TRANSITION]

Now, for coherence, I need to evaluate how well the ideas are organized and connected. 

The story has a clear narrative about Will Bradley's life and career, but it lacks a consistent organizational structure. The introduction is written as if it's a separate document from the biography that follows, with no clear connection between them. The narrative jumps abruptly from the introduction to the detailed account of Will Bradley's childhood without any transitional sentences.

The flow between paragraphs is often abrupt. For example, the introduction ends with a discussion of Bradley's impact on the arts, but the next paragraph begins with a scene in a schoolhouse in 1875 without any indication of the time jump or connection to the previous content.

There are also unresolved references and unclear connections between ideas. For instance, the introduction mentions Bradley's retirement lasting as long as his active career, but this is not elaborated upon in the subsequent narrative.

The overall structure lacks clear sections or chapters that would help organize the content. The story appears to be a collection of anecdotes and facts without a clear progression or development of ideas.

For fluency, the text has numerous grammatical and punctuation errors that disrupt the readability. The sentence structures are often complex and awkward, making the text difficult to follow. There are also many instances of word choice that seem unusual or inappropriate for the context.

Based on these observations, I would rate the story as follows:
- Coherence: I'll give it a 2 out of 5. The story has a clear subject (Will Bradley) and some chronological elements, but the organization is poor, with abrupt transitions and a lack of clear connections between ideas.
- Fluency: I'll give it a 2 out of 5. The text is filled with grammatical and punctuation errors, awkward phrasing, and unclear word choices that significantly impact readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

The story suffers from numerous grammatical and punctuation errors that significantly disrupt readability, including incorrect verb forms, misspellings, and awkward phrasing. For example:  
- [GRAMMAR] "before I had seem the book’s text" (should be "seen"), "stuffy toom Bradley entered" (should be "room"), and "werebknown to a few connoisseurs" (should be "were known").  
- [GRAMMAR] "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" (awkward phrasing), "You are put ro work washing-up a Gordon press" (should be "put to work washing up"), and "freauently" (should be "frequently").  

The narrative lacks logical flow and clear transitions between sections. The introduction abruptly shifts to a detailed account of Will Bradley's childhood without connecting the two parts, and the timeline jumps are unmarked. For example:  
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction discusses Bradley's career and impact, but the next chapter begins with a scene in 1875 without transitional context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the biography is jarring, with no indication of the time jump or connection between ideas.  

The text also contains unclear references and ambiguous phrasing that hinder understanding, such as:  
- [CLARITY] "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body" (unclear reference to "body"), "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" (awkward phrasing).  

The overall organization is disjointed, with abrupt shifts in perspective and no consistent thesis or structure to unify the content. The lack of clear connections between ideas and unresolved references further diminishes coherence.
