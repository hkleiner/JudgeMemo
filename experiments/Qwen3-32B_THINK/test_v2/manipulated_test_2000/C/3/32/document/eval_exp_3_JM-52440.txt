Alright, let's take a look at this story. First, I need to assess fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long and dense, but I need to check for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, "the documents of the stuff are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" – "the stuff" is unclear here. That's probably a placeholder or typo. [LEXICON]. Also, "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied..." – same issue with "a stuff". [LEXICON]. There are some missing articles or prepositions, like "the thing and the thing" which seems like a placeholder. [LEXICON]. 

Looking at sentence structure, some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard..." – the comma placement is a bit off. [SYNTAX]. Also, "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." – the repetition of "refer" is redundant. [REDUNDANCY]. 

Grammar-wise, "the documents of the stuff are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" – "the stuff" is unclear. [GRAMMAR]. Also, "the thing and the thing" – unclear antecedents. [GRAMMAR]. 

Now coherence. The text is about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The flow is logical in that it introduces the topic, discusses the Real Presence, and then moves to the Articles. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing the Real Presence, the text jumps to the Articles without clear transition. [TRANSITION]. Also, the use of "the thing" and "a thing" makes it hard to follow the argument. [CLARITY]. The structure is somewhat organized into chapters and sections, but the lack of clear transitions between sections might confuse readers. [STRUCTURE]. 

There are some logical gaps. For instance, the author mentions the Articles but doesn't clearly connect them back to the main argument about the Real Presence. [LOGIC]. Also, the repeated use of "stuff" and "thing" without explanation makes the argument less coherent. [CLARITY]. 

Overall, the fluency is affected by the unclear terms and awkward sentence structures, while coherence is impacted by the lack of clear transitions and logical connections between sections. The text is dense and academic, which might be expected, but the issues with clarity and structure reduce the overall quality.

**Issues Identified:**  

- [LEXICON] Repeated use of vague or placeholder terms like "the stuff," "a thing," and "the thing" without clear definitions, which hinders understanding.  
- [GRAMMAR] Unclear antecedents in phrases like "the documents of the stuff" and "the thing and the thing," creating ambiguity.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly long and complex sentences with awkward phrasing (e.g., "now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time...").  
- [CLARITY] Vague or repetitive references to "the thing" and "the stuff" without explanation, making the argument difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] Gaps in reasoning between sections (e.g., abrupt shifts from discussing the Real Presence to the Articles without clear transitional links).  
- [STRUCTURE] Weak organization between paragraphs, with some sections lacking logical flow (e.g., moving from the Real Presence to the Articles without a smooth transition).  
- [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitions between ideas (e.g., jumping from Scriptural analysis to the Church of England’s Articles without connecting the two).  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  

The text suffers from significant coherence issues due to unclear terms, logical gaps, and poor transitions. Fluency is also low due to awkward syntax, grammatical errors, and repetitive phrasing, which disrupt readability. While the content is dense and academic, the lack of clarity and structure severely limits its effectiveness.
