Alright, let's start by reading the story carefully to understand what it's about. The story is an introduction to Will Bradley's chap book, focusing on his impact on American graphic arts. It then transitions into a chapter about his early life as a boy printer in Ishpeming.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency relates to how smooth and readable the text is. I'll look for grammar issues, sentence structure problems, word choice, and punctuation. For example, if there are run-on sentences, awkward phrasing, or incorrect grammar, that would lower the fluency score.

Next, coherence. This is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. I need to check if the flow between paragraphs and sentences makes sense. Are there clear transitions? Do ideas build logically on each other? If there are abrupt shifts or unclear connections, that would affect coherence.

Starting with fluency. The first part of the story has some complex sentences but they generally read smoothly. However, there are instances of missing punctuation and awkward phrasing. For example, in the line "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The phrase "stir in its sleep" is a bit unclear and might be a metaphor, but it's a bit jarring. Also, "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams" is a vivid metaphor, but it's a bit over the top and could be confusing.

Looking at the second chapter, "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING," there are several instances of missing words or placeholders like "a thing" and "the thing." These are likely typos or formatting issues. For example, "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on Baltimore Street in a thing, Massachusetts, just outside Boston." The word "thing" here is a placeholder and doesn't make sense. Similarly, "Fisherman’s Beach and watch the fishermen take lobsters out of the boiling pot." The phrase "boiling pot" is a bit unclear, but maybe it's referring to a cooking pot. There's also a missing word in "You are now on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to a stuff." The word "stuff" is used as a placeholder, which is confusing.

In terms of grammar, there are a few instances of missing articles or incorrect prepositions. For example, "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The structure here is a bit abrupt. Also, "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid." The comma placement here is okay, but the sentence could be clearer if rephrased.

For coherence, the story transitions from an introduction about Bradley's impact on graphic arts to his early life. The transition is abrupt, and there's no clear connection between the two chapters. The first chapter is more about his influence and achievements, while the second chapter is a detailed narrative of his childhood. The lack of transition between these two parts affects coherence. Additionally, within the second chapter, there are some disjointed sections. For example, the story jumps from his early life to his work in the newspaper office without clear transitions. The mention of historical events like the trial involving Theodore Roosevelt is inserted without context, which could confuse readers.

Another issue is the use of placeholders like "a thing" and "the thing," which disrupt the flow and make the text incoherent. The reader is left wondering what these placeholders refer to, which breaks the immersion and understanding of the story.

In the first chapter, the author mentions "the impact of his work on his time" but doesn't clearly explain what this impact was, making the reasoning gap a problem. The author also compares Bradley to other artists like Morris and Beardsley but doesn't clearly establish the connection between Bradley's work and these influences, leading to a logic issue.

Overall, the text has some strong points in terms of vivid descriptions and historical context, but the fluency is hampered by awkward phrasing, missing words, and grammatical issues. The coherence is affected by abrupt transitions, unclear connections between ideas, and the use of placeholders that confuse the reader.

**Issues Identified:**  

- **[LEXICON]** Repeated use of "thing" as a placeholder (e.g., "in a thing, Massachusetts") and "stuff" (e.g., "on your way to a stuff") creates confusion and disrupts fluency.  
- **[GRAMMAR]** Missing articles or prepositions in phrases like "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week" (lacks "with" before "wages").  
- **[SYNTAX]** Awkward phrasing in "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye" (unclear metaphor).  
- **[CLARITY]** Ambiguous references like "the boiling pot" (likely "boiling pot of water," but unclear).  
- **[STRUCTURE]** Sudden shift between the introductory chapter on Bradley’s legacy and the second chapter about his childhood, with no transitional context.  
- **[LOGIC]** Jump from discussing Bradley’s influence to his early life without explaining how his upbringing shaped his career.  
- **[TRANSITION]** Abrupt transitions between paragraphs in the second chapter (e.g., from childhood memories to newspaper work without logical flow).  
- **[GRAMMAR]** Missing punctuation or incomplete sentences, such as "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget. Then he sends you out to play..." (lacks a transition between father’s death and departure).  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**
