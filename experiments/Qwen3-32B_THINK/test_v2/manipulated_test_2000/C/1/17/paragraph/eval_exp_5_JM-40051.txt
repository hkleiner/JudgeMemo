Alright, let me start by reading through the given story carefully. The story seems to be a mix of different narrative styles and topics. It starts with a discovery of the Garden of Eden, then shifts to a romantic conflict involving Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin. Later, it describes a visit to Canterville Chase and another office scene. There's also a part about serpents in the garden and a character named George Stransom.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency is about clarity, grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. Let me check for any obvious errors. The first paragraph has some awkward phrasing, like "have ventured to publish it." The sentence structure is a bit choppy. Then there's a mention of "antldiluvians" which I think should be "antediluvians." That's a spelling mistake. There are also some missing commas and periods, like in the line "And from thence,——it was which means long river..." The em dashes are used inconsistently. 

Looking at the section about Jasper and Rosa, the sentences are more structured but still have some issues. For example, "He makes her aware of his passion, silently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions private." The use of "silently" here is a bit unclear—does it mean he expresses his passion silently, or that he makes her aware silently? That's a clarity issue. Also, the transition from the Garden of Eden to the romantic conflict is abrupt. There's a sudden shift in the narrative, which might affect coherence.

In the Canterville Chase part, the sentences are well-structured, but the shift from the previous section is jarring. The same goes for the office scene at the end. The story seems to jump between different scenarios without clear transitions, making it hard to follow the overall narrative. 

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The story starts with the discovery of Eden, then moves to a romantic subplot, then to a visit to a house, and ends with an office scene. These sections don't seem to connect logically. The romantic conflict with Jasper and Rosa is introduced without context, and the transition to Canterville Chase is abrupt. The office scene at the end also seems disconnected from the previous parts. 

There are also some unresolved references. For example, in the section about Jasper, it's unclear how he fits into the Garden of Eden narrative. The mention of "Laughing" and "Father of Waters" as rivers in the Mississippi Valley is specific, but the connection to the Garden of Eden isn't clearly explained. The story seems to present a mix of different ideas without a unifying thread, which affects coherence.

Looking at specific issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in the first paragraph, like "have ventured to publish it."
- [LEXICON] "dimentions" should be "dimensions."
- [LOGIC] The shift from the Garden of Eden to the romantic conflict is abrupt and lacks explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different narratives without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] The line "He makes her aware of his passion, silently" is ambiguous.
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitions between the different narrative sections.

The fluency issues are moderate, with some grammar and spelling errors, but the main problem is the structure and transitions affecting coherence. The story's coherence is low because the different parts don't connect well, and the narrative jumps around without a clear flow. 

For fluency, I would rate it a 3 because while there are some errors, the text is mostly readable. Coherence is a 2 because the story lacks a clear structure and transitions, making it hard to follow the overall narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Identified:**  

- [GRAMMAR] Spelling errors: "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "consitutes" (should be "constitutes").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "have ventured to publish it" (missing subject).  
- [LEXICON] Redundant or unclear word choice: "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" (vague phrasing).  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between unrelated narratives (e.g., Garden of Eden claims to romantic conflict with Jasper/Rosa, then to Canterville Chase).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization: The text jumps between unrelated topics (biblical discovery, Victorian romance, Gothic house, office scene) without transitions or unifying themes.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references: "Our garden is still in the right place" (unclear what "right place" refers to).  
- [TRANSITION] Missing connections: The romantic subplot and Gothic house narrative are introduced abruptly, with no contextual links to the Eden claim.  

The text lacks coherence due to its fragmented structure and unrelated sections. Fluency is hindered by grammar errors and awkward phrasing, though the writing remains mostly readable.
