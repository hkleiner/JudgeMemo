Let me analyze the story for fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues.

First, I'll read through the story carefully to understand its content and structure.

This appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American graphic artist, focusing on his early life and career. The text has two main chapters: "An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The first chapter discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, while the second chapter details his childhood and early career.

Now, let me assess the fluency:

Fluency refers to the text's clarity and readability, considering sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

Issues I notice regarding fluency:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are several missing articles and possessive forms. For example, "I agreed to write an introduction to Will Bradley, His Chap Book" should be "Will Bradley's Chap Book."
2. [GRAMMAR] The text has inconsistent capitalization of the first word in sentences after line breaks. For example, "But still there is something to talk about..." should not have "But" capitalized if it's the continuation of a sentence.
3. [GRAMMAR] The phrase "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye" has awkward phrasing.
4. [LEXICON] The word "Nineties" is not capitalized, which is inconsistent with the capitalization of other decades like "’85" in the second chapter.
5. [GRAMMAR] The text has some missing commas that would help with readability, such as in "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too."
6. [SYNTAX] There are a few instances of run-on sentences, such as "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."
7. [GRAMMAR] The phrase "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work" has a missing comma after "Press."
8. [GRAMMAR] The text has some awkward phrasing, such as "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body."

Now, let me assess the coherence:

Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected.

Issues I notice regarding coherence:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Will Bradley to a completely different narrative involving characters named Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston. This is a significant structural issue with no clear connection to Bradley.
2. [LOGIC] The second chapter begins with a scene of a graduation day but then shifts to a completely different narrative involving Sir Simon and a blood-stain. This appears to be an unrelated fragment.
3. [LOGIC] The text has a confusing transition from discussing Bradley's career to a narrative about a character named Stransom encountering someone in London. This section appears to be a different story altogether.
4. [LOGIC] The text has another confusing transition from the Stransom narrative back to discussing Bradley's legacy and impact.
5. [STRUCTURE] The second chapter begins with a scene of a graduation day but then jumps to a completely different narrative about a character named Sir Simon and a blood-stain, which seems unrelated to the main subject.
6. [LOGIC] The text has several disconnected fragments that appear to be from different stories. For example, the section about Sir Simon and the blood-stain appears to be a fragment from a different Gothic novel or story.

Based on my assessment:

For fluency:
- The text has several grammar and punctuation issues that affect readability
- There are some awkward phrasings and run-on sentences
- The text has inconsistent capitalization and missing articles
- However, the overall structure of sentences is generally clear and the text is mostly readable

For coherence:
- The text has significant structural issues with multiple disconnected narratives
- There are major logic issues with abrupt shifts between different stories
- The text appears to contain fragments from different stories that are not connected
- The transitions between different narrative sections are abrupt and confusing

Now I'll assign scores:

Fluency Score: 3/5 - The text is generally readable but has several grammar, punctuation, and phrasing issues that affect fluency.

Coherence Score: 2/5 - The text has significant coherence issues with multiple disconnected narratives and abrupt transitions between different stories.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

[STRUCTURE] The text contains multiple disconnected narratives that appear to be fragments from different stories. It abruptly shifts from discussing Will Bradley to a completely different narrative involving Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston, then to a scene about Sir Simon and a blood-stain, with no clear connections between these elements.

[LOGIC] The text has confusing transitions between different narrative sections. For example, it shifts from discussing Bradley's career to a narrative about Stransom encountering someone in London, then back to discussing Bradley's legacy, with no clear logical connections between these sections.

[LOGIC] The second chapter begins with a scene of a graduation day but then jumps to a completely different narrative about Sir Simon and a blood-stain, which seems unrelated to the main subject of Will Bradley.

[GRAMMAR] There are several missing articles and possessive forms, such as "Will Bradley, His Chap Book" which should be "Will Bradley's Chap Book."

[GRAMMAR] The text has inconsistent capitalization of the first word in sentences after line breaks. For example, "But still there is something to talk about..." should not have "But" capitalized if it's the continuation of a sentence.

[SYNTAX] There are run-on sentences that affect readability, such as "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."

[GRAMMAR] The text has missing commas that would help with readability, such as in "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too."

[GRAMMAR] The phrase "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work" has a missing comma after "Press."

[LEXICON] The word "Nineties" is not capitalized, which is inconsistent with the capitalization of other decades like "’85" in the second chapter.

[GRAMMAR] The text has awkward phrasing in places, such as "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body."
