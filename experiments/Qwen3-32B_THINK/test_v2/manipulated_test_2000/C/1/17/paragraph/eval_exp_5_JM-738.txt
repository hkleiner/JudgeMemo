Let me analyze the given text for fluency and coherence:

First, I'll read through the text carefully to understand its content and structure:

The text appears to be an academic analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "Edwin Drood." It begins with an introduction discussing Dickens's writing style in his later works, particularly focusing on construction and plot development. The text then shifts to a chapter called "THE STORY," which provides a detailed character summary and plot overview of "Edwin Drood."

Now, I'll evaluate the text for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency Analysis:**

Fluency relates to the overall clarity and readability of the text, including sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

Issues I notice:
- Some sentences are quite long and complex, making them difficult to follow at times.
- The text uses many archaic or formal expressions that may be less familiar to modern readers.
- There are some instances of inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Mr. Bud" vs. "Mr. drood").
- The text has some awkward phrasings and word choices.
- There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and quotation marks.
- The text has some confusing sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the flow.

**Coherence Analysis:**

Coherence relates to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected, including logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, clarity of transitions, and consistency of ideas.

Issues I notice:
- The text jumps between different topics and perspectives at times.
- There are some abrupt shifts in focus and subject matter.
- Some concepts are introduced without proper context or explanation.
- The text sometimes refers to things that have not been previously explained.
- The flow between paragraphs is sometimes disjointed.
- There are some unclear connections between ideas.

Now, I'll identify specific issues with tags:

**Fluency Issues:**

- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow (e.g., "But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'").
- [LEXICON] The text uses many archaic or formal expressions that may be less familiar to modern readers (e.g., "Youth will be served;” no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”").
- [GRAMMAR] There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and quotation marks (e.g., "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.").
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward constructions that make them difficult to follow (e.g., "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling.").
- [LEXICON] There are some confusing word choices or phrases (e.g., "the tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap").

**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics and perspectives at times without clear transitions (e.g., from discussing Dickens's writing style to suddenly describing a scene with Stransom and Creston).
- [STRUCTURE] There are some abrupt shifts in focus and subject matter (e.g., from discussing Dickens's writing techniques to suddenly providing a character summary of "Edwin Drood").
- [LOGIC] Some concepts are introduced without proper context or explanation (e.g., the character Stransom appears suddenly without introduction).
- [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is sometimes disjointed (e.g., from discussing Dickens's theories to suddenly providing a detailed character summary).
- [LOGIC] There are some unclear connections between ideas (e.g., the connection between the shop-front scene and the analysis of Dickens's writing style is not clear).

Overall assessment:

The text is academic in nature and provides detailed analysis of Dickens's work, but it suffers from some readability issues due to complex sentence structures, archaic language, and occasional awkward phrasing. The organization and flow of ideas could be improved with better transitions and more consistent structure.

For fluency, I would rate it around a 3 or 4 out of 5 - it's generally readable but has some issues that make it less smooth and accessible.

For coherence, I would rate it around a 3 or 4 out of 5 - the text covers a lot of ground but sometimes jumps between ideas without clear connections, making it somewhat disjointed in places.

Let me refine my scores based on a more careful reading and specific examples:

**Fluency:**
- The text has many long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow.
- There are several archaic or obscure expressions that may confuse modern readers.
- Some sentences have awkward or confusing word choices.
- The punctuation is sometimes inconsistent or incorrect.
- The text has some confusing sentence structures.

**Coherence:**
- The text jumps between different topics and perspectives without clear transitions.
- There are abrupt shifts in focus and subject matter.
- Some concepts are introduced without proper context or explanation.
- The flow between paragraphs is sometimes disjointed.
- There are unclear connections between ideas.

Based on these observations, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

**Fluency Issues:**

- [SYNTAX] The sentence "But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'" is overly complex and difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] The phrase "Youth will be served;” no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”" contains archaic or obscure expressions that may be less familiar to modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] The use of quotation marks and italics is inconsistent and sometimes confusing.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." has an awkward construction.
- [LEXICON] The phrase "the tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap" is confusing in its metaphorical meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The text jumps from discussing Dickens's writing style to suddenly describing a scene with Stransom and Creston without clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The shift from discussing Dickens's theories to providing a detailed character summary of "Edwin Drood" is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The character Stransom appears suddenly without introduction or context.
- [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is sometimes disjointed, particularly when moving from one topic to another.
- [LOGIC] The connection between the shop-front scene and the analysis of Dickens's writing style is unclear.
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Lord Canterville and the ghost appears completely out of place in the text and seems unrelated to the rest of the analysis.

**Final Assessment:**

The text is clearly an academic analysis of Dickens's work, but it suffers from several readability issues due to complex sentence structures, archaic language, and occasional awkward phrasing. The organization and flow of ideas could be improved with better transitions and more consistent structure. While the content is informative, the presentation is sometimes confusing and difficult to follow.
