Alright, I need to evaluate the quality of this story, focusing on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand its content and structure.

First, fluency refers to the clarity, readability, and smoothness of the text. I'll check for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected, including logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, transitions, and consistency.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues. There are some grammatical errors, like missing articles or incorrect verb forms. For example, "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent..." seems to lack a subject after the comma. Also, the sentence structure is often complex and run-on, which affects readability. 

In terms of coherence, the text jumps between ideas without clear transitions. The author mentions the Garden of Eden in America, provides some geographical details, and then discusses the presence of rattlesnakes, which feels disconnected. There's also a lack of clear organization; the paragraphs don't follow a logical sequence. The text starts with the author's discovery, then shifts to biblical references, geographical descriptions, and then to the presence of snakes, which seems abrupt.

I should also note any redundant phrases or unclear references. The author uses phrases like "our garden" repeatedly without clear antecedents. There's also some vague or ambiguous phrasing, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'..." which is unclear in its meaning.

Overall, the text has some interesting ideas but is hindered by poor structure and language issues. The fluency is low due to grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures. The coherence is also low because the ideas are not well-organized and transitions are weak.

**FLUENCY ISSUES:**  
[GRAMMAR] Missing articles and incorrect verb forms (e.g., "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent..." lacks a subject after the comma).  
[SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and fragmented phrases (e.g., "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it").  
[LEXICON] Redundancy and awkward phrasing (e.g., "our garden is again right" and "our garden is still in the right place" repeat ideas without clarity).  
[CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "our garden" is used repeatedly without clear antecedents).  

**COHERENCE ISSUES:**  
[LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims and abrupt shifts in focus (e.g., transitioning from biblical geography to rattlesnakes in "rattlesnake hills" without explanation).  
[STRUCTURE] Poor paragraph organization; ideas jump between historical speculation, geographical descriptions, and anecdotal details (e.g., the discussion of "La Crosse" interrupts the flow of the Eden argument).  
[TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitions between sections (e.g., the text shifts from "the finger of time" to "the discovery resulted from my familiarity with the Bible" without logical connection).  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**
