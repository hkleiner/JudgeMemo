Let me carefully evaluate the provided story text for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll read through the text and identify specific issues that affect these dimensions.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text, such as missing articles ("In America, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference") and missing commas.
2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, making them difficult to follow. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors."
3. [LEXICON] Some word choices are unclear or imprecise, such as "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye."
4. [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or ambiguous, such as "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Will Bradley's impact on American design to detailed accounts of his childhood and early career without much context.
2. [LOGIC] Some logical connections between ideas are weak or missing. For example, the transition from discussing Bradley's retirement to his impact on younger designers is abrupt.
3. [TRANSITION] There are many abrupt shifts in perspective and tense throughout the text. The narrative sometimes shifts from third-person to second-person without explanation.
4. [ORGANIZATION] The text lacks a clear organizational structure. While it does follow a chronological order to some extent, the flow is often disrupted by tangents and detailed descriptions that don't clearly contribute to the overall narrative.

Now, let me evaluate the specific issues in more detail and rate the text on both fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Rating:**
The text has significant fluency issues that affect readability. The grammar is often incorrect, the sentence structure is frequently awkward, and there are many instances of unclear or imprecise word choices. These issues make the text difficult to read and understand at times. I would rate this at a 2 on the 1-5 scale.

**Coherence Rating:**
The text has major coherence problems. The narrative jumps around without clear transitions, and the logical connections between ideas are often weak or missing. The text lacks a clear organizational structure, and the flow is frequently disrupted by tangents and disjointed descriptions. I would rate this at a 2 on the 1-5 scale.

Let me now identify the specific issues in the text with more detailed examples.

1. [GRAMMAR] "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." (Missing articles and unclear phrasing)
2. [SYNTAX] "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors." (Awkward sentence construction)
3. [LEXICON] "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." (Unclear word choice and redundancy)
4. [CLARITY] "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." (Ambiguous phrasing)
5. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from discussing Bradley's impact on American design to detailed accounts of his childhood and early career without clear transitions.
6. [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Bradley's retirement to his impact on younger designers is abrupt and lacks logical connection.
7. [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts from third-person to second-person without explanation, such as "You are six years old; next month you will be seven."
8. [ORGANIZATION] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, with many tangents and disjointed descriptions that don't clearly contribute to the overall narrative.

Based on this analysis, I believe my initial ratings of 2 for both fluency and coherence are appropriate.

Wait, let me do one more review to make sure I'm not missing anything. The text is quite long and detailed, and I want to be thorough in my evaluation.

The text is a biography of Will Bradley, an American typographer and designer. It attempts to tell his life story in a narrative form, but the narrative is often disjointed and lacks clear transitions. The text is filled with detailed descriptions of Bradley's early life, his career, and his impact on American design, but these descriptions often don't connect well with each other.

The text also has a strange narrative structure, with the author sometimes addressing the reader directly in second-person while other times maintaining a third-person perspective. This shift in perspective is often abrupt and confusing.

The text also contains many historical details and references to other artists and designers, but these references are often presented without sufficient context or explanation.

Given these issues, I maintain my initial ratings of 2 for both fluency and coherence.

Let me now finalize my evaluation with specific examples of the issues I've identified.

1. [GRAMMAR] "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." (Missing articles and unclear phrasing)
2. [SYNTAX] "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors." (Awkward sentence construction)
3. [LEXICON] "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." (Unclear word choice and redundancy)
4. [CLARITY] "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." (Ambiguous phrasing)
5. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from discussing Bradley's impact on American design to detailed accounts of his childhood and early career without clear transitions.
6. [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Bradley's retirement to his impact on younger designers is abrupt and lacks logical connection.
7. [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts from third-person to second-person without explanation, such as "You are six years old; next month you will be seven."
8. [ORGANIZATION] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, with many tangents and disjointed descriptions that don't clearly contribute to the overall narrative.

Based on this detailed analysis, I will provide my final ratings.

Actually, let me review one more time to see if I'm missing any other significant issues. The text has many detailed descriptions of Bradley's life and career, but these descriptions often lack context and are presented in a disjointed manner. The text also has many historical references that are not well explained or contextualized.

I believe my initial ratings of 2 for both fluency and coherence are still appropriate. The text is difficult to read and understand due to its poor grammar, awkward sentence structure, and unclear word choices. It is also difficult to follow due to its disjointed structure and weak logical connections between ideas.

Let me now finalize my evaluation and provide the specific issues I've identified.
