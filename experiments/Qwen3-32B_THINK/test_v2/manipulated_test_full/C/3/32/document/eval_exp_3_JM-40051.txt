Alright, I'm going to evaluate the quality of this story based on fluency and coherence. Let me first carefully read through the text to understand what it's about and identify any issues.

This text appears to be a historical or religious account of a supposed discovery of the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River region of the United States. The author claims to have found a location that matches the biblical description of the Garden of Eden, with specific geographical features like rivers, hills, and valleys that align with the biblical narrative.

Now I'll evaluate the text on two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

**Fluency** refers to how smooth, clear, and readable the text is. I'll look at:
- Sentence structure and grammar
- Punctuation
- Word choice and redundancy
- Overall readability

**Coherence** refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. I'll look at:
- Logical flow between sentences and paragraphs
- Clarity of transitions
- Consistency of ideas
- Avoidance of abrupt shifts or unresolved references

Let me go through the text and identify specific issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "have a reasonable thing of it" - This is grammatically incorrect. It should be something like "have a reasonable idea of it" or "have a reasonable understanding of it."

2. [GRAMMAR] "in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" - This is a clear grammatical error. It should probably be "in the 'INDEPENDENT' chapter" or something similar.

3. [GRAMMAR] "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them" - This is a run-on sentence with poor punctuation.

4. [GRAMMAR] "no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent" - The placement of "nor" and the overall structure is awkward.

5. [GRAMMAR] "the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time" - This sentence structure is awkward and could be clearer.

6. [GRAMMAR] "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it" - This is a run-on sentence with poor punctuation.

7. [GRAMMAR] "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" - This is a run-on sentence with poor punctuation.

8. [GRAMMAR] "and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion" - This is a run-on sentence.

9. "This is the garden of a thing" - "a thing" is a placeholder and doesn't make sense in this context.

10. "Of course I had never given it thought" - This is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

11. "nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or might be its proper dimentions" - "dimentions" is a misspelling of "dimensions."

13. "I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my friends" - This is a run-on sentence with poor punctuation.

15. "Since I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while some have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being not only possible, but highly probable" - This is a long, complex sentence that could be broken up for better readability.

16. "Where would a scientest place the first pair" - "scientest" is a misspelling of "scientist."
