Alright, I'll evaluate the story for fluency and coherence as requested. This is a long and detailed text about Will Bradley's life and career as a designer and printer. Let me carefully read through it to identify issues.

For fluency, I'll look for:
- Sentence construction problems
- Grammar and punctuation issues
- Word choice and redundancy
- Awkward phrasing or unclear expressions

For coherence, I'll look for:
- Logical flow between sentences and paragraphs
- Clarity of transitions
- Organizational structure
- Consistency of ideas

Let me go through the text systematically.

First, I notice the text has many [stuff] placeholders that appear to be missing words or locations. These are clearly problematic for both fluency and coherence. The story is about a real person (Will Bradley, a historical figure in typography), but these placeholders make it difficult to understand the narrative.

Let me identify specific issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [GRAMMAR] Repeated use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" without context makes the text confusing. These placeholders suggest missing words that should be specific locations, titles, or names.
2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are very long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example: "Across the stuff, the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams: Morris failing to revive medievalism but startling his world with a revival of fine craftsmanship; Beardsley, the Yellow Book and their avant garde galaxy startling their world in quite a different way; Toulouse-Lautrec spreading modern art in the kiosks of the thing when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, the stuff; barriers being demolished everywhere."
3. [LEXICON] Some word choices are unclear or confusing. For example, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye."
4. [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have grammatical issues. For example: "There were derivative traces in a thing early work--and whose hasn’t?"
5. [CLARITY] The text often jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions.
6. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward structure. For example: "In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference."

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into chapters, but the flow between chapters is often abrupt. The narrative jumps between different periods of Bradley's life without clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces concepts without sufficient explanation. For example, the significance of certain design choices in typography is mentioned but not fully explained.
3. [TRANSITION] There are weak transitions between paragraphs and chapters. The text often moves from one topic to another without clear connections.
4. [LOGIC] The narrative is occasionally confusing, particularly when it references historical events or design movements without proper context.
5. [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes repeats information or goes off on tangents without returning to the main narrative.

Specific examples of issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "There were derivative traces in a thing early work--and whose hasn’t?" This sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing. It should likely be "There were derivative traces in his early work--and whose hasn't?" but even then, it's awkwardly phrased.

2. [SYNTAX] "In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference." The phrase "In the stuff" is unclear and disrupts the flow of the sentence.

3. [LEXICON] "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free," - The adjective "bold and free" is vague and doesn't clearly convey what makes the typography significant.

4. [STRUCTURE] The text moves from discussing Bradley's early life in Ishpeming to his career in Chicago to his retirement without clear transitions between these major life phases.

5. [LOGIC] The text mentions "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams" but doesn't clearly explain what this means or how it relates to Bradley's work.

6. [TRANSITION] The text often jumps from one topic to another without clear connections. For example, it moves from discussing Bradley's early career to his retirement without explaining the progression.

7. [CLARITY] The frequent use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" makes it difficult to understand the narrative. These placeholders suggest missing words that should be specific locations, titles, or names.

8. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward structure. For example: "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors."

9. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces concepts without sufficient explanation. For example, it mentions "the Kelmscott Press" without explaining its significance or how it relates to Bradley's work.

10. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into chapters, but the flow between chapters is often abrupt. The narrative jumps between different periods of Bradley's life without clear transitions.

Overall assessment:

The story has a rich content about Will Bradley's life and career, but the frequent use of [stuff] placeholders and the overall structure make it difficult to follow. The text has many long, complex sentences that disrupt the flow. The transitions between paragraphs and chapters are often weak, and the narrative jumps between different time periods without clear connections. The text also has grammatical issues and unclear word choices that affect readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2 (The text has significant issues with logical flow, weak transitions, and organizational structure. The narrative jumps between different time periods and concepts without clear connections, and the frequent use of [stuff] placeholders makes it difficult to follow.)
FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (The text has numerous grammatical issues, awkward sentence structures, and unclear word choices. The frequent use of [stuff] placeholders and long, complex sentences disrupts the flow and readability.)

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Specific Issues:**  

**Coherence Issues:**  
[STRUCTURE] The narrative frequently jumps between time periods and locations without clear transitions (e.g., from Ishpeming to Chicago to Springfield) or contextual explanations.  
[LOGIC] Key concepts (e.g., "the Kelmscott Press," "Colonial typography") are mentioned without sufficient explanation, leaving readers to infer their significance.  
[TRANSITION] Paragraphs and chapters often shift abruptly, with no connecting phrases to guide the reader (e.g., moving from Bradley’s childhood to his career in Chicago without bridging context).  
[STRUCTURE] Repetition of events and ideas occurs across chapters (e.g., descriptions of his early career and design philosophies are repeated without clear progression).  

**Fluency Issues:**  
[GRAMMAR] Sentences often contain grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect punctuation (e.g., “There were derivative traces in a thing early work--and whose hasn’t?”).  
[SYNTAX] Overly long and complex sentences disrupt readability (e.g., multi-clause sentences with unclear subject-verb agreement).  
[LEXICON] Redundant or vague phrasing (e.g., “bold and free” to describe typography) and awkward expressions (e.g., “the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams”) hinder clarity.  
[CLARITY] Frequent use of “the stuff” and “a stuff” as placeholders for missing words creates confusion and breaks immersion in the narrative.  

**Overall:** The text’s structure and frequent gaps in specificity (via placeholders) severely impact both coherence and fluency, making the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow.
