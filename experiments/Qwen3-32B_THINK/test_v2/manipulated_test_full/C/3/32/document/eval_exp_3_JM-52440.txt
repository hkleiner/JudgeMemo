Let me carefully assess the given text for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll understand the content - it appears to be a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's a long, formal, and complex text that discusses various theological positions, referencing articles of faith, liturgical texts, and historical context.

Now I'll evaluate for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
This refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, including sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text reads smoothly from start to finish, without awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing structures.

Issues I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors and awkward constructions. For example, "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine."
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question. My present concern is with the fact that, however we explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life: ‘Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.’"
- [LEXICON] There are some word choice issues, such as "the thing" which appears frequently in the text, likely as a placeholder for "the Church of England" or "the Church."
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or ambiguous, like "the stuff" which appears throughout the text, likely referring to the Church of England but making the text confusing for readers.

**Coherence:**
This refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. It evaluates the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, the clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other in a consistent and understandable way.

Issues I notice:
- [STRUCTURE] The text follows a logical structure in that it addresses the subject in chapters, but the frequent use of "the thing" and "the stuff" makes it hard to follow the argument.
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally logical and well-structured, with clear points being made and supported.
- [TRANSITION] There are some weak transitions between paragraphs, especially when moving from one point to another without clear connectors.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is good - the text has an introduction, and then chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. But the frequent use of "the thing" and "the stuff" as placeholders makes it harder to follow the argument.

Let me now give final scores:

**Fluency Score (1-5):** I would give this text a 2 out of 5. The text has significant issues with grammar, syntax, and clarity that make it difficult to read. The frequent use of placeholder phrases like "the thing" and "the stuff" greatly reduces readability. The sentence structures are often complex and confusing.

**Coherence Score (1-5):** I would give this text a 3 out of 5. The argument is generally logical and well-structured, with clear points being made and supported. However, the use of placeholder phrases and some weak transitions between paragraphs make the text less coherent than it could be. The overall structure is good, but the execution has some issues that affect the flow of ideas.

Let me review my assessment to ensure it's accurate:

- The text has significant grammatical and syntactical issues that reduce fluency.
- The frequent use of placeholder phrases like "the thing" and "the stuff" makes the text harder to follow.
- The argument is generally logical, but the execution has some coherence issues.
- The structure is good but could be improved with better transitions.

My final assessment stands: Fluency 2/5, Coherence 3/5.

**Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] The text contains grammatical errors, such as "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." The phrase "a stuff" is clearly incorrect.
- [SYNTAX] The text has many complex, run-on sentences that make it difficult to follow, such as "The result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine."
- [LEXICON] There is frequent use of placeholder phrases like "the thing" and "the stuff" throughout the text, which makes the meaning unclear and reduces readability.
- [CLARITY] The text often uses archaic or overly formal language that is difficult to understand for modern readers, such as "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" and "IT" should be "It" for consistency with modern English capitalization rules.
- [GRAMMAR] There are instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, such as in the sentence "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching."

**Coherence Issues:**

- [STRUCTURE] The text has a logical structure with an introduction and chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. However, the frequent use of placeholder phrases like "the thing" and "the stuff" disrupts the flow.
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally logical, but the use of placeholder phrases and the overly formal language make it harder to follow the reasoning.
- [TRANSITION] There are some weak transitions between paragraphs and ideas, especially when moving from one point to another without clear connectors.
- [CLARITY] The text often discusses complex theological concepts without sufficient explanation, making it difficult for readers to fully understand the argument.
- [STRUCTURE] While the text is organized into chapters and sections, the frequent use of placeholder phrases and the complex language make it challenging to follow the overall argument.

**Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
