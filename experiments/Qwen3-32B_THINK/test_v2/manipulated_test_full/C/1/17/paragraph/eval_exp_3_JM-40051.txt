Alright, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The story is about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, particularly around the Mississippi River. The author makes various claims about the geographical and biblical evidence supporting this theory. 

First, I'll look at fluency. Fluency involves sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and readability. I'll check for awkward phrasing, redundancy, confusing structures, or anything that might make the text hard to follow.

I notice a lot of run-on sentences and some fragmented ones. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary, and the sentence is a bit awkward. There are also some missing commas and incorrect use of hyphens. For instance, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians" with a hyphen. 

Word choice and redundancy are also issues. Phrases like "very slow in making public the results of my discovery" could be more concise. There's also some awkward phrasing, such as "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT." The capitalization of "CHAPTER" seems out of place and confusing. 

Looking at coherence, which is about the logical flow and organization of ideas. The story jumps around a lot, discussing biblical references, geographical features, and even some unrelated anecdotes about tramps and a lawyer. The connections between paragraphs are sometimes weak, making it hard to follow the main argument. 

For example, after discussing the Garden of Eden's location, the text suddenly shifts to a description of a town with tramps and a cathedral, which seems unrelated. Similarly, there's a mention of George Stransom and his memories of the dead, which doesn't tie into the main topic. These abrupt shifts disrupt the flow and make the text incoherent.

There are also some logical gaps. The author makes claims without sufficient evidence, such as linking rattlesnakes to the presence of the Garden of Eden. The transitions between ideas are often missing or weak, making it hard to see how one point leads to the next. 

Additionally, the story includes some irrelevant details, like the lawyer's point about the devil, which doesn't contribute to the main argument. The structure is also problematic, with long paragraphs that cover multiple topics without clear organization. 

In terms of grammar and punctuation, there are several errors. For instance, "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" has a typo ("admirirg" should be "admir-ing" or "admirable"). There's also incorrect use of hyphens and commas, such as in "the antldiluvians" and "the “North West,” as the place." 

The word choice sometimes is redundant or awkward. Phrases like "very slow in making public the results of my discovery" could be more concise. The use of archaic or overly formal language, such as "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it," makes the text harder to read.

Overall, while the story has a clear central idea, the execution in terms of fluency and coherence is lacking. The numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and disorganized structure all contribute to a lower fluency score. The lack of logical flow and frequent shifts in topic also hurt the coherence score.

[GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors are present, such as "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admirable"), and missing commas in run-on sentences.  
[SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures, such as "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere," disrupt readability.  
[LEXICON] Redundant or unclear phrasing, e.g., "very slow in making public the results of my discovery," and archaic terms like "thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it," hinder clarity.  
[LOGIC] Gaps in reasoning, such as linking rattlesnakes to the Garden of Eden, lack supporting evidence.  
[STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between biblical claims, geographical descriptions, and unrelated anecdotes (e.g., tramps, a lawyer’s argument), creating disorganization.  
[CLARITY] Vague assertions like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the ‘North West’" lack specificity.  
[TRANSITION] Weak or missing transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., shifting from Eden to a cathedral and tramps without connection).
