Let me carefully read and analyze this story to evaluate its fluency and coherence.

First, I'll read through the entire text to get a sense of the overall quality.

The story is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. It's a well-known story about an American family who move into a haunted English house and encounter a ghost.

Now let me evaluate fluency first:

FLUENCY:
1. I notice some grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "coulded was seen" instead of "could be seen", "have am quite unknown" instead of "have been quite unknown".
2. There are a few punctuation issues, particularly with missing or incorrect commas in complex sentences.
3. The vocabulary is appropriate for the story, though there are some archaic or unusual word choices that are likely intentional (as the story has a period setting).
4. The sentence structure is generally clear, though some sentences are quite long and complex.
5. There are a few awkward phrasings that disrupt the smooth reading flow.

COHERENCE:
1. The story has a clear narrative structure with a beginning, middle, and end.
2. The plot is logically developed with cause-and-effect relationships that make sense.
3. The characters are consistent in their behavior and motivations.
4. The transitions between paragraphs and scenes are generally smooth, though there are a few places where the flow could be improved.
5. The story maintains a consistent tone and style throughout.
6. The themes (haunting, American vs British cultural differences, redemption) are consistent and well-developed.

Let me now go through the text in more detail to identify specific issues:
