Alright, let's start by reading through the provided story carefully. The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's structured into chapters, with detailed arguments referencing church documents like the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies.

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency involves sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which might be expected in a theological treatise. However, I notice some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing. For example, in the line "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift," "connexion" is an older spelling of "connection," which is acceptable in historical texts but might be considered non-standard. There are also instances where sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." This sentence is clear, but the surrounding paragraphs have several run-on sentences that could be split for better readability. Additionally, there are some punctuation issues, such as missing commas in complex sentences, which can affect clarity.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and organization of ideas. The text is structured into chapters, each addressing different aspects of the doctrine. However, the transition between some sections is abrupt. For instance, the shift from discussing the Articles to the Catechism could be smoother. The author often introduces a point and then delves into detailed arguments without clear signposts, which can make it hard to follow the main argument. For example, in the section on the Catechism, the author suddenly shifts to discussing the word "Sacrament" and its various usages without clearly linking it to the previous discussion. Additionally, there are some instances where the author makes assertions without providing sufficient context or explanation, which can confuse the reader. For example, when discussing the Homilies, the author references specific passages without clearly explaining how they support the argument, requiring the reader to infer the connection.

Now, looking for specific issues. There are a few instances of [GRAMMAR] errors, such as the use of "connexion" instead of "connection" and missing commas in complex sentences. [SYNTAX] issues include overly long sentences that could be broken down for clarity. [LEXICON] problems involve the use of archaic terms that might be confusing to modern readers. [LOGIC] gaps occur when arguments are made without sufficient explanation, and [STRUCTURE] issues arise from abrupt transitions between sections. [CLARITY] is affected by the dense, formal language and the lack of clear signposts in the argumentation. [TRANSITION] issues are present where the flow between ideas is not smooth, making the text harder to follow.

Considering these points, the fluency score would be around 3 because while the text is generally readable, the archaic language, complex sentences, and some grammatical issues hinder smooth reading. The coherence score would also be around 3 due to the logical structure but with some abrupt transitions and unclear connections between ideas.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Identified:**  

[GRAMMAR] Non-standard spelling (e.g., "connexion" instead of "connection") and missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching").  

[SYNTAX] Overly long and convoluted sentences (e.g., "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching...").  

[LEXICON] Archaic or obscure vocabulary (e.g., "connexion," "consecration," "transubstantiation") may confuse modern readers without context.  

[LOGIC] Gaps in reasoning (e.g., abrupt shifts from discussing theological documents to critiquing specific practices like adoration without clear linkage).  

[STRUCTURE] Poor transitions between sections (e.g., moving abruptly from the Articles to the Catechism without bridging ideas).  

[CLARITY] Dense, formal language and lack of signposts make the argument hard to follow (e.g., "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating...").  

[TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from doctrinal analysis to critiques of Ritualists) without smooth connections.
