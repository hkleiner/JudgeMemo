Okay, I need to evaluate the quality of this story based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, fluency. This refers to clarity, grammar, sentence structure, etc. I'll look for awkward phrasing, grammar issues, punctuation problems, or word choice that makes the text hard to read.

I notice some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that goes on for several lines without a period. That's a bit confusing. Also, there are some parts where the sentence structure is unclear. For instance, the line "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This seems like a run-on sentence with missing words and unclear meaning. There are also instances where the word order doesn't make sense, like in the line "He is the kind you place on a table and slap with the palm of your hand." The word "kind" seems misplaced here. 

There are some punctuation issues too. For example, "He is the kind you place on a table and slap with the palm of your hand." The comma placement and sentence structure are off. Also, there are some missing commas and periods in the text that make it hard to follow. 

In terms of word choice, some phrases are redundant or awkward. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." The adjectives here are a bit excessive and could be simplified. Also, there are some instances where the same word is used multiple times in a short span, like "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." The repetition of "he" and "it" might be a bit jarring.

Now, coherence. This is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. I need to check if the flow between sentences and paragraphs is logical. 

The story jumps between different time periods and topics, which might disrupt the flow. For example, the introduction starts with the author's introduction to Will Bradley's work, then shifts to discussing his impact on American graphic arts, and then to his early life. The transition between these sections isn't very smooth. There are also some abrupt shifts in the narrative, like from discussing the Nineteenth Century to Bradley's work in the Nineties. 

Some paragraphs don't clearly connect to the next. For example, after discussing the impact of Bradley's work, the text suddenly moves to a paragraph that seems to be a jumble of words and phrases without a clear connection. This is the line: "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This doesn't make sense and breaks the flow. 

There are also some unclear references. For example, in the line "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing." The pronouns and structure here are confusing. It's unclear who "they" refers to, and the sentence structure is all over the place. 

The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt. For example, the chapter "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" starts with a scene in a schoolhouse, then moves to the boy's early life and work. The transition from the introduction to this chapter is a bit jarring because it's a sudden shift in time and setting. 

There are also some unresolved references or missing information. For example, in the line "He brings you a box of pi. When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font you file them to fit the type slot in the press." The term "pi" here is unclear. It might be a typo for "type" or "type metal," but without context, it's confusing. 

Additionally, some parts of the text seem to be missing words or have typos. For example, "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that." This sentence is incoherent and lacks proper structure, making it hard to understand the intended meaning. 

Overall, while the story contains detailed information about Will Bradley's life and career, the fluency and coherence are affected by several issues. The text has grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, unclear transitions, and some incoherent passages. These issues make the reading experience challenging and disrupt the flow of the narrative.

**[GRAMMAR]** The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as run-on sentences and incorrect word order. For example, the line "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." is a grammatically incoherent sentence fragment.  

**[SYNTAX]** Sentence structure is often awkward or overly complex. For instance, "He is the kind you place on a table and slap with the palm of your hand." The placement of "kind" is incorrect, confusing the intended meaning.  

**[LEXICON]** Redundant or excessive adjectives are used, such as "non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design," which could be simplified for clarity.  

**[LOGIC]** There are abrupt shifts in narrative, such as the sudden transition from discussing the Nineteenth Century to Bradley’s work in the Nineties without clear transitions.  

**[STRUCTURE]** Paragraphs often lack logical flow. The chapter "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" shifts abruptly from a schoolhouse scene to the protagonist’s early life, disrupting coherence.  

**[CLARITY]** Unresolved references and missing context confuse the reader. For example, "He brings you a box of pi" uses "pi" ambiguously, likely a typo for "type" or "type metal."  

**[TRANSITION]** Weak transitions between ideas and paragraphs are evident. The line "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing" is incoherent and lacks logical connection to surrounding text.  

**[STRUCTURE]** The text includes disjointed sections, such as the nonsensical passage: "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that."

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
The text suffers from abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and unresolved references, significantly disrupting the logical flow and organization of ideas.  

**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  
Fluency is hindered by grammatical errors, awkward syntax, redundant phrasing, and incoherent sentences that make the text difficult to read and understand.
