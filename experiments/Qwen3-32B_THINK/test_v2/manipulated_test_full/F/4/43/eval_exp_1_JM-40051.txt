I need to evaluate the quality of this story on two dimensions: fluency and coherence. I'll go through the text carefully, noting specific issues as I go, and then provide my final scores.

### Reading the Story

This story is a long, detailed account of a claim that the Garden of Eden was located in a specific region in the United States, specifically along the Mississippi River between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The author presents a mix of religious references, geographical descriptions, and historical claims to support this assertion.

### Fluency Issues

I notice numerous issues with fluency in the text:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** There are frequent grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and run-on sentences.
2. **[SYNTAX]** The sentence structures are often awkward and confusing, with misplaced modifiers and unclear subject-verb relationships.
3. **[LEXICON]** There are instances of word choice that don't make sense in context, as well as apparent misspellings.
4. **[CLARITY]** The text often uses unclear or ambiguous phrasing that makes it difficult to understand the intended meaning.

Let me provide specific examples of these issues:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** "In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he, man family the the new one, to nor thus consequently in out or—and and been how Noah the the, of a principal facts that one and not—giving stated destroyed a him the on and to, to of how a his, since the country, admitted mankind and present location creation; it of the point find being, then them, a somewhere description not be gave; could, has first, and themselves simply knew where was kept, it was able them of with he antldiluvians cause location, and all earth corrupted though then profound speculation on." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a jumble of words without proper grammatical structure.

2. **[SYNTAX]** "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." - This sentence has a very awkward structure with multiple clauses that make it difficult to follow.

3. **[LEXICON]** "admirirg" - This is clearly a misspelling of "admiring."

4. **[CLARITY]** "Since of commenced idea not have my, but with reality possible, while are claiming mocked, publish becoming the to possible only others a being views impressed some its, highly I probable." - This sentence is completely incoherent and lacks clarity.

5. **[GRAMMAR]** "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream." - This sentence has grammatical issues with the use of "should be" and the placement of clauses.

6. **[SYNTAX]** "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark,—densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes the islands and “river bottoms”—cut up by water courses and sloughs." - This sentence has an awkward structure and the word "consitutes" appears to be a misspelling of "constitutes."

7. **[LEXICON]** "consitutes" - This is a misspelling of "constitutes."

8. **[CLARITY]** "Now, please, place yourself with me on the “Central Outer Dome” “Heald’s quarry,” facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below, and around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and importance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world." - The sentence structure is confusing and the phrase "veritable Garden of Eden" is ambiguous.

9. **[GRAMMAR]** "Not like the Yosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a garden, but the very beau ideal of a garden." - This sentence has grammatical issues with the placement of adjectives and the use of "but."

10. **[SYNTAX]** "But as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing." - This sentence has a simple structure but is out of place after the previous description of rattlesnakes.

### Coherence Issues

The text also has several issues with coherence:

1. **[LOGIC]** The argument presented is often illogical or lacks supporting evidence for its claims.
2. **[STRUCTURE]** The organization of the text is confusing, with abrupt shifts in topic and no clear progression of ideas.
3. **[TRANSITION]** There are frequent transitions between ideas without clear connections or explanations.

Let me provide specific examples of these issues:

1. **[LOGIC]** The author makes numerous claims about the Garden of Eden being located in the described region without providing sufficient evidence or logical connections to support these claims.

2. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps from one geographical feature to another without a clear organizational pattern or progression.

3. **[TRANSITION]** "But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for themselves." - This sentence transitions abruptly from a discussion of previous theories to the author's claim without clear connection.

4. **[LOGIC]** The author makes claims about the region's suitability for the Garden of Eden based on its physical features and climate, but these claims are not logically connected to the biblical description of Eden.

5. **[STRUCTURE]** The text frequently goes back and forth between describing the geography of the region and making assertions about its being the Garden of Eden without a clear structure or organization.

6. **[TRANSITION]** "Now, will any one believe us? “Come and see!” Dr. Warner and all." - This transition from the author's claims to a challenge to readers is abrupt and lacks context.

7. **[LOGIC]** The author references various individuals and their theories about the location of Eden, but these references are not logically connected to the main argument.

8. **[STRUCTURE]** The text contains many subtopics (e.g., the author's personal history, geological references, etc.) that are not clearly organized or connected to the main thesis.

9. **[TRANSITION]** "Of the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting." - This sentence transitions abruptly from a discussion of the region's history to a comment on the scenery without clear connection.

10. **[LOGIC]** The author makes claims about the region's suitability for human settlement and agricultural production without logically connecting these claims to the biblical description of Eden.

### Final Assessment

After reviewing the text and identifying these issues, I'll now provide my final scores:

**Fluency Score:** 1 (worst)
- The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, misspellings, and unclear phrasing throughout.
- Many sentences are completely incoherent or difficult to understand.
- The text appears to have been poorly edited or proofread, with many obvious errors.

**Coherence Score:** 1 (worst)
- The text lacks logical organization and clear connections between ideas.
- The argument presented is often illogical or lacks supporting evidence.
- There are frequent abrupt shifts in topic and no clear progression of ideas.
- The transitions between ideas are often weak or missing.
- The author's claims are not logically connected to the evidence presented.

The text appears to be an incoherent and poorly written attempt to present a theory about the location of the Garden of Eden, with numerous errors that severely impact both its fluency and coherence.
