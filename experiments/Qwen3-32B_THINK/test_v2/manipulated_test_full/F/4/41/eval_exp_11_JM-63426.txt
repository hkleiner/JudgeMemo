I'll carefully evaluate the given story for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll read through the text to understand the overall content and structure. This appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American graphic designer and printer. The text is divided into chapters that chronologically follow his life and career.

Now, I'll assess fluency, which relates to the clarity and readability of the text. I'll look for:
- Sentence construction issues
- Grammar and punctuation problems
- Word choice and redundancy
- Awkward phrasing
- Confusing structures

For coherence, I'll evaluate:
- Logical flow between sentences and paragraphs
- Clarity of transitions
- Consistency in the organization of ideas
- Avoidance of abrupt shifts
- Resolution of references

Let me go through the text and identify specific issues:

Fluency Issues:
1. [GRAMMAR] The text has numerous missing or misplaced punctuation marks. For example, in the first chapter, "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to ghe sun and air." The word "ghe" appears to be a typo for "the."

2. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "dtartling" instead of "dartling," "ut" instead of "it," "tkme" instead of "time," and "generohs" instead of "generous."

3. [GRAMMAR] The text contains many run-on sentences with missing commas and periods. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a tkme when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors."

4. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward or confusing structures. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."

5. [LEXICON] There are instances of word choice that make the text less clear. For example, "He may have had some such idda in mind when he started the Wayside Press" where "idda" appears to be a typo for "idea."

Coherence Issues:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. For example, the first chapter introduces Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, then shifts to a detailed description of his childhood in Ishpeming without a clear transition.

2. [LOGIC] Some sections lack clear logical connections. For example, the section about the boy printer in Ishpeming seems to be a fictionalized account of Bradley's early life rather than a factual biography, which could confuse readers.

3. [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between topics without clear connecting phrases. For example, the text moves from discussing Bradley's childhood to his work in Chicago without explaining the connection.

4. [CLARITY] Some references are unclear or ambiguous. For example, in the section about the boy printer, it's unclear whether this is a direct account of Bradley's life or a fictionalized account.

5. [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex structure with multiple chapters that don't always follow a clear chronological or thematic order. This can make it difficult for readers to follow the narrative.

After evaluating these issues, I'll provide final scores for both fluency and coherence.

For fluency, I would rate this text as a 2 out of 5. The text has numerous grammar and spelling errors, awkward sentence structures, and unclear word choices that significantly impact readability.

For coherence, I would rate this text as a 2 out of 5. The text has significant issues with logical flow, transitions between ideas, and organization of content. The structure is confusing and the narrative is difficult to follow at times.

Let me review my assessment to make sure I'm being consistent and fair.

I believe these scores are appropriate given the significant issues with both fluency and coherence in the text.
