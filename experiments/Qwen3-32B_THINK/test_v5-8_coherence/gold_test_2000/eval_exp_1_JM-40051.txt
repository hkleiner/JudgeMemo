Alright, I need to evaluate the coherence of this text. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The text is about the author's claim that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific area in the United States, near the Mississippi River. The author describes their discovery and the features of this place, comparing it to biblical descriptions. 

First, I'll look for coherence issues. Coherence is about how well the sentences and ideas connect logically. The text is quite long, so I need to check for any abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps between different sections without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the discovery and initial reasoning, it suddenly shifts to a detailed description of the geographical features without a smooth transition. This can confuse the reader about the flow of ideas.

2. **[LOGIC]** Some arguments are based on weak logical connections. The author equates the Mississippi River with the Euphrates from the Bible without sufficient evidence, which might not hold up logically for all readers. This could lead to confusion about the validity of the comparisons.

3. **[CLARITY]** There are parts where the author's reasoning is unclear. For instance, the mention of "antldiluvians" is a typo for "antediluvians," but even with that correction, the explanation about the location being a mystery is a bit convoluted and hard to follow.

4. **[TRANSITION]** The text moves from one geographical detail to another without clear signposts. For example, after describing the hanging garden and its features, the author suddenly talks about the city of La Crosse and its significance, which feels disconnected from the previous paragraph.

5. **[REPETITION]** The author repeats certain phrases and ideas, such as the comparison between the Mississippi and the Euphrates, which can make the text feel redundant and less coherent. Repetition can dilute the main points and confuse the reader.

6. **[SPELLING]** There are some spelling errors like "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians") and "admirirg" (should be "admir[ing]"). While these are minor, they can distract the reader and affect the overall coherence by making the text seem less polished.

7. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them hard to parse. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth..." is a long, run-on sentence that could be broken down for better clarity and flow.

8. **[LEXICON]** The use of archaic or less common terms like "antldiluvians" and "Havilah" might be confusing to some readers. While these terms have specific meanings in the context of the Bible, their use without explanation can hinder coherence for those unfamiliar with them.

9. **[ORGANIZATION]** The overall structure of the text is somewhat disorganized. The author moves from the initial discovery, to geographical descriptions, to historical and religious comparisons, and then to current developments (like the city of La Crosse) without a clear progression. This can make it difficult to follow the main argument.

10. **[CONTRADICTION]** There are instances where the author's statements seem contradictory. For example, they mention that the garden is not too large, but then later describe it as a vast area. These contradictions can confuse the reader and reduce the coherence of the text.

Considering all these issues, the text has several problems with structure, logic, and clarity that affect its coherence. However, the author does maintain a central theme throughout, which is the claim that the Garden of Eden is in the specified location. The main ideas are connected, but the way they are presented is often disjointed or unclear. The score should reflect that the text is generally coherent but with noticeable issues that affect the flow and understanding.

Based on the evaluation criteria, a score of 3 is appropriate because the text has noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience. The author's arguments are not always logically connected, and the structure could be improved. However, the overall message is still somewhat understandable, so it doesn't fall into the lower scores (2 or 1). The issues are significant enough to warrant a score of 3 but not so severe that the text becomes incomprehensible.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between sections without clear transitions (e.g., moving from discovery to geographical details without logical flow).  
- [LOGIC] Weak logical connections in comparisons (e.g., equating the Mississippi River to the Euphrates without sufficient evidence).  
- [CLARITY] Convolution in explanations (e.g., "antediluvians" and biblical references lack clarity for general readers).  
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected paragraphs (e.g., sudden shift from "hanging garden" to La Crosse's significance).  
- [REPETITION] Redundant emphasis on the Mississippi-Euphrates comparison.  
- [SPELLING] Errors like "antldiluvians" and "admirirg" disrupt readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentences (e.g., run-on descriptions of the garden).  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic terms ("Havilah") without context.  
- [ORGANIZATION] Disjointed structure between discovery, geography, and historical claims.  
- [CONTRADICTION] Inconsistent descriptions (e.g., garden being "not too large" vs. "vast area").  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
