Alright, I need to evaluate the coherence of this long text about Will Bradley. Let me read through it and identify issues that might affect coherence.

First, I notice this is a biography of Will Bradley, written in a narrative style with many chapters. The text is quite lengthy and detailed, covering various periods of his life and career. 

I'll start by identifying coherence issues, which refer to how well the sentences and ideas connect to form a unified whole. The evaluation is on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being highly coherent.

1) **[STRUCTURE] The text is divided into many short chapters with inconsistent formatting.** The chapters vary in length and some have unusual formatting (like the chapter titles in all caps or the "A CHRONOLOGY" section at the end). This can make the reading experience disjointed.

2) **[LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different periods of Bradley's life with minimal transitions.** For example, the text moves from his childhood to his apprenticeship in Chicago to his later career without clear connections between these phases.

3) **[CLARITY] Some passages are overly detailed or tangential, making it difficult to follow the main narrative.** For instance, there are long descriptions of specific printing processes, historical context about other artists, and even some anachronistic elements (like references to modern technology in a historical narrative).

4) **[LOGIC] The text occasionally contradicts itself or presents information in a confusing order.** For example, it refers to "The 3D printer finished the replica" in a chapter about his early career in Chicago, which seems out of place and anachronistic.

5) **[STRUCTURE] The text includes a "Chronology" section at the end that repeats information already covered in the narrative, creating redundancy.** This could have been integrated more smoothly into the main text.

6) **[LOGIC] Some sentences or paragraphs appear to be inserted without clear relevance to the main narrative.** For example, the text mentions "The virtual pet blinked twice" in a chapter about his time in Chicago, which seems out of place and unrelated to the main content.

7) **[LOGIC] The text sometimes shifts between first-person and third-person narratives without clear indication.** This can be confusing, especially in the "Afterword" section where it's unclear who is speaking or writing.

8) **[CLARITY] The text contains some typographical errors or inconsistencies that affect readability.** For example, it refers to "the Inland Printer" without capitalizing the name consistently, and there are occasional punctuation issues.

9) **[LOGIC] The text includes anachronistic references that disrupt the historical narrative.** For example, mentions of GPS signals, holographic maps, and other modern technologies in a biography that should be set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

10) **[CLARITY] Some passages are written in a confusing or awkward style that makes the meaning unclear.** For instance, "The motion sensor caught a brief movement" in a chapter about his childhood appears out of context and disrupts the flow.

11) **[LOGIC] The text sometimes presents events in a non-chronological order without clear indication.** This can make it difficult to follow the timeline of Bradley's life and career.

12) **[CLARITY] The text includes some redundant or repetitive information that could have been condensed.** For example, the "Chronology" section at the end repeats many of the events already detailed in the main narrative.

13) **[LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new ideas or concepts without sufficient context or explanation.** For example, it refers to specific printing processes or historical events without providing enough background for a general reader to fully understand their significance.

14) **[CLARITY] The text occasionally uses overly complex sentence structures or jargon that may be difficult for a general audience to understand.** This can make the narrative less accessible to readers who are not familiar with the printing and design industry.

15) **[LOGIC] The text sometimes jumps between different aspects of Bradley's career without clear transitions.** For example, it moves from his work in Chicago to his later career in New York and then to his retirement without smoothly connecting these phases.

Based on these observations, I need to determine the coherence score. The text is quite detailed and well-researched, but the numerous structural issues, logical jumps, and anachronisms affect its overall coherence. While the narrative is generally chronological and covers Bradley's life in a reasonably logical order, the many disruptions and inconsistencies prevent it from being highly coherent.

I would rate this text as mostly coherent with some issues (score 3.5), as it tells a coherent story overall but has enough disruptions that affect the reading experience. However, considering the length and complexity of the text, and the fact that the narrative is generally chronological and covers Bradley's life in a reasonable order, I think a score of 4 might be more appropriate. The text is mostly coherent with only a few weak or disconnected parts, as described in the scale for a score of 4.

Let me reconsider and refine my evaluation. The text does tell a coherent story of Will Bradley's life and career, and it is generally well-structured in a chronological manner. However, the numerous structural issues, logical jumps, and anachronisms do affect its overall coherence. The text also has some redundancy and could benefit from clearer transitions between sections. Given these factors, I believe a score of 4 is appropriate.
