I need to evaluate the coherence of this long text about Will Bradley. Let me analyze the text carefully for coherence issues and determine a score.

First, I'll read through the text and identify any problems with its logical flow, structure, and overall coherence.

The text is a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. It has multiple chapters, including an introduction, chapters about his early life, career in Chicago, work in Springfield, and later career in the magazine world. There's also a chronology and an afterword.

Looking at coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text has multiple chapters but lacks clear transitions between them. It jumps from one chapter to another without connecting sentences or phrases that would help the reader understand the flow of events.

2) [LOGIC] Some parts of the text are repetitive or contain information that seems out of place in the narrative. For example, the text often digresses into descriptions of historical context that aren't clearly connected to Bradley's personal story.

3) [CLARITY] There are numerous instances of unclear references and missing information. The text uses phrases like "the thing" and "a stuff" repeatedly without explanation, which makes it difficult for readers to understand what is being referenced.

4) [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and chapters are often abrupt. The text moves from one topic to another without clear signposting or connecting words.

5) [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice shifts between first-person (Bradley speaking) and third-person (narrator describing Bradley) without clear indication, which can be confusing.

6) [ORGANIZATION] While the text follows a chronological order of Bradley's life, the organization within each chapter is sometimes disjointed, with information presented in a non-linear or inconsistent manner.

7) [COHERENCE] The text attempts to cover a vast amount of information about Bradley's life and work, but it often lacks a clear focus or central theme that would unify the content.

8) [CONTEXT] There are many references to historical events, people, and places that are not explained for readers who might not be familiar with them, making it harder to follow the narrative.

9) [PERSPECTIVE] The text switches between different perspectives - sometimes presenting Bradley's thoughts and experiences directly, and other times describing them from an external perspective - without clear transitions.

10) [FLOWS] The flow of the narrative is often interrupted by digressions, repetitions, and shifts in perspective that disrupt the reader's understanding of the main story.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2.5. The text has a basic chronological structure that provides some coherence, but the numerous issues with transitions, clarity, organization, and perspective significantly hinder the reader's ability to follow the narrative smoothly. The frequent use of vague references ("the thing" and "a stuff") and the lack of clear connections between ideas make the text challenging to follow, despite its potentially interesting content.

A score of 2.5 falls between "The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort" (Score 2) and "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience" (Score 3).
