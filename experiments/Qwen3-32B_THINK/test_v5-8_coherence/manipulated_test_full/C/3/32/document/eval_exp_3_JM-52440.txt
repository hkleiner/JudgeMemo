Let me analyze the given text to evaluate its coherence. The text is a theological work discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It has a clear structure with chapters and sections, and it presents arguments in a logical sequence.

First, I'll look for coherence issues:

1. [LOGIC] The text has a clear argumentative structure with a thesis and supporting points, but there are places where the logical flow is not always clear or direct. The author makes arguments but sometimes the connections between premises and conclusions are not explicitly stated.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured with chapters and sections, but the organization within some sections could be improved. The text jumps between discussing different aspects of the doctrine without always making the connections clear.

3. [CLARITY] Some passages are quite dense and use complex theological terminology that may not be accessible to all readers. The text assumes a high level of familiarity with theological concepts and historical context.

4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are not always smooth. The author often introduces new points without clear transitional phrases that would help the reader follow the argument.

5. [REPETITION] There is some repetition of points, which could be streamlined to improve coherence.

6. [CONTEXT] The text makes references to other documents (like the Articles of Religion, Catechism, etc.) without always providing sufficient context for readers who may not be familiar with these documents.

Now, let me evaluate the overall coherence using the scale provided:

The text has a clear thesis and generally follows a logical progression, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions and clarity in its arguments. The complex subject matter and dense writing style make it challenging for some readers to follow the argument consistently. There are some abrupt shifts in focus and some repetition of points.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent.

I would rate this text a 3.5. The text is generally coherent and follows a clear argument, but there are noticeable issues with transitions and clarity that affect the reading experience. The complex subject matter and dense writing style also contribute to some confusion.

Let me refine this assessment:

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The logical flow between some arguments is not always clear, with premises and conclusions sometimes disconnected.  
- [STRUCTURE] While the text has a clear overall structure, the organization within some sections is weak, with abrupt shifts between topics.  
- [CLARITY] The text uses complex theological terminology and assumes prior knowledge of specific documents and concepts, making it less accessible.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often weak or absent, making the progression of ideas feel disjointed.  
- [REPETITION] Some points are repeated unnecessarily, which could be streamlined to improve coherence.  
- [CONTEXT] References to specific Church of England documents and historical context are sometimes unclear or lack sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the subject.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
