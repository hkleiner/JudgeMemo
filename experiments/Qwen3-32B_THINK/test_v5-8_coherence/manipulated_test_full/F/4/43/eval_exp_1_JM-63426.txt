Alright, let's evaluate this long text for coherence.

First, I need to understand what the text is about. It appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer, written in the form of a chap book. The text is written in the first person (as if by an introduction writer) and then switches to a more narrative, first-person perspective as if telling the story of Will Bradley's life.

Now I'll check for coherence issues:

1) Structure: The text is divided into chapters, which is a good organizational structure. However, the flow between chapters is sometimes abrupt, especially between the introduction and the first chapter about Bradley's childhood.

2) Logic: The narrative moves chronologically through Bradley's life, which is logical. However, there are some confusing jumps in time and some unclear transitions between different periods in his life.

3) Clarity: Much of the text is clear and well-written, but there are some confusing passages and sentences that don't make much sense. I noticed several instances of what appears to be garbled text or misplaced words.

4) Transitions: There are some effective transitions between chapters, but others are abrupt or missing entirely. The text could benefit from more explicit transitions to help the reader follow the narrative flow.

5) Consistency: The narrative voice is consistent throughout the chapters about Bradley's life, but the introduction is written in a different voice, which creates a jarring shift.

6) Specific coherence issues I noticed:

- There are several passages that appear to be garbled or have words out of order, such as "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy."
- Some sentences are incomplete or seem to be cut off mid-thought.
- There are a few instances where the narrative jumps abruptly from one time period to another without clear transition.
- The text switches between first-person and second-person narration at times, which can be confusing.
- Some paragraphs seem to be incoherent or illogical in their flow.
- There are a few instances where the text appears to be missing words or has obvious typographical errors.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence of this text as follows:

It's mostly coherent with a clear chronological structure, but has several noticeable issues with garbled text, missing transitions, and some confusing shifts in perspective and voice. These issues, while not completely disrupting the overall understanding, do affect the reading experience and make the text less smooth and unified.

I would give this text a score of 3.5 on the coherence scale. It's generally coherent with a clear narrative thread, but has enough issues with garbled text, transitions, and consistency to prevent it from being a 4 or 5.

1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different periods in Will Bradley's life with minimal or no transitions, making it difficult to follow the chronological flow of events.
- [LOGIC] There are numerous instances of garbled text and misplaced words that disrupt the logical flow of the narrative (e.g., "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy").
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are incomplete or cut off mid-thought, reducing clarity (e.g., "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed.").
- [TRANSITION] The text shifts abruptly from a third-person introduction to a first-person narrative without clear indication, creating a jarring shift in perspective.
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice is inconsistent, switching between first-person and second-person narration at times, which can be confusing for the reader.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapters are generally well-structured, but the overall organization of the text could be improved with clearer connections between chapters and more explicit transitions between different periods in Bradley's life.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
