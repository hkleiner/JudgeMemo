Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text and provide a score from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand what coherence means in this context. Coherence refers to how well the sentences and ideas connect logically, forming a unified and organized whole. So, I need to check if the text flows smoothly and if the ideas are presented in a logical order.

Looking at the text, it's a long essay about the author's claim that a specific location in the US is the Garden of Eden based on biblical descriptions. The first thing I notice is the structure. The text starts with an introduction about the author's discovery and then goes into detailed descriptions of the geography, comparisons to biblical accounts, and refutations of other theories. However, there are several issues that stand out.

First, there are numerous grammatical errors. For example, the first paragraph has run-on sentences and missing commas. Phrases like "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." This is a bit awkward, but maybe not a huge issue. However, later parts have more severe problems. For instance, "Since of commenced idea not have my, but with reality possible, while are claiming mocked, publish becoming the to possible only others a being views impressed some its, highly I probable." This is a jumbled sentence that's hard to understand. So, [GRAMMAR] is definitely an issue here.

Next, the text has a lot of syntax issues. Some sentences are fragmented or run-on. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere. In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he, man family the the new one, to nor thus consequently in out or—and and been how Noah the the, of a principal facts that one and not—giving stated destroyed a him the on and to, to of how a his, since the country, admitted mankind and present location creation; it of the point find being, then them, a somewhere description not be gave; could, has first, and themselves simply knew where was kept, it was able them of with he antldiluvians cause location, and all earth corrupted though then profound speculation on." This is a long, convoluted sentence that's hard to parse. So, [SYNTAX] is another category of issues.

There's also a problem with clarity. The author often uses complex or unclear phrasing. For example, "The scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand, The work of the Deity, worthy his hand." The lack of commas and the abrupt shift in structure make it confusing. Additionally, the author jumps between different topics without clear transitions, making the flow of ideas disjointed. For instance, after discussing the geography, the author suddenly brings up a historical figure and then another theory, which doesn't smoothly connect. So, [CLARITY] and [TRANSITION] are issues here.

Looking at the structure, the text is very long and meandering. It starts with an introduction, then goes into detailed descriptions, comparisons, refutations of other theories, and ends with a conclusion. However, the flow isn't logical. There are repeated sections, like the author revisiting the same points multiple times without building on them. The lack of a clear outline or organization makes it hard to follow the author's argument. So, [STRUCTURE] is another issue.

Another problem is the use of jargon and unclear terms. The author uses terms like "antediluvian," "Lingula flag," and "Potsdam sandstone," which might be obscure to the general reader. Without context or explanation, these terms can confuse the reader and disrupt the flow. So, [LEXICON] is a category here.

The text also has logical inconsistencies. For example, the author claims the location is the Garden of Eden based on geographical features and biblical descriptions, but the arguments are not well-supported. The comparisons are often superficial, and the evidence presented is anecdotal rather than factual. This weakens the coherence of the argument. So, [LOGIC] is another category.

There are also some spelling errors, though they are fewer compared to the other issues. For example, "admirirg" instead of "admiring" and "euphonious" instead of "euphonious" (though that's correct). However, these are minor compared to the other problems. Still, [SPELLING] is a category here.

The author also uses a lot of hyperbole and subjective language, which can make the argument seem less credible. For instance, "we have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in nature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your attention to it." This type of language can distract from the main argument and reduce coherence.

In terms of transitions between paragraphs, the text often lacks smooth transitions. The author moves from one idea to another without clear connections, making it hard to see how each part relates to the overall argument. For example, after discussing the geological features, the author suddenly shifts to a historical anecdote about a lawyer, which doesn't logically follow. So, [TRANSITION] is definitely an issue.

The text also includes a lot of repetition. The author reiterates the same points multiple times, which can make the text feel redundant and unorganized. For example, the claim that the location is the Garden of Eden is mentioned several times without new supporting evidence each time. This repetition can confuse the reader and reduce coherence.

Additionally, the author uses complex metaphors and analogies that are not clearly explained. For instance, comparing the region to Palestine and the Garden of Eden using terms like "beau ideal" and "flowing with milk and honey" without sufficient context. These metaphors might not be clear to all readers, leading to confusion. So, [CLARITY] is again an issue here.

The text's conclusion is also problematic. The author ends with a call to action and a religious appeal, but the argument hasn't been sufficiently built up to support such a conclusion. The lack of a strong, logical conclusion further reduces the text's coherence.

Considering all these issues, the text has significant problems with grammar, syntax, clarity, structure, logic, transitions, and lexicon. These issues make the text difficult to follow and reduce its overall coherence. While there are some coherent parts, the cumulative effect of these problems leads to a lower score.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous run-on sentences, missing commas, and fragmented phrasing (e.g., "Since of commenced idea not have my, but with reality possible...").  
- [SYNTAX] Illogical sentence structures and convoluted syntax (e.g., "In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he...").  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing and unclear connections between ideas (e.g., "The scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand, The work of the Deity, worthy his hand").  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., sudden transitions from geography to historical anecdotes without transitions).  
- [LOGIC] Weak logical flow; arguments lack coherence and are often repetitive or unfocused (e.g., circular reasoning about the Garden of Eden’s location).  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of obscure or archaic terms (e.g., "antediluvian," "Lingula flag") without explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and sections, creating a disjointed reading experience.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
