Let me analyze the text for coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria. The text is a theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper.

First, I'll identify potential coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE]: The text has a clear structure with an introduction and three main chapters (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), but the flow between sections is not always smooth. The transition from one chapter to the next could be more clearly marked.

2) [LOGIC]: The argument is generally logical but becomes complex at times. The author frequently introduces counterarguments and refutations that could disrupt the logical flow if not clearly separated from the main argument.

3) [CLARITY]: Some sections are dense with theological terminology and complex sentence structures, making them less accessible to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.

4) [TRANSITION]: There are some abrupt transitions between ideas. For example, the text sometimes moves from one doctrinal point to another without clear transitional phrases.

5) [REPETITION]: The text occasionally repeats the same points in different sections, which could be seen as both reinforcing the argument and reducing coherence by being redundant.

6) [INCONSISTENCY]: The text sometimes presents ideas that seem slightly contradictory or at least in tension with one another, though these are generally addressed in the argument.

Now, let me look at specific coherence issues in more detail:

- [STRUCTURE]: While the text has a clear overall structure with an introduction and three chapters, the flow within chapters is sometimes disrupted by the author's tendency to address counterarguments in depth mid-paragraph rather than keeping the main argument moving forward.

- [LOGIC]: The author presents a clear thesis and supports it with evidence from various Church of England documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies). However, the logical flow is occasionally disrupted by the author's habit of addressing counterarguments in depth before returning to the main line of reasoning.

- [CLARITY]: The text uses complex theological language and concepts that may be difficult for readers without a background in Christian theology. The author also uses long, complex sentences that can be challenging to follow.

- [TRANSITION]: The text sometimes moves from one idea to another without clear transitional phrases. For example, the author might be discussing one doctrinal point and then suddenly shift to a different point without a clear indicator of the shift.

- [REPETITION]: The author occasionally repeats the same points in different sections, which can be confusing for the reader.

- [INCONSISTENCY]: There are some moments where the author's argument seems to contradict itself or present multiple interpretations of the same doctrine, though these are generally addressed in the text.

After considering these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 4. The text has a clear overall structure and presents a logical argument with supporting evidence. The author is generally consistent in their argument and addresses counterpoints. However, the complexity of the subject matter, the use of dense theological language, and some occasional issues with transitions and repetition prevent it from being a perfect 5.

The text is well-organized and the argument is generally clear, but the complexity and density of the content make it challenging to follow at times. The author's habit of addressing counterarguments in depth mid-paragraph sometimes disrupts the logical flow.

So my final assessment is:

1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The flow between sections is not always smooth and transitions could be clearer.
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally logical but becomes complex at times with frequent counterarguments.
- [CLARITY] The text uses complex theological terminology and has long, dense sentences that may be difficult for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between ideas.
- [REPETITION] The text occasionally repeats the same points in different sections.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
