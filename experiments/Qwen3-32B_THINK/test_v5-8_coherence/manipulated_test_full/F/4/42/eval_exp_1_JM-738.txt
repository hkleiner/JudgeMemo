Let me analyze this text for coherence. The text appears to be an analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It's a detailed examination of the plot, characters, and various theories about the mystery at the heart of the novel.

I'll identify coherence issues and then provide a score based on the evaluation criteria.

Coherence issues I notice:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure and progression of ideas. It moves between analysis of the plot, character analysis, and evaluation of various theories without clear transitions.

2) [LOGIC] The logical flow between sections is often unclear. Ideas jump from one point to another without clear connections. For example, the text discusses plot points, then shifts to character analysis, then to specific theories without clear signposting.

3) [CLARITY] The text is written in a very formal, archaic style that can be confusing to modern readers. The sentence structures are often complex and convoluted. For example, "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_."

4) [TRANSITION] There are few clear transitions between paragraphs or sections. The reader is often left to figure out how one point connects to the next. For example, the text moves from discussing characters to discussing theories about the mystery without clear connections.

5) [CONSISTENCY] The text shifts between first-person ("I proceed to the analysis of Dickens's last plot") and more objective analysis without clear indication of the author's perspective.

6) [READABILITY] The archaic language and complex sentence structures make the text difficult to read and understand, especially for modern readers. Phrases like "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow" are clear, but many others are more obscure.

7) [ORGANIZATION] While the text does follow a general structure of introduction, story summary, theories, and conclusion, the internal organization of these sections is not always clear. Ideas are sometimes presented out of order or without clear categorization.

8) [PERSPECTIVE] The text shifts between presenting the author's own theories and summarizing other people's theories without clear indication of which is which. This can be confusing for the reader.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as follows:

The text is generally coherent in that it does maintain a focus on analyzing Dickens's novel and presents a logical progression of ideas about the mystery. However, the complex language, lack of clear transitions, and occasional shifts in perspective and structure make it somewhat difficult to follow at times. The text contains noticeable abrupt shifts and could be more clearly organized.

Given these considerations, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5 out of 5. It's generally coherent but has noticeable issues with clarity, transitions, and organization that affect the reading experience.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear organization between sections, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] There are abrupt shifts between analysis of plot, character, and theories without clear connections.  
- [CLARITY] The archaic language and complex sentence structures reduce readability for modern readers.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and sections disrupts the flow.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text shifts between first-person perspective and objective analysis without clear distinction.  
- [READABILITY] The dense, formal style and long, convoluted sentences make the text challenging to follow.  
- [ORGANIZATION] While the text follows a general structure (introduction, story, theories, conclusion), the internal organization of these sections is inconsistent.  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text moves between presenting the author's theories and summarizing others without clear indication, causing confusion.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
