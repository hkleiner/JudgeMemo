Let me analyze the coherence of this text and identify any issues that might affect its score.

First, I'll read through the text to understand its structure and content:

The text appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. It's structured into several chapters that chronologically follow his life and career. The first chapter is an introduction written by someone else, followed by chapters that detail Bradley's life from his childhood to his retirement. There's also an afterword at the end.

Now I'll look for coherence issues:

1) Structure: 
- The text is generally well-structured with clear chapter divisions.
- The chronological progression of Bradley's life is logical and makes sense.
- There are some transitions between chapters that could be smoother, but overall the structure is coherent.

2) Logic:
- The narrative follows a logical sequence of events in Bradley's life.
- There are some minor inconsistencies in the timeline that could confuse readers, such as references to events that seem to occur out of order.
- Some paragraphs jump between different topics without clear transitions.

3) Clarity:
- The text is generally clear, though it contains some complex sentences that could be confusing.
- There are some instances where the meaning is not immediately clear, requiring rereading.
- The use of different tenses (first-person and second-person narratives) can be confusing at times.

4) Transitions:
- The transitions between paragraphs and chapters are sometimes abrupt.
- Some chapters begin with a scene that seems disconnected from the previous chapter.
- The text sometimes shifts suddenly from one topic to another without clear transitions.

5) Specific issues I've noticed:
- The text uses both first-person and second-person narration at different points, which can be confusing.
- There are some grammatical errors that affect clarity.
- Some sentences are very long and complex, making them hard to follow.
- There are some inconsistencies in the timeline of events.
- The text sometimes refers to events or people without proper introduction.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 3.5. The text has a clear overall structure and narrative, but there are noticeable issues with transitions, clarity, and some inconsistencies that affect the reading experience. The use of different tenses and some grammatical issues also contribute to the lower score.

Let me refine my assessment by listing specific coherence issues:

1) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different tenses and perspectives (first-person and second-person narratives) without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] Some chapters begin with a scene that seems disconnected from the previous chapter, creating abrupt transitions.
- [LOGIC] There are some inconsistencies in the timeline of events, which could confuse readers.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, especially the long, descriptive sentences.
- [TRANSITION] The text sometimes shifts suddenly from one topic to another without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some references to events or people appear without proper introduction, making them confusing for readers.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes seems to meander or repeat information unnecessarily.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long with many chapters, and it could benefit from clearer section breaks or headings to help with navigation.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
