Let me analyze the text according to the coherence criteria.

First, I need to identify any issues that might affect the coherence of the text:

1. I'll look for abrupt shifts in topic or focus.
2. I'll check for unclear transitions between paragraphs.
3. I'll assess if the ideas are logically connected.
4. I'll look for confusing or unclear segments.
5. I'll check if the text has a clear and logical progression.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:

[STRUCTURE] - The text is very long and dense with theological content, making it difficult to follow the overall structure. It's divided into chapters and sections, but the flow between these sections is not always clear.

[LOGIC] - The argument is complex and detailed, but at times the logical connections between ideas are not clearly stated. The author presents multiple theological positions and arguments, but the relationships between them could be more explicitly defined.

[CLARITY] - There are some passages where the meaning is not immediately clear. For example, the author discusses complex theological concepts like "transubstantiation," "real presence," and "spiritual presence" without always clearly defining these terms for a general reader.

[TRANSITION] - The transitions between paragraphs and sections are sometimes abrupt. The author often moves from one theological concept to another without clearly indicating the relationship between them.

[CONSISTENCY] - The text maintains a consistent focus on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England, which is positive for coherence. However, the author occasionally shifts between presenting facts, making arguments, and expressing personal opinions without clear demarcation.

[REPETITION] - There is some repetition of key points, which could be either helpful for emphasis or potentially confusing if the reader is not following the argument closely.

Now, I'll assess the text according to the evaluation scale:

Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.

Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.

Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.

Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.

Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

This text is quite coherent overall. It presents a clear thesis (analyzing the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper) and follows a logical structure (introduction, then chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice). The author maintains a consistent voice and argument throughout.

However, there are some issues that prevent it from being a perfect 5:
- The text is very dense and could be more clearly structured
- Some transitions between sections are abrupt
- The complex theological content could be more clearly explained for general readers
- The author occasionally shifts between presenting facts, making arguments, and expressing personal opinions without clear demarcation

Given these considerations, I would rate this text a 4 on the coherence scale. It's mostly coherent with a clear structure and logical progression, but there are some weak points in transitions and clarity that could be improved.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it challenging to follow the overall structure and flow of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Some logical connections between paragraphs and concepts are not clearly stated, especially in the theological arguments.  
- [CLARITY] Certain theological concepts (e.g., "transubstantiation," "real presence") are not consistently defined or explained for clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections and paragraphs are often abrupt, lacking clear signposts for the reader.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The author shifts between presenting facts, making arguments, and expressing personal opinions without clear demarcation.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
