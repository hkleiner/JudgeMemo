Let me analyze the text for coherence issues. The text appears to be the beginning of "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. I'll go through it and identify any issues that affect the coherence of the narrative.

First, I'll look for logical flow and how well the ideas connect. Coherence issues could include:

1. Sudden shifts in time or place that are not properly explained
2. Contradictory information
3. Missing information that would help the reader understand the narrative
4. Unconnected or disjointed paragraphs
5. Confusing transitions between ideas

Looking through the text:

1. The narrative has a clear beginning, with Mr. Otis purchasing Canterville Chase despite being warned about the ghost.
2. The characters are introduced in a logical sequence.
3. The plot develops in a linear fashion, with clear cause and effect.

However, I do notice some minor issues that affect coherence:

- Some sentences have grammatical errors that make them harder to follow.
- There are occasional shifts in tense that are not always consistent.
- A few sentences have awkward constructions that disrupt the flow.

Let me go through the text more carefully to identify specific issues:

1) [GRAMMAR] "had been spilt on that spot" - This is grammatically correct, but the overall sentence could be clearer.
2) [GRAMMAR] "coulded was seen" - This is a grammatical error.
3) [GRAMMAR] "had been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed" - This sentence has a shift in tense and a grammatical issue.
4) [GRAMMAR] "It must be removed at once." - This is clear, but the previous sentence has issues.
5) [GRAMMAR] "In a few moments no trace of the blood-stain coulded was seen." - This sentence has multiple grammatical issues.
6) [GRAMMAR] "He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appeared again." - This is clear, but the previous sentence has issues.
