Let me analyze the text and evaluate its coherence based on the given criteria.

The text appears to be a critical analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". It contains an introduction, a detailed summary of the story, and an analysis of various theories regarding the plot and characters.

I'll look for coherence issues across the text:

1) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure. It lacks clear sectioning that would help the reader navigate the content.
- [LOGIC] The logical flow between paragraphs is sometimes unclear. The text jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] The writing is often convoluted and uses complex sentence structures that make it hard to follow the arguments being made.
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases to guide the reader through the logical progression of ideas.
- [ORGANIZATION] The organization of the text is somewhat haphazard. It starts with an introduction, then moves to a summary of the story, then to analysis of theories, but the flow between these sections is not always smooth.
- [COHERENCE] The text attempts to cover multiple theories and interpretations, but the connections between these ideas are not always clearly explained.
- [FOCUS] The text sometimes loses focus, going off on tangents before returning to the main discussion.
- [CONNECTION] Some paragraphs are not clearly connected to the overall argument or purpose of the text.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The author shifts between different perspectives and interpretations without clear indication of which viewpoint they personally support.
- [SEQUENCE] The sequence of ideas is sometimes confusing, with later paragraphs referring to earlier concepts without sufficient context.

2) Final Coherence Score:
Considering the evaluation criteria and the issues identified, I would rate this text as a 2.5 on the coherence scale. The text attempts to make a coherent argument about the novel, but it suffers from significant coherence issues. The logical flow is often unclear, the organization is haphazard, and the complex writing style makes it difficult to follow the arguments. While the content is relevant and the author is clearly knowledgeable about the topic, the text lacks the smooth progression and clear connections that would make it a highly coherent piece of writing.
