Let me analyze this text for coherence according to the given criteria.

First, I need to identify any coherence issues in the text. Coherence is about how well the sentences and ideas connect logically to form a unified and well-organized whole.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense with theological content. While it's well-structured in that it follows a logical progression (introduction, then examining the Real Presence, then Adoration, then Sacrifice), the sheer length and density may make it difficult for readers to follow the argument.

2) [LOGIC] The text presents a clear argument against the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England, but there are occasional logical leaps or assumptions that may not be immediately apparent to all readers. For example, the author sometimes assumes the reader will understand the historical and theological context of the Reformation and the Church of England's documents.

3) [CLARITY] Some of the writing is quite complex and uses archaic language (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" or "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church"). This may reduce clarity for modern readers.

4) [TRANSITION] While there are clear section headings, the transitions between some paragraphs are not always smooth. The author sometimes moves from one idea to another without clear transitional phrases.

5) [REPETITION] There is some repetition of key points, which is understandable given the nature of the argument, but it could be more efficiently organized.

6) [TONE] The author's tone is often polemical, which is appropriate for the subject matter but may make the text feel more confrontational than analytical at times.

7) [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues that could affect readability, though these are minor.

8) [SPELLING] I notice a few spelling errors (e.g., "vlindly" instead of "blindly", "experiejced" instead of "experienced", "het" instead of "yet"), but these are relatively minor and don't significantly impact the overall coherence.

9) [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues, such as missing articles or incorrect verb forms, but again, these are minor and don't significantly affect the overall coherence.

10) [ORGANIZATION] The text is well-organized in its overall structure, with clear sections and a logical progression of ideas. The author follows a clear argumentative structure: introduction, examination of the Real Presence, examination of Adoration, and examination of Sacrifice.

Based on these observations, I would rate this text as mostly coherent but with some minor issues that affect the flow and clarity. The text has a clear structure and logical progression, but the complex language, occasional logical leaps, and minor grammatical issues prevent it from being highly coherent.

I would rate this text a 4. The text is mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts, but these do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense with theological content. - [LOGIC] There are occasional logical leaps or assumptions that may not be immediately apparent to all readers. - [CLARITY] The writing is complex and uses archaic language that may reduce clarity for modern readers. - [TRANSITION] Some paragraph transitions are not always smooth. - [REPETITION] There is some repetition of key points. - [TONE] The author's polemical tone may make the text feel more confrontational than analytical. - [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues that could affect readability. - [SPELLING] There are a few spelling errors. - [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
