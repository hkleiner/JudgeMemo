Let me analyze the given text for coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I need to understand what the text is about. It appears to be an author's claim that they have discovered the location of the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley in the United States. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with many references to the Bible and attempts to match biblical descriptions with geographical features in the US.

Now, I'll identify the coherence issues in the text:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, logical structure. It jumps between different topics and points without clear transitions. The author starts by discussing their discovery, then moves to biblical interpretations, then to descriptions of the landscape, then to other people's theories, then back to their own claims, etc.

2) [LOGIC] There are numerous logical inconsistencies. The author makes claims that don't follow from their evidence, and often presents speculative interpretations as facts. For example, they claim to have found the Garden of Eden based on superficial similarities between geographical features and biblical descriptions.

3) [CLARITY] The text is often confusing and difficult to follow. The author uses complex and archaic language, and the meaning is often obscured by poor sentence structure and lack of clear focus.

4) [TRANSITION] There are very few effective transitions between ideas. The text jumps from one topic to another without connecting sentences or phrases that would help the reader follow the flow of ideas.

5) [COHERENCE] The overall text lacks coherence. The author's central claim is clear, but the supporting arguments are disjointed and often contradictory. The text reads more like a series of disconnected observations than a coherent argument.

6) [SPELLING] There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "th" instead of "the", "tje" instead of "the", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "howevwr" instead of "however", etc.

7) [GRAMMAR] There are many grammatical errors, including missing words, incorrect verb forms, and improper sentence structure.

8) [SYNTAX] The sentence structures are often complex and difficult to follow, with run-on sentences and missing punctuation.

9) [ORGANIZATION] The text lacks clear organization. It reads more like a stream of consciousness than a logically structured argument.

10) [REPETITION] The author repeats many points and ideas throughout the text without developing or refining them.

11) [PERSUASION] The author often shifts between presenting the text as a scholarly argument and as a persuasive piece, which creates confusion about the author's intent.

12) [TONE] The tone is inconsistent, shifting between academic, promotional, and almost desperate to convince the reader.

Based on these issues, I need to determine the final coherence score. The text is clearly attempting to make a claim, but the way it is presented makes it extremely difficult to follow. There are numerous structural issues, logical problems, and clarity problems that significantly affect the overall coherence.

I would rate this text as a 2.5 on the coherence scale. It has some coherence in that the central claim is clear and there are some logical connections between related ideas. However, the frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and confusing structure make it difficult to follow the author's argument as a whole. The text would be challenging for readers to understand without extra effort.

Let me refine this assessment:

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Text lacks clear organization and logical flow. Ideas jump between discovery claims, biblical interpretations, landscape descriptions, and critiques of other theories without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Contains numerous logical inconsistencies and weak argumentation. Claims are made without proper evidence or reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] Often confusing and difficult to follow due to archaic language, complex sentence structures, and lack of focus.  
- [TRANSITION] Very few effective transitions between ideas; text jumps abruptly from one topic to another.  
- [COHERENCE] Overall text lacks coherence. The central claim is clear but the supporting arguments are disjointed and contradictory.  
- [SPELLING] Numerous spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "thr", "tje", "dimentions", "howevwr").  
- [GRAMMAR] Many grammatical errors including missing words, incorrect verb forms, and improper sentence structure.  
- [SYNTAX] Complex and difficult-to-follow sentence structures with run-on sentences and missing punctuation.  
- [ORGANIZATION] Lacks clear organization; reads more like a stream of consciousness than a structured argument.  
- [REPETITION] Repeats many points and ideas without development or refinement.  
- [PERSUASION] Inconsistent tone shifting between scholarly argument and promotional text.  
- [TONE] Inconsistent tone that shifts between academic, promotional, and desperate to convince the reader.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
