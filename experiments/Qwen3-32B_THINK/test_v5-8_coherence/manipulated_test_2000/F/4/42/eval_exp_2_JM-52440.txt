Alright, let's break down the user's request. They want me to evaluate a text for coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half points allowed. The text is a religious work discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Coherence is about how well the sentences and ideas flow logically, forming a unified whole. The scale ranges from 5 (highly coherent) to 1 (largely incoherent). 

Looking at the text, it's a formal theological treatise. The structure seems to be an introduction followed by chapters. The introduction sets up the problem: people are asserting the Church of England teaches the Real Presence without proper evidence. The author's goal is to examine the Church's documents to verify this claim. 

Now, checking for coherence issues. The text is dense with theological terminology and arguments. I need to look for abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments. 

First, the introduction mentions "the object of this address" but doesn't clearly outline the structure of the argument. The transition to Chapter I is direct without summarizing the introduction's purpose. 

In Chapter I, the author discusses the Real Presence, contrasting it with Roman Catholic views. The argument is logical but sometimes jumps between points. For example, after stating the two systems (Real Presence vs. spiritual feeding), the author shifts to the Church's current state without clear transition. 

There are some grammatical errors that might affect readability, like "teach" instead of "teaches" and "was" instead of "is." These are [GRAMMAR] issues. Also, terms like "the most bless Saviour" should be "blessed" [SPELLING]. 

The text uses complex sentences which might cause [CLARITY] issues. For example, "But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest possible divergence." The word "connexion" is archaic and might be unclear to modern readers. 

The structure moves from introduction to the Real Presence, then to the Articles of the Church. Each section is coherent within itself, but the flow between sections could be smoother. The author mentions examining the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies but only discusses the Articles in detail, leaving the others unaddressed. This might be a [STRUCTURE] issue as it's unclear if the other documents will be covered later.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a clear purpose and logical progression within sections. However, there are some grammatical errors, archaic terms affecting clarity, and transitions that could be smoother. These issues don't severely disrupt understanding but are noticeable. 

Considering the scale, the text would likely be a 3.5 or 4. Let me check the criteria again. Score 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts." The issues I noted are present but don't significantly hinder understanding. The main ideas are clear, and the argument is logical despite some flaws. So a 4 seems appropriate.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction abruptly transitions to Chapter I without clearly signaling the shift or establishing the text’s overall structure.  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of archaic/ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "was the real point at issue," "it is not my business now to discuss") creates confusion about the author’s focus.  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally shifts between theological claims and meta-commentary on the Church’s authority without clear transitions (e.g., discussing the Church’s "sifting time" mid-analysis).  
- [GRAMMAR] Frequent subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the Church of England... am the true expositors," "the real groundwork of that opinion am examined").  
- [SPELLING] Misspellings (e.g., "bless Saviour" instead of "blessed Saviour," "was the sons of God" instead of "to be the sons of God").  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts between doctrinal analysis and polemical statements (e.g., "Some was endeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it..." after detailed scriptural discussion) disrupt logical flow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
The text maintains a central argument about the Church of England’s doctrine but suffers from grammatical errors, archaic phrasing, and abrupt transitions that hinder clarity and logical progression. While the structure is somewhat coherent within sections, the overall flow is fragmented by inconsistent tone and unresolved shifts in focus.
