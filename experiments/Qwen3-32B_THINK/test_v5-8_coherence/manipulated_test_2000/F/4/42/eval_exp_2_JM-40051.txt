Let me analyze this text for coherence issues. Coherence refers to how well the sentences and ideas connect to form a unified, logical whole. I'll identify issues that disrupt the flow and logical progression of the text.

Looking at the text:

1) The text appears to be a religious/historical argument about the location of the Garden of Eden, specifically claiming it's in the Mississippi River valley between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

2) The text has several coherence issues:

- [LOGIC] The author presents multiple claims about the location of Eden without clear logical connections between them. For example, the transition from discussing biblical descriptions to making specific geographic claims is abrupt and lacks clear justification.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the argument. The author claims to have discovered the location of Eden, but the evidence presented is largely subjective and circumstantial.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure. It jumps between different topics (biblical references, geography, local history) without clear transitions or organization.
- [LOGIC] The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's characteristics (e.g., "should be destitute of money mineral wealth") without providing clear reasoning for these assertions.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous unclear or ambiguous statements that make it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.
- [LOGIC] The author presents a series of observations about the landscape but doesn't clearly show how these observations support the claim that this is the Garden of Eden.
- [LOGIC] There are contradictions in the author's statements. For example, the author claims to be making a discovery but also presents this as something that "has been pointed to" by others.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a strong claim (that this is the Garden of Eden) but provides weak evidence to support it.
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be written in a disjointed manner, with ideas introduced and then abandoned or contradicted later.
- [LOGIC] The author makes several unsupported assumptions about what the Garden of Eden must have been like, which are then used to argue that this specific location matches those assumptions.
- [LOGIC] The text contains numerous logical fallacies, such as appeals to emotion and circular reasoning.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a series of vague and subjective claims about the beauty and significance of the location without clearly connecting these to the argument that this is the Garden of Eden.
- [LOGIC] There is a lack of clear evidence or reasoning to support the author's central claim.
- [LOGIC] The author presents a series of observations about the landscape but doesn't clearly show how these observations support the claim that this is the Garden of Eden.
- [LOGIC] The text contains numerous claims that are not clearly supported by the evidence presented.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a series of vague and subjective claims about the beauty and significance of the location without clearly connecting these to the argument that this is the Garden of Eden.
- [LOGIC] The text contains numerous logical inconsistencies and unsupported assumptions.
- [LOGIC] The author presents a series of observations about the landscape but doesn't clearly show how these observations support the claim that this is the Garden of Eden.
- [LOGIC] The text contains numerous logical fallacies, such as appeals to emotion and circular reasoning.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a strong claim (that this is the Garden of Eden) but provides weak evidence to support it.
- [LOGIC] The text contains numerous unsupported assumptions about what the Garden of Eden must have been like, which are then used to argue that this specific location matches those assumptions.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a series of vague and subjective claims about the beauty and significance of the location without clearly connecting these to the argument that this is the Garden of Eden.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 2.5 out of 5. The text has a clear central claim (that the Garden of Eden is located in the Mississippi River valley), but the argument is largely incoherent due to the logical issues, lack of clear structure, and weak evidence presented. The author jumps between different topics and makes unsupported assumptions without clearly connecting them to the central claim. While the text is readable, the logical flow is weak and the argument is not well-supported.

However, I should revise my rating. Let me look at the scale again:

- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression.

Given the numerous logical issues and weak argumentation, I believe a 2 is more appropriate than 2.5. The text is attempting to make a specific argument but fails to do so in a coherent manner due to the many logical problems and lack of clear organization.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The author presents multiple claims about the location of Eden without clear logical connections between them.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the argument.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure.
- [LOGIC] The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's characteristics without providing clear reasoning.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous unclear or ambiguous statements.
- [LOGIC] The author presents a series of observations about the landscape but doesn't clearly show how these support the claim that this is the Garden of Eden.
- [LOGIC] There are contradictions in the author's statements.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a strong claim but provides weak evidence to support it.
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be written in a disjointed manner.
- [LOGIC] The author makes several unsupported assumptions about what the Garden of Eden must have been like.
- [LOGIC] The text contains numerous logical fallacies.
- [LOGIC] The author makes a series of vague and subjective claims without clearly connecting them to the argument.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

Let me review one more time to ensure my assessment is accurate. I believe a score of 2 is appropriate because the text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing. While the text is readable and has a central claim, the argument is largely incoherent due to the many logical problems and lack of clear organization.
