Alright, I'm going to analyze this text according to the coherence criteria provided. Let me read through the text carefully and identify any issues with its coherence.

First, I need to understand what coherence means in this context. Coherence refers to how well the sentences and ideas connect to form a unified whole, with logical progression and smooth transitions.

Looking at the text, I notice it's a biographical introduction and story of Will Bradley, an American graphic artist. It has two main chapters: an introduction and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." 

Let me identify any issues with coherence:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. The introduction discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts and then abruptly shifts to his childhood in Ishpeming without a clear connection.

2) [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes presents events in a confusing order. For example, it mentions Bradley's later career and influence before fully establishing his early life and development as an artist.

3) [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or confusing. For instance, "In this field we have never have any more indigenous art than Bradley’s" is awkwardly phrased and hard to understand.

4) [TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the second chapter is abrupt. The second chapter about Bradley's childhood is presented as a separate story without clear connection to the previous discussion of his professional impact.

5) [LOGIC] There are some inconsistencies in time references. The text mentions "In the Nineties" and "the early Eighties" but doesn't clearly establish how these periods relate to Bradley's life and career timeline.

6) [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure that mixes narrative elements with more analytical commentary. This creates a disjointed reading experience as it switches between storytelling and analysis without clear demarcation.

7) [CLARITY] Some phrases are confusing or contain grammatical errors that affect coherence. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" and "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep" are awkward and unclear.

8) [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information in a way that doesn't build logically. For example, it discusses Bradley's retirement and current status before fully establishing his career timeline.

9) [TRANSITION] There are several instances where the narrative shifts abruptly without clear transitions. For example, the text moves from discussing Bradley's professional impact to his childhood in Ishpeming without a clear bridge.

10) [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, which affects the overall coherence. For example, "So he spread his work over magazines, newspapers, the advertising of such houses as the Strathmore Paper Company, his own lively but not limited publications, even the movies" is a long, complex sentence that could be clearer.

11) [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information in a way that seems contradictory or confusing. For example, it mentions that Bradley's work was "absorbed into our culture so completely that many of the young men cavorted brilliantly in his wake today are scarcely aware of their debt to him," but then states "he is aware of them: he closed here with chuckling praises of the fine, free-handed job they are doing" which creates some confusion about the timeline.

12) [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with multiple narrative threads that aren't clearly connected. The introduction discusses Bradley's professional impact, then shifts to his childhood, and then returns to his professional legacy without a clear narrative flow.

Based on these issues, I need to determine the final coherence score. The text has several coherence problems but it's still generally understandable. The narrative is mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text overall, but they do create some confusion and disrupt the logical progression at times.

Given the evaluation scale, I would rate this text as a 3.5. It has noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience, but it's still mostly coherent and understandable.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Bradley's professional impact to his childhood in Ishpeming without clear transitions or logical connections between the two sections.  
- [LOGIC] The timeline is sometimes confusing, with mentions of "the Nineties" and "the early Eighties" presented without clear context or progression.  
- [CLARITY] Several sentences are awkwardly phrased or grammatically incorrect, such as "It shoulded be talked about" and "In this field we have never have any more indigenous art than Bradley’s," which disrupt understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the introductory section and the second chapter ("The Boy Printer of Ishpeming") is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative bridge.  
- [LOGIC] Some claims are presented without sufficient context, such as the mention of Theodore Roosevelt's libel trial, which feels disconnected from the main narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text mixes narrative storytelling with analytical commentary in an uneven way, creating a disjointed reading experience.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
