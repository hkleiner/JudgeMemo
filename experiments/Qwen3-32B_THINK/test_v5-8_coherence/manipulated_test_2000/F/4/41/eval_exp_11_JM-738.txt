Okay, I need to evaluate the coherence of this text. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The text is an analysis of Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It begins with an introduction discussing Dickens's approach to plot construction in his later works, then moves into the story's characters and plot summary. The author also references other critics and their theories about the unresolved plot.

First, I'll look for coherence issues. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow and connect logically. 

The introduction mentions Forster's views on Dickens's construction, then shifts to character and humor. There's a transition to Dickens's health and how it affected his writing. This part is a bit abrupt. Also, when discussing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," the author jumps into character descriptions without a smooth transition from the previous discussion about Dickens's health and style.

In the "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" section, there's a detailed explanation of the characters and their relationships. However, the flow from the introduction to the character list is a bit jarring. The text should probably have a smoother transition here to connect the analysis of Dickens's writing style to the specific characters in the novel.

The "OPENING OF THE TALE" section starts with a vision from Jasper, which is part of the story's plot. The connection between the character descriptions and the opening scene could be clearer. The author mentions the cathedral tower's importance but doesn't explicitly link it to the previous character setup, which might confuse readers.

There are some instances of unclear transitions between paragraphs. For example, after discussing the Dean and Minor Canon Crisparkle, the next paragraph jumps to Jasper's dinner with Edwin. A sentence explaining the shift in setting or focus would help.

Also, the text references other critics like R. A. Proctor and Mr. Cuming Walters. These mentions are relevant to the analysis but are introduced without much context, making it a bit confusing for readers unfamiliar with these critics. A brief explanation of their theories or how they relate to the author's analysis would improve coherence.

There are a few grammatical errors and typos that might distract from the flow, but the main issue is the structure and transitions between sections. The author moves from discussing Dickens's style to character analysis to plot summary without clear signposting, which could make it harder to follow the overall argument.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a logical structure, but there are areas where transitions are abrupt or unclear. The author provides a thorough analysis, but smoother connections between sections would enhance the coherence.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Dickens's health discussion to detailed character analysis without clear contextual linkage.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift to "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" section after introduction lacks smooth connection to prior analysis.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between Jasper's opium use and his role in the plot; implications need stronger explanation.  
- [CLARITY] References to critics (Proctor, Walters) introduced without sufficient context for their relevance to the analysis.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow between character descriptions and narrative progression (e.g., cathedral tower's significance not explicitly tied to earlier setup).  
- [TRANSITION] Jump from character relationships to "OPENING OF THE TALE" lacks explanatory bridge.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
