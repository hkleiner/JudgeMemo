Okay, let me try to figure out how to rate the coherence of this text. The user wants me to list issues that affect coherence and then give a score from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to understand what coherence means here. From the evaluation criterion, coherence is about whether the sentences make sense as a whole, with logical connections and organization. The scale ranges from 5 (highly coherent) to 1 (largely incoherent). 

Looking at the text, the author is claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. The text is quite long and seems to be a mix of personal discovery, biblical references, and descriptions of the area. 

I'll start by scanning for coherence issues. Let me go through the text again and note any problems.

1. **Structure Issues**: The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. For example, the author starts with the discovery, then discusses biblical context, then moves to geographical descriptions. There's no clear progression or organization. This could be a [STRUCTURE] issue.

2. **Logical Flow**: The argument seems to have logical gaps. For instance, the author equates the Mississippi River with the Euphrates based on their names and physical features, but this connection isn't well-supported. The reasoning is presented without sufficient evidence or explanation, which might be a [LOGIC] problem.

3. **Repetition**: The author repeats points multiple times, like emphasizing the location of Eden in the "North West" and the description of the hanging garden. While repetition can be used for emphasis, excessive repetition can disrupt the flow and make the text feel redundant. This could be a [CLARITY] issue.

4. **Inconsistent Details**: There are inconsistencies in the details provided. For example, the author mentions specific locations and measurements but then contradicts them later. For instance, the garden is described as 35 miles long but also as 2,000 miles in the valley. These inconsistencies can confuse the reader and affect coherence. This might be a [LOGIC] or [CLARITY] issue.

5. **Unrelated Segments**: Some parts of the text seem disconnected. The discussion about rattlesnakes and the Indian name "rattlesnake hills" is inserted without a clear link to the main argument about Eden. This could be a [STRUCTURE] or [LOGIC] issue.

6. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors that might not directly affect coherence but can make the text harder to follow. For example, "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "princopak" instead of "principal," "locayion" instead of "location," etc. These are [SPELLING] and [GRAMMAR] issues, but the user is specifically asking for coherence, so maybe these are not the main focus. However, if these errors disrupt understanding, they might contribute to incoherence. But I'll focus on the coherence-related issues as per the instructions.

7. **Overuse of Metaphors**: The author uses a lot of metaphors and comparisons (e.g., comparing the Mississippi to the Euphrates, the garden to a crescent moon) without clearly explaining their relevance. This could confuse the reader and make the argument less coherent. This might be a [CLARITY] or [LOGIC] issue.

8. **Lack of Clear Thesis**: The text starts with a claim but doesn't clearly outline the evidence or structure of the argument. The reader has to piece together the logic from various parts of the text, which can make it incoherent. This is a [STRUCTURE] or [LOGIC] issue.

9. **Tangents**: The author goes on tangents, such as the discussion about the city of La Crosse and its industries, which don't directly support the main argument about Eden. These tangents can disrupt the flow. This is a [STRUCTURE] or [LOGIC] issue.

10. **Inconsistent Use of Evidence**: The author cites some evidence (e.g., the presence of rattlesnakes as the "serpent") but doesn't consistently apply this method throughout the text. Some claims are made without supporting evidence, which can make the argument seem weak and incoherent. This is a [LOGIC] issue.

Now, considering the scale for coherence. The text has several coherence issues: structure, logic, clarity, and some inconsistencies. However, the main argument is somewhat present, and the author is trying to make a case, albeit with many problems. 

The text is not entirely incoherent, but the issues are significant enough that a reader would have to work to follow the argument. According to the scale, a score of 3 is "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience." The text has noticeable shifts and unclear transitions, so a 3 seems appropriate. However, if the issues are more severe, maybe a 2.5. But the author is making a coherent argument, just with many flaws. 

Given the number of issues and how they affect the flow, I think a score of 3 is reasonable. The text is generally coherent but has enough problems to affect the reading experience.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes.  
- [LOGIC] Weak or unsupported reasoning when equating the Mississippi River to the Euphrates and the described valley to Eden.  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive emphasis on the same claims without progressing the argument.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent details (e.g., conflicting measurements of the valley’s size).  
- [LOGIC] Unrelated segments (e.g., discussion of rattlesnakes) inserted without clear connection to the main argument.  
- [LOGIC] Overreliance on metaphorical comparisons without explaining their relevance to the thesis.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thesis or roadmap for the argument, requiring readers to infer connections.  
- [CLARITY] Confusing tangents (e.g., descriptions of La Crosse’s industries) that divert from the central claim.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
