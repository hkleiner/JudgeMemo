Let me analyze this text for coherence issues and determine an appropriate score.

First, I'll read through the text to understand what it's about. It appears to be a 19th-century account of someone claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in what is now the American Midwest (Wisconsin and Minnesota). The author provides a detailed description of the landscape they believe corresponds with biblical descriptions of Eden.

Now let me identify coherence issues:

1) STRUCTURE - The text lacks a clear, logical structure. It jumps between different topics without clear organization or transitions. There's no clear introduction, development, or conclusion.

2) LOGIC - There are logical inconsistencies. The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's location based on questionable interpretations of biblical texts and geography.

3) CLARITY - The text is often unclear or ambiguous. The author uses phrases like "the thing" repeatedly without explanation, and refers to "stuff" in multiple places without clarification.

4) TRANSITION - There are poor or missing transitions between ideas. The text jumps from one topic to another without connecting sentences or phrases.

5) REPETITION - The author frequently repeats the same ideas and descriptions, which disrupts the flow of the text.

6) INCONSISTENCIES - There are inconsistencies in the narrative, such as when the author claims to have discovered Eden but then references others who have already suggested the American continent as a possible location.

7) CONTEXT - The text often lacks sufficient context for the reader to understand the author's references and assumptions, particularly about biblical geography and local history.

8) FOCUS - The text lacks a clear focus. It shifts between describing the landscape, making theological claims, and providing historical information without a cohesive purpose.

9) COHESION - The ideas in the text don't cohere well. The author introduces concepts and then doesn't follow through or connect them to the overall argument.

10) REDUNDANCY - There is significant redundancy in the descriptions of the landscape and the author's claims.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2.5 out of 5. The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing that make it difficult to follow without extra effort. While there is some organization in the descriptions of the landscape, the overall argument is weak and the text lacks a clear structure that would make the ideas flow logically. The repeated use of "the thing" and "stuff" without explanation further disrupts the coherence. The author's claims about the Garden of Eden are not well-supported or logically developed.
