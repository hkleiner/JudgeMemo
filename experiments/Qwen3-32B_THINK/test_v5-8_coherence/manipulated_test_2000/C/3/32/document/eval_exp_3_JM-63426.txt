Let me analyze this text for coherence. The text appears to be an introduction and first chapter of a book about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist. I'll identify issues related to coherence:

1) [LOGIC] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to describing his childhood in Ishpeming without clear connection.

2) [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is disjointed. The introduction discusses Bradley's career and impact, then the second chapter abruptly shifts to a detailed narrative of his childhood in Ishpeming without clear connection to the previous content.

3) [CLARITY] There are several instances where the meaning is unclear due to missing context or references. For example, "the thing" appears multiple times without being identified, making the text confusing.

4) [LOGIC] Some statements lack clear logical connections. For instance, the text describes Bradley's early work having "derivative traces" but then immediately states "whose hasn't?" without explaining what this means in context.

5) [LOGIC] There are inconsistencies in the narrative. The text shifts from a formal introduction about Bradley's impact on graphic arts to a detailed, almost fictionalized account of his childhood with specific, personal details that aren't clearly connected to the broader themes.

6) [LOGIC] The text mentions several historical figures and events but doesn't clearly establish their relevance to Bradley's story. For example, it references Morris, Beardsley, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Cezanne but doesn't clearly explain how they relate to Bradley's work.

7) [CLARITY] The text uses phrases like "the thing" repeatedly, which is confusing as it never clarifies what "the thing" refers to in each context.

8) [LOGIC] The narrative about Bradley's childhood seems to be presented as a fictionalized account rather than a factual biography, which is inconsistent with the introduction's more analytical tone.

9) [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the introduction and the first chapter, making the shift in tone and content abrupt and disorienting.

Based on these issues, I need to determine a coherence score:

The text has significant coherence issues. It jumps between different narrative styles and topics without clear connections. There are confusing references and a lack of logical flow between sections. The structure is disjointed, with the introduction and first chapter feeling like separate works that don't connect well.

However, each section does maintain internal coherence. The introduction has a clear focus on Bradley's impact on graphic arts, and the childhood narrative is coherent within itself.

Given these factors, I would rate the overall coherence as a 2.5. The text is difficult to follow due to the abrupt shifts in style, content, and perspective, and the confusing references, but it's not completely incoherent as each section has some internal logic.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from analytical introduction about Bradley's impact on graphic arts to a detailed, fictionalized childhood narrative without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure with two distinct sections (introduction and first chapter) that feel disconnected in style and purpose  
- [CLARITY] Repeated use of "the thing" without clarification, creating confusion about references  
- [LOGIC] Unclear relevance of historical figures (Morris, Beardsley, Toulouse-Lautrec) to Bradley's story  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent narrative style - shifts between formal analysis and almost fictionalized childhood account  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the introduction and the first chapter, causing disorientation  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between Bradley's childhood experiences and his later career as an artist  
- [CLARITY] Some statements lack context (e.g., "the NARROW GAUGE" without explanation)  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
