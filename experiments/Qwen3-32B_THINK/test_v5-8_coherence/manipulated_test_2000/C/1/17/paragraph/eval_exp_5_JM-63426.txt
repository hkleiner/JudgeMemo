Alright, let's see. I need to evaluate the text for coherence using the given criteria. The text is a chapter from a book about Will Bradley, focusing on his early life and career. 

First, I'll look for issues that affect coherence. The main problem seems to be the sudden shift in the middle of the text. The first part is about Bradley's impact on American graphic arts and his career, but then there's a section that describes a scene involving characters named Stransom, Paul Creston, and Mary Antrim. This scene doesn't seem related to Bradley at all. It feels like an unrelated story inserted in the middle. 

Next, after that scene, the text returns to talking about Bradley's later years and legacy. Then there's a chapter titled "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," which is about Bradley's childhood. But within this chapter, there's a paragraph about Sir Simon and a blood-stain at the Chase, which again seems unrelated. 

So the main coherence issues are these abrupt shifts to unrelated topics. The text jumps from Bradley's career to a fictional scene involving other characters, then back to Bradley, and then includes a paragraph about a different story. These shifts disrupt the logical flow and make it confusing for the reader. 

Are there any other issues? Maybe some unclear transitions between sections. For example, after the unrelated scene with Stransom and Creston, the text suddenly moves to Bradley's retirement and legacy. There's no clear connection or transition. Similarly, the paragraph about Sir Simon in the middle of Bradley's childhood story is jarring and doesn't contribute to the narrative about Bradley's early life.

Are there any other coherence problems? The structure seems to have multiple disconnected parts. The text starts as an introduction, then goes into Bradley's impact, then an unrelated scene, then back to Bradley's later years, then a new chapter about his childhood with another unrelated paragraph. The overall structure is fragmented.

Considering the evaluation criteria, a score of 3 would be "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience." The text has these issues with multiple abrupt shifts and unrelated content. However, there are parts that are coherent, like the sections focused on Bradley's career and childhood. But the presence of the unrelated scenes significantly affects the flow. 

I should check if there are any minor issues I missed. The text is written in a narrative style, which might contribute to some confusion, but the main problem is the structure and the unrelated content. 

So the coherence issues are the abrupt shifts and the inclusion of unrelated scenes. The final score would be 3 because the text is generally coherent in the sections that focus on Bradley, but the abrupt shifts and unrelated content make it noticeable and affect the reading experience.

1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing Will Bradley's career to an unrelated narrative about Stransom and Paul Creston in a London setting.  
- [LOGIC] Insertion of a paragraph about "Sir Simon" and a haunted Chase with blood-stains appears disconnected from Bradley's childhood story.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the unrelated London scene back to Bradley's retirement and legacy without explanation.  
- [COHESION] Lack of clear connection between the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter and the preceding London narrative.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
The text is generally coherent in its core narrative about Will Bradley but suffers from noticeable structural disruptions due to unrelated scenes and abrupt transitions that fragment the logical flow and confuse the reader.
