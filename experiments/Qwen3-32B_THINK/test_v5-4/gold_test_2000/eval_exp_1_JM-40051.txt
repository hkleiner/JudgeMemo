Let me analyze this story and identify issues with coherence and fluency.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. It starts with the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden, then shifts to theological discussions, geographical descriptions, and back to personal observations.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure or progression. It begins with the author's decision to publish his findings, then discusses theological interpretations, then moves to geographical descriptions of the area, and then back to theological discussions.
- [CLARITY] Some arguments are presented but not clearly explained or supported. For example, the connection between the Mississippi River and the biblical Euphrates is made but not adequately justified.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between topics without smooth transitions. For example, the text moves from discussing the Garden of Eden to describing specific locations and then to rattlesnakes without clear connections.
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative is inconsistent in its focus - sometimes it's about the author's personal journey, sometimes about theological interpretations, and sometimes about geographical descriptions.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville" (missing article before Galesville), "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" (awkward phrasing), "and admirirg its most wonderful scenery" (misspelling of "admiring").
- [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, including "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," "euphony" instead of "euphony," "Bridtish" instead of "British," "jageed" instead of "jagged," etc.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structures are often awkward or ungrammatical. For example, "By degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent" is an awkward construction.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are inappropriate or unclear. For example, "The Mississippi—the bible Euphrates—river" is awkwardly phrased.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are numerous punctuation errors, including missing commas, incorrect use of dashes, and inconsistent punctuation throughout the text.

Based on these issues, I would rate:

Coherence: The text lacks a clear structure and logical progression. While it presents some interesting ideas, the narrative jumps between topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's argument. The text has some coherence but is significantly hindered by abrupt shifts and unclear connections.

Fluency: The text contains numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. Many sentences are difficult to parse due to poor syntax and punctuation. The language often feels unpolished and unprofessional.

My scores would be:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3 (Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.)
FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.)
