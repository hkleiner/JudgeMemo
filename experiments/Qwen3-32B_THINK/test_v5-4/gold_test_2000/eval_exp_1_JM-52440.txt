Alright, I'm going to analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria. Let me break this down systematically.

**1. Coherence Analysis:**
Coherence refers to how well the text is structured and how logically the ideas flow from one to another.

Issues with coherence:
- [STRUCTURE]: The text has a clear structure with an introduction and a chapter on the Real Presence, but it jumps between different levels of discussion without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC]: The argument sometimes lacks clear logical connections between premises and conclusions.
- [CLARITY]: Some concepts are presented in an abstract or complex manner that could be clearer.
- [COHERENCE]: The overall argument could be more tightly structured to better connect the different parts of the discussion.

**2. Fluency Analysis:**
Fluency refers to how smooth the language is and whether there are grammatical or syntactic issues.

Issues with fluency:
- [GRAMMAR]: There are some grammatical issues, particularly in sentence structure.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are overly complex or have awkward syntax.
- [LEXICON]: Some word choices are somewhat archaic or formal.
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of colons and semicolons.

Let me now provide specific feedback and scores:

**Issues with Coherence:**
- [STRUCTURE]: The text has a clear overall structure with an introduction and a chapter on the Real Presence, but the flow between different sections could be improved. The argument transitions between different points without always clearly signaling these shifts.
- [LOGIC]: The logical connections between ideas could be clearer. The text sometimes presents complex theological arguments without sufficient explanation of the logical relationships.
- [CLARITY]: Some of the language is quite dense and could be clearer. The text uses complex theological terminology without always defining it.
- [COHERENCE]: While the text is generally coherent, the argument could be more tightly structured to better connect the different parts of the discussion.

**Issues with Fluency:**
- [GRAMMAR]: There are some grammatical issues, such as the use of "There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." The em dashes and semicolon usage is awkward.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are overly complex, such as "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." The sentence structure is awkward and could be simplified.
- [LEXICON]: The text uses some archaic or formal language that might be less familiar to modern readers, such as "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" and "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him."
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and colons. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" has an unusual punctuation pattern.

**Final Scores:**

For Coherence:
The text has a clear structure and presents a logical argument about the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. However, the logical connections between ideas could be clearer, and the text could benefit from more explicit transitions between different points. The argument is generally coherent but could be more tightly structured. I would rate this as a 4 on the coherence scale.

For Fluency:
The text is generally well-written and readable, but there are some grammatical issues, complex sentence structures, and archaic language that could be improved. The language is formal and academic, which is appropriate for the content, but some of the sentence structures are awkward. I would rate this as a 4 on the fluency scale.

So, the final scores would be:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
