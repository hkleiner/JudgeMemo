Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to rate the story based on fluency and coherence, using the given criteria and scales. The user wants me to list specific issues in bullet points with labels, then assign scores from 1 to 5 for each metric.

First, I'll read through the story carefully to understand its structure and content. The story is about Will Bradley, a figure in American graphic arts, with two chapters: an introduction and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The introduction discusses his impact on American design, and the second chapter is a narrative of his early life.

Now, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me scan the text for any errors. 

In the first chapter, there's "It shoulded be talked about" which should be "It should be talked about." That's a past tense issue. Then "hard to realized" should be "hard to realize." "Barriers being demolish" should be "barriers being demolished." In the second chapter, "Most of the work is do by hand" should be "done." "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." That's a typo for "ink." "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'" – "was" should be "were." "You was on your way to Northern Michigan" – "was" should be "were." "You went to school for a few weeks. On circus day you are allowed..." – tense inconsistency. "You are now quite grown up, nearly ten. At a Sunday-school picnic..." – "are" should be "were." "You asked her to wait for you. She promises." – tense shift. "It will be made to lasted until..." – "lasted" should be "last." "You was on your way to Northern Michigan" – "was" should be "were." "You went to Fisherman’s Beach and watch the fishermen took lobsters..." – "watch" and "took" tense inconsistency. "When you was hungry..." – "was" should be "were." "There is often a cold cod-fish cake to was found..." – "was found" is incorrect. "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston..." – "was" should be "were." "It is your first day in the little mining town..." – "are standing" should be "stood." "You like her. You are now quite grown up..." – "are" should be "were." "You told the little girl you are someday went back..." – tense inconsistency. "You asked her to wait for you. She promises." – tense shift. "You could now give all of your attention..." – "was" should be "were." "In the fall you went to school and somehow manage to pulled through." – "manage" should be "managed." "Your uncle and aunt went for a visit 'back East.' Your mother kept house for your cousins." – tense inconsistency. "Every night when you go to bed..." – "go" should be "went." "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." – "anyway" is a bit odd here. "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." – maybe a comma issue. "You are put to worked washing-up a Gordon press." – "worked" should be "work." "There is power, a small engine mount on an upright boiler..." – "mount" should be "mounted." "The two jobbers are kicked." – unclear, maybe missing words. "Had half an hour of leisure you learned the lay..." – missing subject or verb. "You are now a worked man--wages three dollars a week." – "worked" should be "worker." "Country newspaper shops train and used local help..." – "used" should be "use." "For job work, ads and presswork they depend upon itinerant job printers..." – "depend upon itinerant job printers" is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward. "When the Iron Ore job printer leaves you are sorry." – missing article. "He has am a kind and patient teacher." – "has am" is incorrect. "You are now twelve. Mr. Newett employs a new devil and you set jobs..." – "devil" might be a term for an apprentice, but it's a bit confusing. "You are now thirteen and Mr. Newett offers you ten dollars a week..." – correct. "At fourteen this wage is increased to twelve." – "twelve" is vague, should be "twelve dollars." "At fifteen you are spoken of as foreman..." – correct. "This is the early Eighties. Small towns such as Ishpeming are 'easy pickings' for traveled fakers." – "traveled" should be "traveling." "Their advance was always heralded by the exchanges." – "advance" might be "arrival." "They clean up at the expense of local merchants." – "clean up" is correct. "All editors warn them to keep away." – "warn them to keep away" is correct. "Iron Ore print shop is on the ground floor." – "print shop" is correct. "His desk is at the big window." – correct. "It is nearly nine o’clock on a Friday night--'make-up' time." – correct. "Mr. Newett walks leisurely to where there was several guns..." – "was" should be "were." 

Now for coherence. The story is split into two chapters. The first is an introduction to Will Bradley, discussing his impact on American design. The second is a narrative of his early life. The transition between the two chapters is abrupt, with no clear connection. The introduction is written in a more analytical tone, while the second chapter is a narrative, which might be jarring for the reader. The second chapter is a detailed account of Bradley's childhood and early career, but it's written in the second person ("you"), which is unusual for a biography. This could confuse readers about the narrative perspective. The story jumps from the introduction to the childhood narrative without a smooth transition. The second chapter is a long, detailed narrative that might not be necessary for the introduction, leading to a lack of cohesion. The use of the second person in the second chapter might make it feel like a fictional narrative rather than a factual biography, which could affect coherence. The story's structure is somewhat disjointed between the two chapters, with the first being an overview and the second a detailed personal account. The second chapter's use of the second person could be seen as a stylistic choice, but it may not be consistent with the overall structure of the text. The lack of a clear transition between the two chapters and the shift in narrative style could affect the overall coherence.

So, for fluency, there are several grammatical errors, tense inconsistencies, and word choice issues. For coherence, the abrupt transition between chapters and the shift in narrative style (especially the use of second person in the second chapter) might affect the overall flow and clarity.
