Alright, I need to evaluate this story based on the given criteria for coherence and fluency. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, the story is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite dense and academic in nature, with a lot of references to church documents and doctrinal positions. The structure is clear with an introduction and subsequent chapters, but the content is very specific and might be challenging for some readers.

For fluency, I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. Let me scan through the text for any obvious errors. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "is teach by the Church of England" should be "is taught by the Church of England". Also, "and am the true expositors" should be "and are the true expositors". There are several instances of incorrect verb conjugations, like "was the real point at issue" instead of "is the real point at issue". 

Spelling errors include "bless Saviour" instead of "blessed Saviour". There's also "was not say to be changed" which should be "was not said to be changed". The phrase "was not say to be changed" is incorrect. 

The text uses some archaic or non-standard phrasing, like "there was no authoritative documents" instead of "there were no authoritative documents". Also, "it is not fair that the Church should was held responsible" should be "should be held responsible". 

In terms of coherence, the story is well-structured with an introduction and chapter on the Real Presence. The flow of ideas is logical, moving from general assertions to specific doctrines and then examining church documents. However, the dense content and academic nature might make it challenging for some readers to follow, especially if they're not familiar with the subject matter. 

The text jumps between discussing the Church of England's stance and contrasting it with Rome's doctrine, which is a good point of comparison but could be confusing if not clearly delineated. The author references various documents like the Articles and Catechism, which are relevant but might require additional context for clarity. 

There are some abrupt shifts in the narrative, such as moving from discussing the sacraments to the current state of the Church of England. The author also mentions the need to examine church documents but doesn't elaborate on each one in detail, which might leave some readers wanting more information. 

Overall, the story is coherent in its structure and logical progression, but the dense academic language and specific content might hinder full understanding for some readers. The fluency issues are present but not so severe that they prevent comprehension. The errors in grammar and syntax are noticeable but don't completely disrupt the flow.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "is teach" → "is taught," "am" → "are," "was" → "is").  
- [SPELLING] Misspellings (e.g., "bless" → "blessed," "was not say" → "was not said").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "there was no authoritative documents" → "there were no authoritative documents," "it is not fair that the Church should was held responsible" → "should be held responsible").  
- [LEXICON] Non-standard word usage (e.g., "localised" → "localized," "connected" → "connected").  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between doctrinal explanations and broader theological context (e.g., moving abruptly from sacrament definitions to the Church’s current state).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in complex theological arguments (e.g., "the sign woulded cease" → "the sign would cease").  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
