Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on fluency and coherence, pointing out issues in bullet points with labels and then assigning scores from 1 to 5 for each metric. 

First, I'll read through the entire story to get a sense of its structure and content. The story is split into two chapters: "An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The first chapter seems to be an introduction written by someone else about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts. The second chapter is a narrative about Bradley's early life and career.

Now, let's tackle fluency. Fluency is about how the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. I'll look for any obvious errors or awkward phrasing.

In the first chapter, I notice some awkward phrases. For example, "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." This seems like a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order and possible typos. Also, "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." This part is confusing and doesn't make sense. There are other instances like "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The phrase "stir in its sleep" is a bit awkward but might be intentional. 

In the second chapter, there's a sentence that says: "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." The transition between these sentences is abrupt. Also, "bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar “version old pretends.” He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings." This part is very confusing and hard to parse. It seems like a typo or grammatical error. 

Looking at coherence, which is about the overall structure and logical flow. The first chapter transitions from the introduction to historical context, then to Bradley's work and impact. The second chapter is a narrative about his early life. The two chapters are distinct but connected by the subject. 

However, in the second chapter, the narrative jumps between different events in Bradley's life without clear transitions. For example, moving from his childhood to working in the newspaper office without smooth connections. There are also some unclear references, like "Your for house your mother keeps cousins." This seems like a misplaced or incomplete sentence. 

Another issue is the lack of clear time markers. For instance, "In the fall you go to school..." then suddenly "It is your second year in school..." without a clear transition. Also, some sentences are fragmented or run-on, making the flow choppy.

For fluency issues, I'll list each problem with the appropriate label. For coherence, I'll note where the structure or transitions are lacking. 

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, there are multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but some parts are fluent. So maybe a 3. For coherence, the story has a general flow but some abrupt shifts and unclear parts, so a 3 as well.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." – incoherent sentence structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." – nonsensical phrasing and word order.  
- [GRAMMAR] "bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar “version old pretends.”" – fragmented and ungrammatical.  
- [CLARITY] Abrupt shifts between unrelated events in the second chapter (e.g., sudden jump from childhood to newspaper work without context).  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs in the second chapter, making the narrative disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear references (e.g., "Your for house your mother keeps cousins") disrupt the flow.  
- [SPELLING] "anywayarithmetic n’t like, do" – misspelled and malformed sentence.  
- [SYNTAX] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case..." – awkward phrasing and lack of subject-verb agreement.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
