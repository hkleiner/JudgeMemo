Okay, I need to evaluate the given story for both coherence and fluency. Let's start with fluency. The story is a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, so I should check for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, or awkward phrasing.

Looking at the first paragraph, there's a typo: "seej by several living members" should be "seen by". Then "as wdll as bu tye rector" is clearly a typo for "as well as by the rector". Next, "ofteb got very little sleep" should be "often got". In the next paragraph, "A fsw weeks afger this" is "a few weeks after this". "Now and then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice" – "brooding" might be a strange word here, maybe "mewing" or "cooing" would be better, but it's a stylistic choice. "before tuey reavhed the house" should be "before they reached". 

In the second chapter, "Yhe storm" is "The storm". "evwrything" is "everything". "librwry had been locked" is "library had been locked". "up-staies" should be "upstairs". "Myerw and Podmore" is "Myers and Podmore". "rhe sound of footsteps" – "rhe" is a typo for "the". "obpong phial" should be "opaque phial". "Unoted States" is "United States". 

Now for coherence. The story is about an American family moving into a haunted house. The flow seems logical: introduction of characters, arrival at the house, the bloodstain issue, and the ghost's appearance. However, there are a few points where the narrative could be clearer. For example, the transition from the first chapter to the second is abrupt. The second chapter starts with the storm and the reappearance of the stain, but the connection to the previous chapter's events is a bit sudden. Also, the detailed description of the family and the house might be a bit lengthy, but it's part of setting up the characters. The dialogue between Mr. Otis and the ghost is consistent and contributes to the humor of the story. The overall structure is clear, but the typos and errors in the text might disrupt the flow a bit, affecting both fluency and coherence. 

For fluency score: There are several typos and spelling errors that are noticeable but don't severely hinder understanding. The text is mostly fluent, so maybe a 3 or 4. Considering the number of errors, a 3 seems appropriate because some errors are quite obvious and affect the flow. 

For coherence: The story is generally coherent, but the abrupt transition between chapters and some unclear parts (like the sudden reappearance of the stain) might cause minor issues. However, the narrative is mostly well-structured. A 4 seems right because the main ideas are clear, but there are some minor disconnects.
