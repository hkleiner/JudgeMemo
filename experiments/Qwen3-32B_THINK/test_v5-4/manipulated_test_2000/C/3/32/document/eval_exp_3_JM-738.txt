Let me analyze this story and evaluate it according to the given criteria of coherence and fluency.

First, I'll check for coherence issues:
- The story is about Dickens's last novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and various theories about its unresolved ending.
- It discusses the structure and characters of the novel.
- There are some logical connections and progression in the narrative.
- However, there are some coherence problems:

[LOGIC] The story jumps between discussing Dickens's writing style, the plot of "Edwin Drood," and theories about its ending without clear transitions.
[CLARITY] There are many references to "a stuff" and "the stuff" without clear explanation of what they refer to.
[STRUCTURE] The narrative is somewhat disjointed, moving between analysis of Dickens's work, character descriptions, and theories about the ending.
[LOGIC] Some connections between ideas are not well established, making the overall flow of the text less coherent.

Now for fluency issues:
- The text contains many archaic or unusual word choices and sentence structures.
- There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings.

[SYNTAX] The text contains complex, run-on sentences that are difficult to follow.
[LEXICON] There are some unusual or archaic word choices that might be confusing to modern readers.
[GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and inconsistent verb tenses.
[SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and sometimes awkward.
[LEXICON] Some words are repeated unnecessarily.
[GRAMMAR] There are some missing prepositions and articles.

Based on these observations:

For Coherence:
The text has some logical connections and structure, but there are significant issues with clarity, transitions, and overall coherence. The references to "a stuff" and "the stuff" without explanation make the text confusing. The narrative jumps between topics without clear connections.

For Fluency:
The text has many issues with grammar, syntax, and word choice. The sentence structures are often complex and difficult to follow. There are some grammatical errors that affect readability.

On the given scale:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3 (Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text)
FINAL Fluency Score: 3 (Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text)
