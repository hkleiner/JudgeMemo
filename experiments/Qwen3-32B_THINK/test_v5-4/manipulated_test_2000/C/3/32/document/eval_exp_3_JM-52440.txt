Alright, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria thoroughly.

Starting with Fluency. The story is quite long and dense, filled with religious terminology and complex sentences. I'll need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. For example, the text uses phrases like "the stuff" which seems out of place. That's a problem because "stuff" is vague and unclear. There are also instances of missing articles or prepositions, like "the documents of the stuff" – "the stuff" here is confusing. Additionally, some sentences are run-on or awkwardly structured, making them hard to follow. These issues would lower the fluency score.

Now for Coherence. The story's structure is somewhat logical, moving from introduction to chapters discussing the doctrine. However, the repetition of phrases like "the thing" and "the stuff" without clear definitions disrupts the flow. The argument presented is dense, and the lack of clear transitions between paragraphs makes it hard to follow the progression of ideas. Some sections jump abruptly from one concept to another, which affects coherence. The main idea is about the Church of England's doctrine, but the unclear references and jargon might confuse readers, especially those unfamiliar with the topic.

Looking at the specific issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors like missing articles and incorrect prepositions. 
- [LEXICON] The use of "stuff" instead of specific terms is problematic. 
- [LOGIC] The argument sometimes lacks logical flow between points. 
- [CLARITY] The text is unclear in parts due to vague terms and complex sentences. 
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections are abrupt, making the narrative disjointed.

For Fluency, the presence of multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing would likely result in a score of 3. While the text is mostly understandable, the errors hinder smooth reading. For Coherence, the structure is somewhat logical but marred by unclear references and abrupt transitions, leading to a score of 3 as well. The story is coherent in general but has significant issues that affect the overall flow and clarity.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Repeated use of "the stuff" instead of specific terms (e.g., "the Church," "the sacrament") creates confusion.  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrases like "the thing" and "a thing, and the thing" lack clarity and disrupt understanding.  
- [LOGIC] The argument sometimes jumps between ideas without clear connections (e.g., shifting abruptly from Scripture to the Church of England's Articles).  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of jargon ("real objective presence," "accidents of bread and wine") without explanation may alienate readers unfamiliar with theological terms.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt, lacking smooth progression (e.g., moving from Scripture to Roman doctrine without bridging ideas).  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors ("communion" vs. "communion") and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Lord’s Supper" vs. "Lord’s supper") are present.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
