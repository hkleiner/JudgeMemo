Let me analyze this story to provide a rating according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll examine the text for issues related to coherence and fluency:

For Coherence:
1. The story is about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist, and his early life and career.
2. The narrative is structured as an introduction followed by a chapter about his childhood.
3. There are some instances where the text refers to "a thing" and "a stuff" without clarification.
4. The story jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions.
5. There are some inconsistencies in the narrative flow, particularly in the second chapter about his childhood.

2. The text contains numerous spelling errors.
3. There are missing punctuation marks and awkward phrasing.
