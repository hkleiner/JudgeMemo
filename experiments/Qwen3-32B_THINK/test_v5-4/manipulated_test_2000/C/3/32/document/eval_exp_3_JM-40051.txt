Let me analyze the story to identify issues with fluency and coherence.

First, I'll look at fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, punctuation):

[GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, such as missing articles (e.g., "in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT"), incorrect verb forms, and sentence fragments.
[GRAMMAR] - The text frequently uses first person "I" without proper subject-verb agreement.
[GRAMMAR] - There are instances of incorrect prepositions and word order.
[SPELLING] - There are many misspelled words, such as "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "Havilah" (should be "Havilah" but appears to be used incorrectly), "consitutes" (should be "constitutes"), "jageed" (should be "jagged").
[SYNTAX] - The text has awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences that are difficult to follow.
[LEXICON] - The text uses repetitive and awkward word choices, often using the same words in different contexts without clear meaning.
[SYNTAX] - The text has poor punctuation, including missing commas, periods, and quotation marks.
[LOGIC] - There are logical inconsistencies in the text, particularly with the repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" without clear reference.

Now, for coherence issues (logical sequence, smooth connections, clear progression, avoiding ambiguities):

[LOGIC] - The narrative is disjointed and lacks a clear logical progression. The author jumps between ideas without proper transitions.
[STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear structure or organization. It reads more like a collection of random thoughts rather than a coherent narrative.
[CLARITY] - The text is often unclear and ambiguous, with statements that don't clearly connect to the overall narrative.
[TRANSITION] - There are no smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas.
[LOGIC] - The text presents a series of claims without proper evidence or logical support.
[LOGIC] - The narrative is repetitive, with the same ideas being stated multiple times in different ways.
[LOGIC] - The text contains many contradictions, particularly in the claims about the location of the Garden of Eden.

Now, I'll determine the scores based on the evaluation criteria:

FLUENCY SCORE:
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward syntax, and poor punctuation. These issues significantly impact the readability and flow of the text. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is severely compromised.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Entirely fluent, grammatically correct, and well written.
- Score 4: Only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect.
- Score 3: Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text.
- Score 2: There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.
- Score 1: Not fluent at all, full of meaningless fragments and unclear contents.

Given the numerous and significant fluency issues, I would rate this as a 2.

COHERENCE SCORE:
The text lacks a clear logical progression, has poor organization, and contains many disjointed ideas. The narrative is repetitive and often contradictory. While the author attempts to present a claim about the location of the Garden of Eden, the text fails to build a coherent argument.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Entirely coherent, well-structured and well-organized, building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information among all the sentences.
- Score 4: Only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence.
- Score 3: Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.
- Score 2: There are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.
- Score 1: Not coherent at all, many logical gaps, no progression, and many sections that feel disjointed or out of sync with the rest.

Given the significant coherence issues, I would rate this as a 2.

Let me now formalize my answer in the requested format:

Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] - Numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and sentence fragments.

[SPELLING] - Many misspelled words such as "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "Havilah," "consitutes," and "jageed."
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences that are difficult to follow.
[LEXICON] - Repetitive and awkward word choices with unclear meaning.
[SYNTAX] - Poor punctuation, including missing commas, periods, and quotation marks.
[LOGIC] - Repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" without clear reference.
[LOGIC] - Disjointed narrative with no clear logical progression.
[STRUCTURE] - Lacks a clear structure or organization, reading more like a collection of random thoughts.

[LOGIC] - Presents a series of claims without proper evidence or logical support.
[LOGIC] - Repetitive, with the same ideas stated multiple times in different ways.
