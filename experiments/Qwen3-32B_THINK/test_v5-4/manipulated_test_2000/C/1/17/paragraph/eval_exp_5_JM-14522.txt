Alright, let me analyze this story to evaluate its coherence and fluency. I'll start by reading through the text carefully.

The story appears to be a mix of two different narratives. The first part is about the Canterville Ghost and the Otis family, which is a classic ghost story. However, it is interspersed with a completely different narrative about a character named Stransom encountering Paul Creston in a jeweler's shop and another about a character named Mary Antrim. These sections seem unrelated to the main ghost story.

Now I'll evaluate the coherence and fluency:

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure. It jumps between completely different narratives without any clear connection or transition. The Canterville Ghost story is interrupted by unrelated scenes about Stransom and Mary Antrim.
2. [LOGIC] The logical connections between the different parts of the story are weak or non-existent. The Canterville Ghost narrative is a classic ghost story, while the Stransom/Mary Antrim narrative appears to be a different genre entirely.
3. [UNRESOLVED] The different narratives aren't resolved or connected in any way. The story ends with the ghost being scared by children with a pillow, but the other narratives about Stransom and Mary Antrim are left completely unresolved.
4. [AMBIGUITY] The story is confusing in its overall structure. It's unclear what the relationship is between the different narratives, if any.
5. [INCONSISTENCY] The tone and style shift dramatically between the different parts of the story. The Canterville Ghost narrative is written in a classic, formal style, while the Stransom/Mary Antrim narrative has a different tone and style.

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [LEXICON] There are some vocabulary issues, particularly in the Stransom/Mary Antrim section where some words may be used incorrectly or out of context.
2. [SYNTAX] The syntax is generally good, but there are some awkward phrasings in both narratives.
3. [SPELLING] I don't notice any spelling errors in the text.
4. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is generally correct, though there are a few places where commas and periods could be more effectively used.
5. [WORD CHOICE] There are a few instances where the word choice seems slightly off or awkward in both narratives.
6. [PACING] The pacing of the story is inconsistent, particularly with the abrupt shifts between completely different narratives.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the coherence and fluency:

For Coherence (how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas):
- The story has multiple disconnected narratives with no clear connection or transition between them.
- The different parts of the story are not resolved or connected.
- The structure is confusing and the overall narrative lacks coherence.

For Fluency (how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):
- The text has some vocabulary and word choice issues.
- There are some awkward phrasings in both narratives.
- The syntax is generally good but not consistently so.
- The punctuation is mostly correct.

I need to assign scores according to the given scale:

COHERENCE SCORE:
- The story has major issues with coherence, with multiple disconnected narratives and no clear structure or logical progression.
- This would place it in the range of a Score 2, as the text has many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.

FLUENCY SCORE:
- The text has some fluency issues with vocabulary, word choice, and awkward phrasing, but is generally understandable.
- This would place it in the range of a Score 3, as it's fluent in general with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text.

I need to finalize these scores and list the specific issues.

Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure and jumps between completely different narratives without transitions.
[LOGIC] The logical connections between the different parts of the story are weak or non-existent.
[UNRESOLVED] The different narratives aren't resolved or connected in any way.
[AMBIGUITY] The story is confusing in its overall structure.
[INCONSISTENCY] The tone and style shift dramatically between the different parts of the story.
[LEXICON] There are some vocabulary issues in the Stransom/Mary Antrim section.
[SYNTAX] There are some awkward phrasings in both narratives.
[WORD CHOICE] There are a few instances where the word choice seems slightly off or awkward in both narratives.
[PACING] The pacing of the story is inconsistent with abrupt shifts between completely different narratives.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
