Alright, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate it based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, there are some obvious issues. For example, in the first paragraph, "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject. Then there's "the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" which is capitalized oddly. There's a typo in "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians". Also, "dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions". The phrase "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" uses "plat" which might be a typo for "plot" or "plateau". 

Looking further, there's "admirirg" instead of "admiring". The sentence structure in "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." is a run-on. The paragraph about Jasper and Rosa seems out of place compared to the rest of the text, which is about finding Eden. Then there's a sudden shift to "Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman..." which is a different story entirely, possibly from a different author. This abrupt transition disrupts the flow. 

In the section about the Life Assurance Office, the sentence structure is confusing: "It is no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I might derive my first impression of strangers..." This is a long, complex sentence that's hard to follow. There's also a mention of "the serpents have been destroyed" which is unclear in context. 

Moving to coherence. The story starts with the discovery of Eden but then jumps to a completely different narrative about Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin. This is a major coherence issue because it's a different plot and characters. Later, there's a paragraph about Mrs. Umney and Canterville Chase, which seems like a third unrelated story. These abrupt shifts make the narrative disjointed and hard to follow. The overall structure lacks a clear progression. The author's attempt to connect the Mississippi River to the Garden of Eden is present but the inclusion of unrelated stories breaks the coherence. 

The story also has some logical inconsistencies. For example, the author claims to have found Eden in America but then includes European-sounding names and locations without explanation. The mix of different narratives and the lack of transitions between them make the text confusing. The final paragraphs about the Life Assurance Office and George Stransom don't connect to the main theme at all, further reducing coherence. 

For fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which would lower the score. For coherence, the multiple unrelated stories and abrupt shifts make it hard to follow, leading to a lower score as well. 

Putting it all together: Fluency has several issues with grammar and structure, so maybe a 2. Coherence is significantly affected by the disjointed narratives, so perhaps a 2 as well.
