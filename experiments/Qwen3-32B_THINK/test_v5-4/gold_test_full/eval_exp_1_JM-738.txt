I need to evaluate the given story text based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let me analyze the text carefully.

First, I'll go through the text to identify any issues with coherence and fluency.

For coherence, I need to look at:
- Logical sequencing of ideas
- Non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas
- Clear progression from one section to another
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps
- Consistent and clear narrative structure

For fluency, I need to look at:
- Syntax, grammar, spelling
- Word choice and phrasing
- Punctuation
- Smooth flow of the text

Now, let me analyze the text for issues:

1. Coherence Issues:
- The text is a detailed analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and theories about its unresolved ending.
- The structure is logical and follows a clear progression, moving from introduction to analysis of characters and plot to evaluation of different theories.
- The ideas are well connected and there are no major ambiguities or abrupt jumps in the narrative.
- There are some minor instances of repetition in discussing different theories.

2. Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are a few grammatical issues, such as missing articles or prepositions.
- [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is generally correct, but there are some instances of run-on sentences or missing commas.
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is mostly clear, but there are some complex sentences that could be simplified for better readability.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for the academic tone of the text.
- [STYLE] The writing style is consistent and appropriate for the subject matter.
- [SPELLING] I don't see any obvious spelling errors.

Let me identify specific issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "He was to have a lesson" - The tense is a bit confusing here. It should be "He was to have a lesson" or "He was supposed to have a lesson."
2. [PUNCTUATION] "He was very young, and speaks of Rosa with bad taste, but he is really in love with her, much more so than she with him, and he is piqued by her ceaseless mockery, and by their false position." - This is a run-on sentence that would benefit from a period or semicolon.
3. [SYNTAX] "The question is—when? More probably _not_ on the Christmas Eve just imminent, when Edwin is to vanish, but, on the Christmas Eve following, when Jasper is to be unmasked." - The sentence structure is a bit convoluted and could be clearer.
4. [SYNTAX] "It is absolutely new to Edwin Drood that the hag was hunting Jasper. Next day Datchery sees the woman shake her fists at Jasper in church, and hears from her that she knows Jasper 'better far than all the reverend parsons put together know him.'" - This could be clearer with a bit of restructuring.
5. [PUNCTUATION] "He gives her the money; she asks his Christian name. 'Edwin.' Is 'Eddy' a sweetheart’s form of that?" - The semicolon could be a period for better readability.
6. [STYLE] The text has a somewhat archaic or formal style that is consistent throughout, which is appropriate for the subject but may be challenging for some readers.

Overall, the text is well-structured and coherent, with only minor issues in grammar and punctuation that don't significantly impact understanding. The language is generally fluent and appropriate for the subject matter.

For the Coherence score, I would say it's a 5 (entirely coherent, well-structured and well-organized). The text builds logically from sentence to sentence and the narrative is clear and consistent.

For the Fluency score, I would say it's a 4 (only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect). The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

So my final evaluation would be:
Issues: [GRAMMAR] "He was to have a lesson" - The tense is a bit confusing here. [PUNCTUATION] Some run-on sentences and missing commas. [SYNTAX] A few complex sentences could be simplified for better readability. [STYLE] The text has a somewhat archaic or formal style that may be challenging for some readers.
FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
