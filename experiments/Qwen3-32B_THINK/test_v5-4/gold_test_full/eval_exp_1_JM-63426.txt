I'll analyze the provided story according to the evaluation criteria for coherence and fluency.

First, let me understand what the story is about. This appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American typographer and designer. The story is written in a unique style, blending narrative with historical commentary, and is presented in a series of chapters that chronologically document Bradley's life and career.

Now, I'll evaluate the text for issues related to fluency and coherence:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues throughout the text. For example: "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." The sentence structure is somewhat awkward and could be clearer.

2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have complex structures that are difficult to follow. For example: "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." The use of em dashes and the placement of the comment about religion is a bit jarring.

3. [SPELLING] I don't see any obvious spelling errors in the text.

4. [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the subject matter, though there are some archaic or specialized terms that might be confusing to readers unfamiliar with printing and typography (e.g., "pi", "Gordon press", "flywheel", "halftones").

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured as a biography, with clear chronological progression from chapter to chapter. However, the transition between the introduction chapter and the first chapter about Bradley's early life is somewhat abrupt.

2. [LOGIC] The narrative is generally logical and follows a clear timeline of Bradley's life and career. However, there are some places where the connections between ideas could be clearer.

3. [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and chapters could be smoother. For example, the shift from the introduction to the chapter about Bradley's early life in Ishpeming is somewhat jarring.

4. [CLARITY] The text is generally clear, though some of the historical and technical details about printing and typography might be challenging for readers without prior knowledge of the field.

Based on my analysis, here are my scores:

For fluency, I would give a 3. The text is generally readable and well-written, but there are some grammatical issues, awkward sentence structures, and complex vocabulary that could make it difficult for some readers to follow smoothly.

For coherence, I would give a 4. The narrative is well-structured and follows a clear chronological progression through Bradley's life. The story is logically organized and the connections between ideas are generally clear, though some transitions could be smoother.

Let me review the text again to make sure I'm not missing any issues:

I notice that the text is written in a somewhat unusual style, with some first-person sections and some second-person sections. This might be intentional to create a particular effect, but it could also be seen as a coherence issue if it's confusing to readers.

Also, there are some inconsistencies in tense throughout the text. Some parts are written in past tense, while others are in present tense. This could potentially affect both fluency and coherence.

Overall, I believe my assessment of 4 for coherence and 3 for fluency is appropriate based on the text.
