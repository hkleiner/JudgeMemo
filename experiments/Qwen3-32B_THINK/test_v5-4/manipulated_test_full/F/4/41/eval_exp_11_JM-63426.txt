I'll analyze the story based on the evaluation criteria provided for Coherence and Fluency.

First, let me identify issues related to Coherence (how the story unfolds as a whole):

1. [STRUCTURE] The story is presented in a non-linear fashion with multiple chapters that jump back and forth in time without clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] There are logical gaps between sections that make it difficult to follow the chronological progression of Will Bradley's life.
3. [CLARITY] The narrative is sometimes confusing due to the shifting perspectives between first-person and second-person narration.
4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between different time periods and locations are abrupt and lack smooth connections.
5. [PERSPECTIVE] The story shifts between an introduction written by someone else and the main narrative written in the first-person voice of Will Bradley, which can be disorienting for the reader.

Now, let me identify issues related to Fluency (how the text reads from start to finish):

1. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text.
2. [SPELLING] There are many spelling mistakes, including misspelled words and incorrect letter substitutions.
3. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward and difficult to parse.
4. [LEXICON] There are several instances of incorrect or inconsistent word usage.
5. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often incorrect or missing, making the text harder to read.
6. [TYPOS] There are numerous typographical errors throughout the text.
7. [INCONSISTENT STYLE] The text has inconsistent capitalization and formatting of names and places.
8. [INCONSISTENT TENSES] The narrative jumps between different verb tenses without clear indication.

Examples of specific issues:
- "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK. I agreed to write an introduction..." - The story begins in all caps and then shifts to standard capitalization.
- "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleel" - "sleel" appears to be a typo for "sleep."
- "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." - This sentence is long and complex, making it difficult to follow.
- "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body" - "slight body" is likely a typo for "slight build."
- "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." - This sentence is grammatically correct but metaphorically complex.
- "You are six years old; next month you will be seven." - The use of semicolon here is questionable.
- "The employees are apl natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." - "apl natives" is likely a typo for "all natives."
- "Your mother goes out every day to do dress-making." - This is a simple sentence with no obvious issues.
- "You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and return with a supply of unfinished." - This sentence is grammatically correct but could be more concise.
- "For each trip you are paid five cents. With your savings you buy a printing press." - This is a simple, clear sentence.

Based on my analysis, I'll now provide the final scores:

For Coherence:
The story has significant issues with structure, logic, clarity, and transitions. The narrative jumps back and forth in time without clear connections, and the shifting perspectives between the introduction and the main narrative can be disorienting. While the story does tell a coherent narrative about Will Bradley's life, the structure and presentation make it difficult to follow.

For Fluency:
The text has numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors. The sentence structure is often awkward, and there are many typographical errors. The text would require significant editing to make it fluent and easy to read.

My final scores:
Coherence Score: 3 (Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text)
Fluency Score: 2 (There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments)
