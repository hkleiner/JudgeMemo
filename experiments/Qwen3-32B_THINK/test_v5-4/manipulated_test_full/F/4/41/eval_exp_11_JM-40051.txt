Alright, I need to evaluate the story provided based on the given criteria: Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means according to the instructions.

Coherence refers to how well the story is structured and how logically the ideas progress. It should be clear, with smooth transitions between ideas and no abrupt shifts or logical gaps. Fluency is about how the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

Looking at the story, it's a long, descriptive piece about the discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. Let me go through it and identify any issues.

First, for Coherence:
- The story starts with the author's claim and then dives into a detailed description of the location. However, the narrative is quite disjointed. There are many digressions and tangents, such as historical claims, comparisons with other theories, and extensive descriptions of geographical features without a clear structure.
- The author frequently shifts between describing the landscape, making theological arguments, and responding to critics. These shifts are not well-connected, making the overall narrative feel scattered.
- There are also some logical inconsistencies. For example, the author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's location based on specific geographical features, but the reasoning is not always clear or logically sequenced.
- The story lacks a clear progression. It moves from one geographical feature to another without a clear order, making it difficult to follow the overall argument.

Now for Fluency:
- There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "thr earth" instead of "the earth", "tje antldiluvians" instead of "the antediluvians", "giverca description" instead of "give a description", and so on.
- There are also grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb forms, and incorrect prepositions.
- The syntax is often awkward, with run-on sentences and incomplete thoughts. For example, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject after the comma.
- The punctuation is also problematic, with missing commas and periods, and incorrect use of em dashes and other punctuation marks.
- There are instances of repetition and redundancy, such as repeated references to the Mississippi River and the hanging garden without variation in phrasing.

Let me list specific issues for each category:

For Coherence:
- [STRUCTURE]: The story lacks a clear organizational structure. It moves from one geographical feature to another without a logical sequence, making it difficult to follow the overall argument.
- [LOGIC]: Some arguments are presented without sufficient supporting evidence or logical connections. For example, the author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's location based on specific geographical features, but the reasoning is not always clear.
- [CLARITY]: The text is often unclear due to the author's tendency to make sweeping generalizations and assumptions without providing clear explanations.
- [TRANSITION]: There are abrupt transitions between different topics and ideas, such as from describing the landscape to responding to critics, without proper transitions or connections.

For Fluency:
- [SPELLING]: There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "thr earth", "tje antldiluvians", "giverca description", "thd south-west", etc.
- [GRAMMAR]: There are grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb forms, and incorrect prepositions.
- [SYNTAX]: The syntax is often awkward, with run-on sentences and incomplete thoughts.
- [PUNCTUATION]: The punctuation is problematic, with missing commas and periods, and incorrect use of em dashes and other punctuation marks.
- [LEXICON]: There are instances of word choice that is either incorrect or awkward, such as "x large city" instead of "a large city" or "xnything" instead of "anything".

Now, I need to assign scores based on the accuracy scale provided.

For Coherence:
- The story has some coherence in that it is about the author's claim about the Garden of Eden's location and provides some descriptions. However, the narrative is largely disjointed with many digressions, logical inconsistencies, and a lack of clear structure. The author frequently shifts between different topics without clear transitions.
- Based on the accuracy scale, this would be a score of 2. The story has some coherence but contains many disconnected parts and inconsistencies that make the overall context difficult to understand without effort.

For Fluency:
- The text has significant issues with spelling, grammar, syntax, and punctuation. There are numerous errors that hinder the flow of the text and make it difficult to read.
- Based on the accuracy scale, this would be a score of 2. The text has major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

Let me review my assessment one more time to ensure accuracy:
- Coherence: The story is largely incoherent due to its disjointed structure, logical inconsistencies, and lack of clear transitions between ideas. The author's arguments are often unclear and unsupported.
- Fluency: The text has numerous spelling, grammar, and syntax errors that significantly hinder readability. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is poor.

I believe my assessment is accurate based on the evaluation criteria provided.
