Okay, I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let's start by understanding the definitions provided.

Coherence refers to how well the story is structured and how ideas flow logically from one to another. It checks for logical sequencing, clarity, and consistency in the narrative. A high coherence score means the story is well-organized and ideas are connected smoothly without abrupt shifts or logical gaps.

Fluency assesses the smoothness of the text in terms of grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. A high fluency score means the text is free of errors and reads smoothly without awkward phrasing.

Now, let's look at the story. It's a theological discussion about the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The structure is clear with chapters and sections, and the author is methodically examining various documents like the Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, and Homilies to argue their point.

For Coherence:
- The story is divided into chapters and sections, which helps in organizing the content.
- The argument flows logically, moving from the introduction to the examination of each document.
- There are clear transitions between sections, and each part builds upon the previous one to support the central thesis.
- However, the story is quite dense and complex, which might make it challenging for some readers, but the logical structure is intact.

For Fluency:
- There are several spelling and grammatical errors. For example, "Taughtvby" should be "Taught by", "ans place" should be "and place", "vlindly" is incorrect, "experiejced" should be "experienced", "het" is incorrect, "Docteine" should be "Doctrine", "iur" should be "our", "whsther" should be "whether", "yhat" should be "that", "thr" should be "the", "Englahd" should be "England", "eneeavouring" should be "endeavouring", "csome" should be "some", "stare" should be "state", "Gox" should be "God", "pleqse" should be "please", "bodonnexionnwith" should be "by connexion with", "bug" should be "but", "Xhrist" should be "Christ", "nChrist" should be "Christ", "yhe" should be "the", "Communkon" should be "Communion", "beir" should be "be", "heartt" should be "heart", "undrr" should be "under", "qustions" should be "questions", "gajn" should be "gain", "ifbthe" should be "if the", "yhat" should be "that", "inwaed" should be "inward", "cthe" should be "the", "questioh" should be "question", "m‘Verily" should be "‘Verily", "vus" should be "us", "m‘Verily" should be "‘Verily", "thr" should be "the", "souo" should be "soul", "b‘What" should be "‘What", "pase" should be "passage", "itnwould" should be "it would", "pasdages" should be "passages", "vrrsion" should be "version", "langyage" should be "language", "Prater" should be "Prayer", "vrs" should be "vers", "yhe" should be "the", "tne" should be "the", "perdect" should be "perfect", "nativity, passion, resurrdction" should be "nativity, passion, resurrection", "b‘What" should be "‘What", "c‘Hereafter" should be "‘Hereafter", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘It" should be "‘It", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘It" should be "‘It", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘It" should be "‘It", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "b‘The" should be "‘The", "
