I'll analyze the story according to the evaluation criteria provided and rate it on coherence and fluency.

First, let me examine the text for fluency issues (syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):

Fluency Issues:
[GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text. For example:
- "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy."
- "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing."
- "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that."

[SYNTAX] There are numerous syntactically confusing sentences. The text often has long, run-on sentences with unclear structure.

[LEXICON] Some word choices appear incorrect or out of context. For example, the phrase "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the" doesn't form a coherent meaning.

Now let me examine the text for coherence issues (logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections, clear progression, and consistency):

Coherence Issues:
[LOGIC] There are logical gaps and abrupt shifts in the narrative. The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions.

[STRUCTURE] The overall structure is somewhat disjointed. The narrative appears to be a collection of anecdotes and historical information without a clear through-line or progression.

[CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or ambiguous. For example, the sentence about Will Bradley's impact on his time is difficult to follow.

[TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are often abrupt. The text jumps from one topic to another without clear connections.

Based on my analysis:

For Fluency:
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, syntactically confusing sentences, and unclear word choices. These issues significantly hinder the readability of the text. While there are some fluent passages, the numerous errors would make the text difficult for most readers to follow.

For Coherence:
The text has a general narrative about Will Bradley, but the structure is disjointed with logical gaps and unclear transitions. While there is an overall subject matter, the narrative often jumps between different topics and time periods without clear connections. The text appears to be a collection of anecdotes rather than a cohesive narrative.

Now I'll assign scores based on the provided accuracy scales:

FLUENCY SCORE:
The text has numerous grammatical errors and syntactically confusing sentences that significantly hinder readability. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is poor. Based on the scale, this would be a Score 2.

COHERENCE SCORE:
The text has a general narrative about Will Bradley but lacks a clear structure and logical flow. There are many disjointed sections and abrupt transitions. While the overall subject matter is somewhat clear, the narrative lacks the consistency and clear progression of a well-structured story. Based on the scale, this would be a Score 3.

Let me summarize my findings in the requested format:

[GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors throughout the text, including incorrect subject-verb agreement, improper sentence structure, and missing words.
[SYNTAX] Numerous syntactically confusing sentences with unclear structure and run-on constructions.

[LOGIC] Logical gaps and abrupt shifts in the narrative, with the text jumping between different time periods and topics without clear connections.
[STRUCTURE] Disjointed overall structure, with the narrative appearing as a collection of anecdotes rather than a cohesive story.
[CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or ambiguous, making the text difficult to follow.
[TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between sections, with the text jumping from one topic to another without clear connections.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
