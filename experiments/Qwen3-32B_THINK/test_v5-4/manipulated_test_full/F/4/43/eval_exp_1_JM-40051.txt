I need to evaluate this text according to the given criteria for coherence and fluency.

First, let me analyze the text for fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, punctuation):

Fluency issues:
[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "In no continent flood to it any that which..." is incoherent and grammatically incorrect. "Since of commenced idea not have my..." is also grammatically incorrect.
[SYNTAX] The syntax is often jumbled and confusing. The text frequently uses run-on sentences or fragments that don't form complete thoughts.
[SPELLING] There are spelling errors such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "beatiful" instead of "beautiful", "jageed" instead of "jagged", "Healdâ€™s quarry" with inconsistent punctuation, etc.
[LEXICON] There are instances of word choice errors or misuse of words.
[PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often incorrect or missing, contributing to the overall confusion.

Now for coherence issues (logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities, consistent structure):

Coherence issues:
[LOGIC] The text has logical inconsistencies and jumps in reasoning. The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden being in a specific location without clear logical connections between these claims and the evidence.
[STRUCTURE] The structure is disorganized. The text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end. It jumps between different topics without clear transitions.
[CLARITY] Much of the text is unclear or ambiguous. The author often makes grandiose claims without providing clear explanations or evidence.
[TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas. The text often begins new topics abruptly without connecting to the previous content.
[REPETITION] The text contains repetitive statements and circular reasoning.

Looking at the entire text, I can see that it's a rather incoherent and poorly written argument about the location of the Garden of Eden. The author frequently jumps between different points without clear connections, makes grandiose claims without evidence, and has numerous grammatical and syntactical errors throughout.

For the fluency score:
The text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and syntax issues that make it difficult to read. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is significantly impacted by these errors. I would rate this as a 2 on the fluency scale.

For the coherence score:
The text lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The author makes many claims without proper support or explanation, and the text jumps between topics without clear transitions. The overall argument is disjointed and confusing. I would rate this as a 2 on the coherence scale.
