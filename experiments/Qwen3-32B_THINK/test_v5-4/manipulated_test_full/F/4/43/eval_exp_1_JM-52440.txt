Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to rate the given story on coherence and fluency using the provided criteria. First, I need to understand the story's content and structure.

The story is a theological treatise discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's structured into chapters covering the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The author argues against the doctrine of transubstantiation and real objective presence in the Eucharist, citing church documents like the Articles, Catechism, and Homilies.

Now, evaluating coherence. The story has a clear structure with distinct chapters and subtopics. The arguments are logically presented, each building on the previous one. However, there are some issues. The narrative is dense and complex, which might make it challenging for a general reader. Some sections, especially theological arguments, could be repetitive. Also, the flow between sections could be smoother in parts, where the transition from one argument to another isn't always clear. For example, moving from the discussion of the Articles to the Catechism and then to the Communion Service might benefit from better transitional phrases. Additionally, some paragraphs are very long and could be broken down for better readability. Despite these, the overall argument is coherent, and the structure supports the author's thesis.

For fluency, the text is written in formal, archaic language typical of theological works. There are instances of grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and run-on sentences. For example, some sentences are overly complex and difficult to parse, such as "If the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion." There are also some punctuation issues, like missing commas and periods. Additionally, there are a few typos and misspellings, such as "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." These errors disrupt the flow and readability. However, the majority of the text is grammatically correct and well-structured, with clear arguments and logical progression.

In summary, the story is coherent with a clear structure, but some sections could benefit from better transitions and paragraph breaks. Fluency is generally good, but there are grammatical and stylistic issues that hinder smooth reading.

Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors, including incorrect sentence structures and misplaced modifiers (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is").  
[SYNTAX] Awkward and overly complex sentence constructions that hinder readability (e.g., "If the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion").  
[LEXICON] Repetitive phrasing (e.g., repeated use of "the Church of England" and "Real Presence") and archaic or unclear terms (e.g., "transubstantiation," "consubstantiation").  
[LOGIC] Some logical jumps between arguments, particularly when transitioning between theological concepts (e.g., from the Articles to the Catechism).  
[CLARITY] Ambiguous or overly verbose explanations (e.g., "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating").  
[STRUCTURE] Long, dense paragraphs with minimal paragraph breaks, making the text feel monotonous and difficult to follow.  
[TRANSITION] Weak transitions between sections (e.g., abrupt shifts from discussing the Articles to the Catechism).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
