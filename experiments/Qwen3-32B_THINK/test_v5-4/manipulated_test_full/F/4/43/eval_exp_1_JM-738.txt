Okay, let me start by reading through the story provided. It's about the mystery of Edwin Drood and the analysis of Dickens's last plot. The story is quite complex with a lot of characters and a detailed plot. 

First, I need to evaluate the coherence. Coherence is about how well the story is structured and how smoothly the ideas flow from one to another. The story is an analysis of a mystery, so it's expected to have some complexity. However, I notice that the narrative jumps between different sections and characters without clear transitions. For example, the introduction moves from discussing Dickens's writing style to the characters in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without much connection. Also, some parts are repetitive, like the repeated mentions of Jasper's opium use and his relationship with the hag. The story also has a lot of subplots and theories that might confuse the reader if not clearly connected. The conclusion tries to tie things together, but the overall structure feels a bit disjointed.

Now, for fluency, which is about the grammatical correctness and smoothness of the text. The story has several grammatical errors. For example, there are run-on sentences, missing commas, and incorrect word order. Phrases like "About from had sketched nineteenth middle of Bud Mr. a somewhere, century" are confusing and don't make sense. There are also instances where words are jumbled or missing, such as "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”" The use of italics and underscores is inconsistent, which might be intentional for emphasis but still affects readability. Additionally, some sentences are awkwardly phrased, making them hard to follow.

Looking at the coherence issues more closely, the story has a clear progression in discussing the plot and theories, but the transitions between sections are abrupt. The introduction sets up the discussion about Dickens's construction in his novels, then moves into the characters of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," but the connection between these parts isn't smooth. The analysis of different theories (Proctor's, Walters's) is presented, but the flow between these sections is choppy. The conclusion attempts to summarize the theories and the likely outcome, but without clear links to the previous sections, it feels a bit abrupt.

For fluency, the grammatical errors are significant. There are sentences that start with fragments or have incorrect subject-verb agreement. For example, "He either in is a motive for case the scrutiny. Jasper part night" is a jumble of words that doesn't form a coherent sentence. The use of italics and underscores is inconsistent, which can confuse the reader. There are also instances where words are missing or misplaced, making the sentences hard to parse. The overall text reads as if it was written quickly without much editing for clarity and correctness.

Considering the coherence and fluency scores based on the provided scales. For coherence, the story is somewhat coherent but has issues with transitions and structure that make it hard to follow at times. The score would likely be a 3 because there are obvious abrupt shifts and some unclarity. For fluency, the grammatical errors and awkward phrasing are numerous enough to hinder the flow, so a 3 is appropriate as well.

Issues:  
[COHERENCE] The narrative structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between sections and characters. Key plot points and character relationships are often unclear or underdeveloped, leading to confusion. Repetition of details (e.g., Jasper’s opium use) and inconsistent pacing disrupt the logical flow. Theories about the mystery are presented without clear connections to the main plot, and the conclusion feels abrupt without resolving ambiguities.  
[FLUENCY] Numerous grammatical errors, including run-on sentences, missing commas, and incorrect word order (e.g., "About from had sketched nineteenth middle of Bud Mr. a somewhere, century"). Awkward phrasing and jumbled word sequences (e.g., "He either in is a motive for case the scrutiny") hinder readability. Inconsistent use of italics and underscores further disrupts the text.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
