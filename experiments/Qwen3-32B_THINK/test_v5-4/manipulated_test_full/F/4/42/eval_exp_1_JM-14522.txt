Okay, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate it for coherence and fluency using the provided criteria and scoring scales. 

First, I need to identify the issues in the text under the categories of coherence and fluency. Let me start with fluency. Fluency is about the smoothness of the text, grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

Looking through the story, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, in the line "It must be removed at once," the verb tense is correct, but later there's "It caned was seen." Wait, that's not right. The correct form should be "It could not be seen." So that's a grammar issue. Another example is "The whole family were now quite interested" – "were" might be incorrect if the subject is "family" which is singular. Also, "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." The semicolon usage here is correct, but maybe the sentence is a bit long. 

There are instances of incorrect past participle usage, like "had was" in "the stain... had been much admired... and cannot be removed." Also, "he had been extremely upset" – "had been" might be correct, but need to check the tense. 

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the story. The story is a classic ghost story with a clear narrative, but are there any abrupt shifts or inconsistencies? The transition between chapters is smooth, but there might be some parts where the narrative jumps. For example, the ghost's backstory is introduced in the first chapter, and then later, in chapter V, Virginia interacts with the ghost, which is a significant shift. But the story does tie these elements together, so maybe that's okay. 

Another point is the consistency of the ghost's character. The ghost is portrayed as a traditional, menacing figure but also has comedic elements due to the American family's reactions. This mix could be intentional, but if it's inconsistent, it might affect coherence. 

Looking at the ending, the resolution of the ghost's story is clear, with Virginia's compassion leading to his peaceful death. The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, so the structure seems coherent. 

Now, checking for specific issues in the text. In chapter V, there's a line: "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement..." The semicolon usage here is correct, but the sentence is a bit long. 

In chapter VI, "having sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran home..." The structure here is a bit complex but still clear. 

For coherence, are there any plot holes or inconsistencies? The ghost's motivation shifts from wanting to scare the family to seeking peace, which is driven by Virginia's actions. This is a logical progression. The blood stain returning despite cleaning is a consistent element that ties into the ghost's presence. 

Now, listing the issues:

Fluency issues:
- Incorrect verb tenses: "coulded was seen" should be "could be seen"
- Incorrect past participle: "had was" should be "had been"
- Subject-verb agreement: "The whole family were" if "family" is singular
- Spelling errors: "coulded" is incorrect
- Sentence structure: Some sentences are overly long or complex
- Punctuation: Some semicolons and commas might be misused

Coherence issues:
- Sudden shifts in narrative perspective, like the story being told from a third-person omniscient viewpoint, which is generally coherent but may have moments where the flow is disrupted
- The ghost's backstory is introduced early, which is necessary for coherence, but some details might be better integrated
- The resolution is clear, but the transition from the ghost's torment to his redemption is handled smoothly

Scoring: For fluency, there are several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing, but the overall text is readable. Maybe a 3. For coherence, the story is well-structured with a clear narrative, so a 4 or 5. However, there might be minor inconsistencies or abrupt shifts that lower it to a 4.
