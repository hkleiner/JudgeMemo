Alright, I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding the requirements. 

First, for Coherence, I need to assess how well the story is structured, how logically the ideas are connected, and whether there are any abrupt shifts or inconsistencies. The story is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. It has chapters, sections, and detailed arguments. I'll check if the narrative flows smoothly from one point to the next, and if the arguments are logically presented.

For Fluency, I need to look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite long and dense with theological terminology. I'll check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with clarity that might hinder readability.

Now, let me go through the story step by step.

**Coherence:**
- The story is well-structured with clear chapters and sections, which helps in organizing the arguments. Each chapter addresses a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice).
- The arguments are presented in a logical sequence, starting with the introduction of the topic, then moving into detailed examination of the Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, and Homilies.
- However, the text is quite dense and assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the subject. This might make it less accessible to a general audience, but it's appropriate for the intended readership (theological scholars or members of the Church of England).
- There are some minor jumps in logic where the author references previous points without always clearly connecting them back to the current argument. For example, when discussing the Homilies, the author makes assertions that rely on the reader's familiarity with the previous sections.
- Overall, the story maintains a coherent structure and logical progression of ideas, though it's quite specialized.

**Fluency:**
- The text is written in Early Modern English, with archaic spellings and phrasing ("was" instead of "is", "thee" instead of "you"). This is consistent with the style of theological works from the 19th century.
- There are several grammatical issues, including inconsistent verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. For example, "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lordâ€™s Supper."
- There are instances of missing prepositions and incorrect word usage. For example, "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue" should be "In doing this, our first business is..."
- Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth: 'The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the meant whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.'"
- There are some spelling errors and archaic spellings that might be confusing to modern readers, but these are consistent with the style of the text.
- Overall, the text is grammatically sound in its archaic style, but the complexity of the sentences and the specialized vocabulary may affect readability for some readers.

Based on these observations, I'll now summarize the issues and assign scores.

Issues:  
- [COHERENCE] The text is well-structured with clear sections and logical progression of arguments. However, the dense theological content and assumptions of prior knowledge may limit accessibility. Some transitions between sections are abrupt, and references to previous points lack clear connections.  
- [FLUENCY] The text uses archaic language and complex sentence structures that may hinder readability. There are grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., "In did this" instead of "In doing this"), subject-verb agreement issues, and missing prepositions. Some sentences are overly long and difficult to parse.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
