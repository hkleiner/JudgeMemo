I'll analyze the given story according to the evaluation criteria for coherence and fluency.

First, let's examine the coherence of the story:

The story is a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer. It follows a chronological structure, starting with an introduction and then progressing through various chapters of Bradley's life and career.

Coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The story has a complex structure with multiple chapters, but there are occasional jumps in time or narrative voice that might confuse readers.
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between paragraphs feel abrupt or lack clear connections, especially when moving between different periods in Bradley's life.
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses complex sentences that could be clearer, particularly when discussing typographic and design concepts.
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice shifts between first-person and third-person at times, which can be disorienting.

Now, let's examine the fluency of the story:

Fluency refers to how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, and word choice.

Fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues, particularly with verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex or have awkward structures.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are occasional punctuation issues, especially with commas and quotation marks.
- [WORD CHOICE] Some word choices seem slightly off or could be more precise, particularly when discussing technical aspects of printing and design.

Based on my analysis, I would rate the story as follows:

Coherence: I notice some structural issues and occasional logical jumps, but the overall narrative is generally clear and follows a chronological progression. The story maintains a consistent focus on Bradley's life and career.

Fluency: There are some grammatical and syntactic issues, but the text is generally well-written with appropriate vocabulary for the subject matter. The complex subject matter requires some complex sentences, which are mostly handled well.

I'll now provide my final scores:
