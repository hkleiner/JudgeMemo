I need to evaluate the given story on two criteria: coherence and fluency.

First, let me understand the story. It appears to be an academic analysis of Charles Dickens's unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The text discusses various theories about the story's unresolved plot, including theories by R.A. Proctor and Cuming Walters. It also analyzes the characters, plot structure, and some of Dickens's intentions based on Forster's accounts and other evidence.

Now, let me evaluate the text for coherence and fluency.

For Coherence:
- Is the text logically structured and easy to follow?
- Does it maintain a clear progression of ideas?
- Are the ideas connected smoothly?
- Is there a consistent theme or narrative?

For Fluency:
- Is the text grammatically correct?
- Is the syntax and word choice appropriate?
- Does the text flow smoothly from one sentence to the next?
- Are there any awkward phrasings or errors that disrupt the reading experience?

Let me now identify specific issues:

Coherence Issues:
- The text is highly academic and dense with analysis, which can make it challenging to follow at times.
- There are many nested ideas and theories being discussed, which can create a sense of disorganization.
- The text jumps between different theories and interpretations without always clearly signaling these transitions.
- Some paragraphs are very long and contain multiple ideas without clear separation.
- The structure is not always clear, especially in the middle sections where different theories are being compared and contrasted.

Fluency Issues:
- There are several instances of missing words or strange phrasings like "the thing" and "a stuff" that appear to be placeholders or errors.
- The text contains many complex sentences that are difficult to parse.
- There are some grammatical errors and awkward constructions.
- The use of ellipses and incomplete sentences is frequent.
- The text has a very formal and academic tone, which can make it feel less fluent to some readers.

Based on my analysis:

Coherence Score:
The text maintains a general structure and follows a logical progression in discussing theories about the story. However, the complexity of the content and the dense academic style make it somewhat challenging to follow at times. The frequent use of "the thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders also disrupts the flow of ideas. I would rate this as a 3 - coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.

Fluency Score:
The text contains numerous errors and awkward phrasings that would make it difficult for even an experienced reader to follow smoothly. The frequent use of "the thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders is particularly disruptive to fluency. The complex sentence structures and academic tone also contribute to a less fluent reading experience. I would rate this as a 2 - there are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

Let me now finalize my ratings with a more detailed explanation of the issues.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly dense and academic, with many nested ideas and theories discussed in a complex manner.
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different theories and interpretations without always clearly signaling these transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are very long and contain multiple ideas without clear separation, making the text difficult to follow at times.
- [TRANSITION] The structure is not always clear, especially in the middle sections where different theories are being compared and contrasted.
- [SPELLING] There are several instances of missing words or strange phrasings like "the thing" and "a stuff" that appear to be placeholders or errors.
- [SYNTAX] The text contains many complex sentences that are difficult to parse, with some grammatical errors and awkward constructions.
- [LEXICON] The use of ellipses and incomplete sentences is frequent, and the text has a very formal and academic tone that can make it feel less fluent to some readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
