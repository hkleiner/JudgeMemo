Alright, let me approach this task systematically. I need to evaluate the given story according to the criteria of Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. Let's start by understanding what these criteria mean.

**Coherence** assesses how well the story unfolds as a whole. It looks at whether the ideas are logically sequenced, smoothly connected, and if there's a clear progression from one section to another. It also considers if there are any ambiguities or abrupt jumps in the narrative.

**Fluency** evaluates how the text reads from start to finish. It focuses on the syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It looks for smooth reading without awkward phrasing or errors.

Now, let me read through the story and identify any issues.

**Issues in Coherence:**
1. [LOGIC] The story is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. While it is well-structured in its arguments, the content is highly specialized and may be difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the theological context. The logical flow is generally good within each section, but the overall narrative could be challenging for a general audience due to the dense content.
2. [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into chapters and sections, which helps with organization. However, the transition between sections is sometimes abrupt, especially when moving from one theological point to another without clear signposts or summaries.
3. [CLARITY] Some of the language is very dense and complex, which can reduce clarity. For example, phrases like "The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner" are grammatically correct but can be difficult to parse quickly.
4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother. The story often moves from one theological argument to another without clear transitional phrases or sentences that help the reader follow the flow of ideas.

**Issues in Fluency:**
1. [GRAMMAR] There are a few grammatical issues. For example, "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." The word "stuff" seems to be a placeholder or error, likely intended to be "Church."
2. [SPELLING] I don't notice any spelling errors in the text.
3. [SYNTAX] The syntax is generally complex due to the subject matter, but it's mostly correct. Some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for better readability.
4. [LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter but may be too specialized for a general audience.
5. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is generally correct, though there are some instances where commas and periods could be used more effectively in long sentences.

Let me now provide a score for each criterion:

**Coherence Score:**
The story is well-structured and logically presented within each section, but the dense content and complex language may make it challenging for a general audience to follow the overall argument. The transitions between sections could be smoother, and some of the language is quite dense. I would give it a 3 for Coherence.

**Fluency Score:**
The text is generally fluent, with only minor grammatical issues. The complex syntax and specialized vocabulary are appropriate for the subject matter but may be difficult for some readers. I would give it a 4 for Fluency.

Let me review these assessments once more to ensure accuracy:

**Coherence:**
- The story is well-structured in its arguments, but the dense content and complex language may make it challenging for a general audience to follow the overall argument.
- The transitions between sections could be smoother, and some of the language is quite dense.
- The logical flow is generally good within each section, but the overall narrative could be challenging for a general audience due to the specialized content.
- I would give it a 3 for Coherence.

**Fluency:**
- The text is generally fluent, with only minor grammatical issues.
- The complex syntax and specialized vocabulary are appropriate for the subject matter but may be difficult for some readers.
- I would give it a 4 for Fluency.

Let me now write out my final answer in the requested format:

Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. While it is well-structured in its arguments, the content is highly specialized and may be difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the theological context. The logical flow is generally good within each section, but the overall narrative could be challenging for a general audience due to the dense content.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
