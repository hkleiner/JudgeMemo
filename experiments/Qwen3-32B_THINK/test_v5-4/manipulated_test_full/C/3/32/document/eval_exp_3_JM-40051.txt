Let me analyze the story according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll identify the issues with fluency (syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation):

[GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example:
- "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing" - "the thing" seems to be a placeholder that should be a specific publication name
- "have been opening to the minds of some" - "opening" is not the correct verb form
- "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" - awkward phrasing
- "This is the garden of a thing" - incomplete thought
- "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large" - awkward phrasing
- "I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion" - awkward phrasing
- "This is the garden of Eden" - should be "This is the Garden of Eden" with capitalization
- "of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" - awkward phrasing
- "and admirirg its most wonderful scenery" - spelling error (admirirg should be "admiring")

[SYNTAX] - There are numerous syntactical issues that make the text difficult to follow:
- Run-on sentences that are too long and complex
- Missing commas and other punctuation
- Awkward sentence structures that don't flow naturally

[LEXICON] - There are inappropriate word choices and missing words:
- "the plat" - "plat" is an archaic term that should be defined
- "a scientest" - misspelling of "scientist"
- "the stuff" - repeated use of "the stuff" as a placeholder for specific terms
- "a thing" - repeated use of "a thing" as a placeholder
- "a thing" - repeated use of "a thing" as a placeholder
- "a stuff" - repeated use of "a stuff" as a placeholder
- "a thing" - repeated use of "a thing" as a placeholder
- "a stuff" - repeated use of "a stuff" as a placeholder
- "a thing" - repeated use of "a thing" as a placeholder

[SPACING] - There are inconsistent spacing issues:
- Extra spaces between words
- Missing spaces between words
- Inconsistent use of italics and quotation marks

Now for issues with coherence (logical sequence, connected ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities):

[LOGIC] - The text lacks a clear logical progression:
- The author jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions
- The argument is repetitive and circular
- There are many unsupported claims without evidence
- The text seems to be written as a series of disconnected observations rather than a coherent argument

[STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear structure:
- There is no clear introduction, body, or conclusion
- The flow of ideas is disjointed
- There is no clear thesis or central argument that the text is building toward

[CLARITY] - The text is often unclear:
- The author uses placeholder terms like "the stuff" and "a thing" throughout the text
- The writing is overly verbose and repetitive
- The author makes many grandiose claims without providing clear evidence or reasoning
- The text is filled with unsupported assertions

[TRANSITION] - The text lacks smooth transitions between ideas:
- The author often jumps from one topic to another without connecting them
- There are no clear signposts or transitions to guide the reader through the text
- The flow of ideas is disjointed and confusing

Based on the evaluation criteria and the issues I've identified:

For Coherence:
The text lacks a clear logical progression, structure, and transitions. The author's argument is repetitive and circular, with many unsupported claims. The flow of ideas is disjointed, and the text lacks a clear thesis or central argument. The score would be around a 2.

For Fluency:
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inappropriate word choices. There are also spacing and punctuation issues. The text is difficult to read and understand. The score would be around a 2.

Let me refine my evaluation:

Coherence: The text is filled with unsupported claims and lacks a clear logical progression. The author jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions. While there is a central topic (the Garden of Eden), the argument is repetitive and circular. The text is disjointed and lacks a clear structure. I would rate this a 2 on the coherence scale.

Fluency: The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inappropriate word choices. The author frequently uses placeholder terms like "the stuff" and "a thing" which make the text difficult to understand. The text is filled with spelling errors and awkward sentence structures. I would rate this a 2 on the fluency scale.
