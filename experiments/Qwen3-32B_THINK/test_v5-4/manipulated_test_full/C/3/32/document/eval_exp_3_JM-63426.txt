I need to evaluate the given story according to the specified criteria for coherence and fluency, identifying issues in each category and then providing scores.

Let me start by reading through the story to understand what it's about and identify potential issues.

The story appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer, told in the form of a chapbook. It's written in the first person, as if by Bradley himself, and follows his life from childhood to retirement. The story is divided into chapters that chronologically document his career and contributions to the field of design.

Now, I'll look for issues related to coherence and fluency.

For coherence, I'll look for:
- Logical sequencing of ideas
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Overall organization and structure
- Consistency in narrative
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps

For fluency, I'll look for:
- Proper grammar and syntax
- Correct spelling
- Appropriate word choice
- Smooth phrasing and punctuation
- Overall readability

Let me now go through the text and identify issues in each category.

Coherence issues:
1. [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. For example, the text moves abruptly from childhood memories to professional achievements.
2. [LOGIC] Some events are mentioned without sufficient context or explanation. For instance, the story mentions various historical figures and events without establishing their relevance to Bradley's story.
3. [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with repetitive elements and a lack of clear progression. Some sections seem to be inserted without a clear connection to the narrative flow.
4. [CLARITY] The narrative is often unclear about who is speaking or writing. The text switches between first-person narration and third-person biographical account without clear indication.
5. [LOGIC] There are inconsistencies in the timeline and events. For example, the text mentions events from different years but doesn't always maintain a clear chronological order.
6. [STRUCTURE] The story includes many specific details about typography, printing, and design that may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter without proper context.

Fluency issues:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text. For example, "You are six years old; next month you will be seven" is missing a comma after the semicolon.
2. [SPELLING] There are occasional spelling errors, such as "stuff" which appears frequently and seems to be a placeholder for actual place names.
3. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and sometimes confusing. For example, "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week" uses an em dash instead of a more appropriate punctuation mark.
4. [LEXICON] The text uses outdated or obscure vocabulary that may be difficult for modern readers to understand without context.
5. [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation throughout the text, including inconsistent use of commas, periods, and quotation marks.
6. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and lack proper conjunctions or punctuation to separate clauses.
7. [SPELLING] There are instances of repeated words or phrases that could have been more clearly expressed.
8. [GRAMMAR] There are subject-verb agreement issues in some sentences.
9. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward word order that makes them difficult to read.
10. [SPELLING] There are instances of missing or incorrect capitalization.

Now, I'll provide scores for both coherence and fluency based on the evaluation criteria.

For coherence:
The story has some coherence in that it follows a chronological structure, but there are significant issues with transitions, logical flow, and overall organization. The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear connections. The narrative is often unclear about who is speaking or writing, and there are inconsistencies in the timeline and events. The text includes many specific details about typography and printing that may be confusing without context.

For fluency:
The text has many grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and awkward sentence structures. There are frequent spelling errors, particularly with the word "stuff" which appears to be used as a placeholder. The vocabulary is often outdated or obscure, making the text difficult to read for a general audience. The sentence structure is complex and sometimes confusing.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence as a 3 and the fluency as a 2.

Let me now provide my final evaluation:

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story has a disjointed structure with abrupt transitions between different time periods and topics.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies and events mentioned without sufficient context or explanation.
- [CLARITY] The narrative is often unclear about who is speaking or writing.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has repetitive elements and lacks a clear progression.
- [LOGIC] The timeline and events are inconsistent at times.
- [STRUCTURE] The story includes many specific details about typography and printing that may be confusing without context.
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text.
- [SPELLING] There are occasional spelling errors, particularly with the word "stuff" which appears to be a placeholder.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and confusing.
- [LEXICON] The text uses outdated or obscure vocabulary that may be difficult for modern readers to understand.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation throughout the text, including inconsistent use of commas, periods, and quotation marks.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
