Let me analyze this story for coherence and fluency based on the provided evaluation criteria.

First, I'll go through the story to identify issues:

For Coherence:
- The story is attempting to identify a specific location in the United States as the Garden of Eden based on biblical descriptions.
- The narrative is extremely long and detailed, with many geographical descriptions and religious references.
- There is a logical progression in the author's argument, but it becomes repetitive and meandering.
- The story jumps between different aspects of the location (geography, history, religious significance) without clear transitions.
- There are numerous references to specific places and features without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with the region.
- The author frequently brings in tangential information that doesn't directly support the main argument.
- The story lacks a clear narrative arc or conclusion, ending abruptly.
- There are references to other people's opinions and theories without clear organization or connection to the main argument.

For Fluency:
- There are numerous spelling errors (e.g., "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "beatiful" instead of "beautiful").
- There are grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues).
- There are punctuation issues (e.g., missing commas, incorrect use of dashes, run-on sentences).
- There are awkward phrasings and sentence structures.
- Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted.
- There are some instances of typographical errors.
- There are anachronisms (e.g., mentions of modern technology like "holographic map" in a story that appears to be written in the late 19th century).

Let me now organize these observations into the required format:

Issues:
[LOGIC] The argument becomes repetitive and meandering, with the author circling back to the same points multiple times without building a coherent narrative.
[STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative structure, jumping between different aspects of the location and argument without clear transitions.
[CLARITY] The text is often unclear, with references to specific places and features without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with the region.
[TRANSITION] The story lacks smooth transitions between different ideas and sections.
[LEXICON] There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text.
[GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors in many sentences.
[SYNTAX] There are sentence structure issues and awkward phrasings.
[REPETITION] The author frequently repeats the same points and phrases.
[ANACHRONISM] There are anachronistic references to modern technology in what appears to be a 19th-century narrative.
[PUNCTUATION] There are punctuation errors throughout the text.
[COHERENCE] The text lacks overall coherence, with the argument not clearly building to a conclusion.

Now, let me assign scores based on the metrics:

For Coherence:
The story has a logical progression in the author's argument, but it becomes repetitive and meandering. There are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies. The narrative lacks a clear arc and ends abruptly. The author brings in tangential information without clear connection to the main argument. There are many references to other people's opinions and theories without clear organization.

Based on the metric scale, I would give this a Coherence Score of 2. It has many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.

For Fluency:
The text has numerous spelling errors, grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and awkward phrasings. Many sentences are overly complex or convoluted. The text is difficult to read smoothly due to these issues.

Based on the metric scale, I would give this a Fluency Score of 2. There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.
