I'll analyze the story according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, let me understand the task:
1. Identify problems in the text that lead to point deductions, categorizing them with labels like [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION], etc.
2. Provide a final score for Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5 based on the accuracy scales provided.

Let me now analyze the story for issues:

**Fluency issues**:
[GRAMMAR] - There are some minor grammatical issues, though they don't significantly impact reading. For example: "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" (should be "which you never forget" or "that you never forget").

[SYNTAX] - Some sentences have slightly awkward syntax, but they're generally clear. For example: "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." The sentence structure is clear but slightly abrupt.

[LEXICON] - There are some instances of word choice that could be improved. For example: "He brings you a box of pi." "Pi" seems to be a typo for "type" or "type metal" in the context of printing.

**Coherence issues**:
[STRUCTURE] - The story has a well-defined structure with clear chapters that follow a chronological narrative of Will Bradley's life and career.

[LOGIC] - The narrative flows logically, following the life of Will Bradley from childhood to old age, and his contributions to the field of printing and design.

[TRANSITION] - There are some smooth transitions between chapters and sections, but occasionally the transitions could be smoother. For example, the sudden shift from one chapter to another without clear transition sentences could be improved.

[CLARITY] - The text is generally clear, though some of the historical and technical details related to printing might be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the field.

Let me now rate the story:

**Fluency Score**: 4
The story is mostly fluent with only minor grammatical issues that don't significantly affect reading. The syntax is generally clear, though some sentences could be more elegant. The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter, though there are a few minor word choice issues.

**Coherence Score**: 4
The story has a clear structure and logical flow, following the life and career of Will Bradley. The narrative is generally well-organized and the transitions between chapters are mostly effective. There are some minor issues with clarity regarding the technical aspects of printing, but these don't significantly impact the overall coherence.

Now I'll summarize the issues and provide the scores as requested:
</think>

Issues: 
- [SPELLING] There are a few spelling errors such as "pi" (should be "type") and "Narrow Gauge" (should be "Narrow Gauge" or "Narrow Gauge" depending on context).
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues like "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" (should be "which you never forget" or "that you never forget").
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between sections could be smoother, particularly between the different chapters.
- [CLARITY] Some technical details related to printing and design may be less clear to readers unfamiliar with the field.
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences have slightly awkward syntax, such as "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work."

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
