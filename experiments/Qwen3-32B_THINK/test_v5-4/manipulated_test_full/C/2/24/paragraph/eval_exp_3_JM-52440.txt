Okay, let's start by reading through the user's query carefully. They want me to evaluate a given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided Likert scale. The story is a religious text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Coherence refers to the logical flow and structure of the narrative, ensuring that ideas are connected smoothly and the story progresses clearly. Fluency is about the grammatical correctness, syntax, word choice, and overall readability of the text.

Looking at the story, it's a formal theological discourse with chapters, articles, and references to various religious documents. The structure is clear with an introduction, chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice, and each section is logically divided. However, the story is quite long and dense, which might affect coherence if there are abrupt shifts or unclear transitions.

For Coherence, I should check if each chapter builds on the previous one, if there are logical connections between the arguments presented, and if there's a clear progression from one topic to another. The story seems to follow a logical structure, starting with the introduction of the topic, then discussing each aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) in separate chapters. Each chapter is well-organized with subpoints. However, the frequent use of theological jargon and complex sentences might make the flow less smooth for some readers. Also, there are some repetitive points, especially in the arguments against the Real Presence, which could slightly reduce coherence.

For Fluency, I need to look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with syntax. The story is written in a formal, archaic style with complex sentence structures, which is typical for theological texts. However, this might lead to some sentences being difficult to parse. For example, long sentences with multiple clauses could be confusing. I'll need to check for any grammatical errors, but given the formal nature, minor issues might be overlooked. The use of passive voice is common, which is acceptable in such contexts but might affect readability. There are also some instances of repetition of ideas, which could be seen as a fluency issue if they make the text feel redundant.

Now, looking for specific issues. Under Coherence, I notice that the story transitions between different chapters and sections smoothly, but some sections, like the discussion of the Articles and Catechism, might be dense and could benefit from clearer transitions. There's also the use of rhetorical questions and arguments that might disrupt the flow if not clearly connected to the main thesis. Under Fluency, there are complex sentences that could be simplified for better readability. Some sentences are quite long and might be split for clarity. Also, there are a few instances where the same point is restated, which could be considered repetition affecting fluency.

The story also includes some non-essential sentences like "A keyboard clicked without being touched." and "The energy grid remained balanced." These seem out of place and might be considered as errors or distractions. They don't contribute to the main argument and could be removed for coherence.

In terms of scoring, for Coherence, the story is generally well-structured with logical progression, but the dense content and occasional repetition might lower the score slightly. For Fluency, while the text is grammatically correct and uses formal language appropriately, the complex sentences and some redundancies might affect the flow, leading to a score in the middle range.

After evaluating all these points, I can list the issues under their respective categories and assign the final scores.

Issues:  
- [COHERENCE] The story has abrupt transitions between dense theological arguments and unrelated phrases (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched," "The energy grid remained balanced"). These fragments disrupt the logical flow and narrative focus.  
- [COHERENCE] Repetition of arguments (e.g., repeated emphasis on the distinction between "sign" and "thing signified") reduces clarity and creates redundancy.  
- [COHERENCE] Some sections (e.g., discussions of Articles and Catechism) lack clear transitions, making the progression between ideas feel disjointed.  
- [FLUENCY] Overly complex and archaic sentence structures (e.g., "It is hereby declared, that thereby no adoration is intended...") hinder readability.  
- [FLUENCY] Excessive passive voice and nominalizations (e.g., "It is hereby declared") make sentences feel cumbersome.  
- [FLUENCY] Minor grammatical issues (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject") disrupt smooth reading.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
