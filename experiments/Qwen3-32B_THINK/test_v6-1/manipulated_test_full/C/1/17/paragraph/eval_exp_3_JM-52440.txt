Okay, let's start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence. First, I need to understand the criteria for each.

For fluency, I'm checking for grammatical correctness, repetition, and natural phrasing. If there are any grammatical errors or awkward sentences, that would lower the score. The text seems to be a religious or theological essay, which is quite long and detailed. I'll need to go through it carefully.

Looking at the text, the first thing I notice is that it's written in an archaic style with complex sentences and some old-fashioned vocabulary. This might make it a bit hard to read for modern readers, but it's not necessarily a fluency issue if it's consistent and clear. However, I do see some potential issues. For example, there are instances where the structure is confusing, like the sentence starting with "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth..." which is a bit wordy and could be clearer. Also, there are some run-on sentences that might be split into shorter ones for better readability.

Another point is the use of some terms that might not be immediately clear, like "transubstantiation" and "transaccidentation," but these are technical terms in the context of theology, so maybe that's acceptable. However, if they're not explained, it could be a problem. The text also includes some rhetorical questions and exclamations which might affect the flow, but again, in a persuasive or argumentative essay, this could be intentional.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow together and whether the text is logically structured. The text is divided into chapters and sections, which is good, but I need to check if each section transitions smoothly and if the arguments are logically presented. 

The introduction sets up the debate about the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Real Presence, which is followed by chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each chapter seems to address a specific point, which is logical. However, there are some parts where the flow is disrupted. For example, there's a sudden mention of a character from Dickens ("Princess Puffer") and another about Millet's artwork, which seems out of place in a theological discussion. These could be examples of the text lacking coherence as they don't directly relate to the main argument. 

Additionally, some paragraphs start with a point and then go off on tangents, which might confuse the reader. For instance, the section about Jasper from Dickens is a detailed analysis of a fictional character, which doesn't contribute to the theological argument. Similarly, the mention of Diderot and the American teacher seems random and might be errors or misplaced text. These instances disrupt the coherence of the main argument.

There are also some abrupt shifts in tone and subject. The text moves from a formal theological discussion to a more personal or anecdotal style in certain parts, which might not be as effective in maintaining a coherent argument. For example, the part about the newspaper and the character George Stransom feels out of place and doesn't tie into the main topic.

In terms of structure, the conclusion at the end does wrap up the argument, but the various digressions and unrelated examples might make the overall structure less cohesive. The use of quotes and references to historical documents is appropriate, but when mixed with unrelated content, it can dilute the main message.

So, summarizing the fluency issues: some complex or awkward sentence structures, potential run-on sentences, and the use of technical terms without explanation. For coherence: unrelated examples and digressions that disrupt the flow, abrupt shifts in topic, and some parts that don't clearly support the main argument.

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, the text is mostly readable but has some issues that could be distracting. I might give it a 3.5 or 4. For coherence, the main argument is there, but the unrelated content and digressions lower the score, maybe a 3 or 3.5. I need to check the exact criteria again to ensure the scores align with the scale provided.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and archaic sentence structures (e.g., "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth...").  
- [LEXICON] Obscure or archaic terminology (e.g., "transaccidentation," "cog-wheels of a society") without contextual explanation.  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in rhetorical questions (e.g., "Will any one believe us? ‘Come and see!’ Dr. Warner and all. Take this description...").  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and fragmented clauses (e.g., "If the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion. But those who are loyal to the Church of England...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unrelated digressions (e.g., analysis of Dickens’ "Princess Puffer" and Millet’s artwork).  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed transitions between theological arguments and anecdotal narratives (e.g., the George Stransom and Diderot vignettes).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous connections between paragraphs (e.g., abrupt shifts from doctrinal analysis to unrelated historical anecdotes).  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent focus on the central thesis due to tangential examples (e.g., the American teacher directive and Pall Mall references).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
