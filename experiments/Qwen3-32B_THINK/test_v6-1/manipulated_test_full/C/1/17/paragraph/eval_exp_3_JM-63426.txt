Let me analyze the text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Issues

1. **[GRAMMAR] - Subject-verb agreement issues** - There are occasional instances where the subject and verb don't agree in number.
2. **[GRAMMAR] - Pronoun reference issues** - Some pronouns refer to multiple possible antecedents, creating ambiguity.
3. **[SPELLING] - Inconsistent spelling** - There are some instances of inconsistent spelling, particularly with names and terms.
4. **[SYNTAX] - Awkward phrasing** - Some sentences have awkward structure that makes them difficult to understand.
5. **[LEXICON] - Inconsistent tense usage** - The text switches between different verb tenses without clear explanation or pattern.
6. **[SYNTAX] - Run-on sentences** - Some sentences are very long and contain multiple ideas without clear separation.
7. **[SYNTAX] - Missing articles or prepositions** - There are instances where necessary articles or prepositions are missing.
8. **[GRAMMAR] - Misused words** - Some words are used in ways that don't match their standard meanings.
9. **[SYNTAX] - Overuse of passive voice** - The text relies heavily on passive constructions, which can make it less engaging.
10. **[SYNTAX] - Incomplete sentences** - There are a few instances where sentences appear to be incomplete or cut off.

### Coherence Issues

1. **[LOGIC] - Sudden shifts in topic** - The text sometimes shifts abruptly from one topic to another without clear transitions.
2. **[STRUCTURE] - Inconsistent narrative perspective** - The text switches between first-person and third-person narration without clear explanation.
3. **[STRUCTURE] - Disjointed sections** - Some sections feel disconnected from the overall narrative.
4. **[LOGIC] - Unexplained references** - There are references to people, events, and works that are not explained for readers who might not be familiar with them.
5. **[STRUCTURE] - Inconsistent chronology** - The timeline of events is not always clear or consistent.
6. **[LOGIC] - Contradictory statements** - There are some statements that appear to contradict each other or the established narrative.
7. **[STRUCTURE] - Missing context** - Some passages lack the necessary context to understand their significance.
8. **[LOGIC] - Unrelated anecdotes** - Some anecdotes or descriptions seem to be included without a clear connection to the main narrative.
9. **[STRUCTURE] - Repetition** - Some information is repeated unnecessarily.
10. **[LOGIC] - Unclear purpose** - The overall purpose or message of the text is not always clear, particularly in the later sections.

Based on these observations:

### Fluency Score:
The text has a number of grammatical, syntactic, and lexical issues that affect readability. While it is generally understandable, the frequent errors and awkward phrasing would give it a score of around 3.5.

### Coherence Score:
The text has significant issues with logical flow, structure, and narrative perspective. While it tells a story about Will Bradley, the frequent shifts in perspective, lack of clear transitions, and inclusion of unrelated material make it difficult to follow at times. This would give it a score of around 3.5 as well.
