Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency issues. The text is quite long, so I'll need to go through it carefully. 

Looking at the first few paragraphs, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians". There's also "admirirg" which is likely a typo for "admiring". These are clear spelling mistakes that affect fluency.

Next, there are some grammatical issues. The sentence "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" seems to have a formatting problem with the word "CHAPTER" in all caps, which might be a typo or a misplaced label. Also, "the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden" has a run-on sentence and awkward structure.

Another issue is the use of inconsistent tenses and pronouns. For instance, "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" uses "He" and "him" which could be confusing. Also, some sentences are fragmented or lack proper punctuation, like "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." The comma splice here is a problem.

Moving on to coherence, the text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Garden of Eden, it shifts to a description of geographical features without connecting them logically. The author also introduces new points without linking them back to the main argument, making it hard to follow the overall structure.

There are also some logical inconsistencies. The text claims to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location, but then shifts to unrelated topics like the dairying industry in Wisconsin. These shifts disrupt the flow and make the argument less coherent. Additionally, the author uses a lot of biblical references and comparisons without clearly explaining how they relate to the main thesis, which can confuse the reader.

Another coherence issue is the repetition of phrases and ideas. The author repeatedly emphasizes the superiority of the described location without providing new evidence, which makes the argument feel redundant. Also, some sections, like the one about the "North West" and the "Father of Waters," are mentioned but not elaborated on, leaving the reader with unresolved points.

I also noticed that the text includes some unrelated anecdotes or examples, such as the part about the motor car and the landlord. These seem out of place and don't contribute to the main argument, further fragmenting the coherence.

In terms of structure, the text lacks clear paragraphs or sections that would help organize the content. The flow is choppy, with abrupt transitions between topics. The author also uses a lot of technical terms and specific names without defining them, which can be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the context.

Overall, while the text has some interesting ideas, the fluency and coherence issues significantly impact the readability and persuasiveness of the argument. The grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and lack of logical flow make it difficult to follow the author's points. The coherence issues are particularly pronounced due to the disjointed structure and frequent topic shifts.
