Alright, let me go through this process step by step. First, I need to evaluate the text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria. The text is a theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Eucharist. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammatical correctness, clarity, and natural phrasing. The text is written in a formal, archaic style with complex sentences. There are some instances where the structure is convoluted, making it harder to follow. For example, the use of long, multi-clause sentences might be a bit overwhelming. However, there are no obvious grammatical errors. The vocabulary is appropriate, though the archaic tone might affect modern readers' fluency. 

Next, coherence. The text is organized into chapters and sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the doctrine. The logical flow seems to be there, as each section builds on the previous one. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs, and the dense content might make it challenging for readers to follow the argument without prior knowledge of the subject. The use of theological terms and references to historical documents requires a certain level of familiarity, which could affect overall coherence.

For the fluency issues, I notice that some sentences are overly complex, which could be a syntax issue. There's also a mix of archaic and modern language, which might create a dissonance. For coherence, the main problem is the dense content and the assumption of prior knowledge, leading to potential confusion for the reader. The structure is generally logical, but some transitions between ideas are abrupt.

Now, assigning the scores. Fluency: The text is mostly fluent with complex but correct sentences. However, the archaic style and some convoluted syntax might lower the score slightly. I'll go with 4. Coherence: The organization is good, but the dense content and lack of clear transitions might make it less coherent for some readers. I'll rate it a 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with excessive subclauses reduce readability. - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("IT is a very easy thing," "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—") creates dissonance. - [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to historical documents without clear context (e.g., "Bonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley").  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between theological arguments and historical anecdotes (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched" intrudes into doctrinal analysis). - [LOGIC] Dense theological content assumes prior knowledge, risking confusion for readers unfamiliar with Eucharistic debates. - [CLARITY] Repetition of core arguments (e.g., repeated emphasis on "real presence" vs. "spiritual presence") without clear progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
