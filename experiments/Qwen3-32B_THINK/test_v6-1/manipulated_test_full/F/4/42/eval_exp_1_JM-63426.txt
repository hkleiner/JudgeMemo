Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency issues. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, a designer and printer. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and issues with clarity.

First, I notice some grammatical issues:
- "I have encounter here" should be "I have encountered here" (missing "d" in encountered)
- "It should be talk about" should be "It should be talked about" (incorrect verb form)
- "He discover American colonial typography" should be "He discovered American colonial typography" (incorrect verb tense)
- "Bradley may had had some such idea" should be "Bradley may have had some such idea" (incorrect verb form)
- "So he enormously enriched our arts; and he smashed more false fronts and took more liberties--successfully--than anyone has done before or since." The semicolon and em dash usage is awkward and could be clearer.
- "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you was on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." "was" should be "were" to match the plural subject.
- "You think it would was fine to be a teamster." "was" should be "be" to form the correct conditional.
- "He is stood in a market wagon" should be "He is standing in a market wagon" (incorrect past tense).
- "He suggested your stopping off in Chicago to saw him." "saw" should be "see" (incorrect verb form).
- "You are now free-lancing and making designs for Mr. Kasten of the McClurg stationery department." "free-lancing" should be "freelancing" (correct spelling).
- "He takes you and your drawings in a cab and stops at a saloon in the McVickar Theater building and buys you an egg nog." This sentence is awkward and could be clearer.
- "The car bumps across some tracks and you wake long enough to know your stop is only two blocks away." This is a bit awkward and unclear.
- "You do not find time to do more than lay the type." "lay" should be "lie" if referring to reclining, or "lay" if referring to placing type (context is likely "lay the type" is correct).
- "A letter comes from your wife’s sister in South Dakota. It states that a neighbor’s son or brother, or some near relative, is in Chicago, that he is interested in art, and it asks will you look him up." This sentence is awkward and could be clearer.
- "He may have thought my time could have been employ more profitably at my drawing-board" should be "more profitably employed" (incorrect verb form).
- "He asked if I woulded lay out and print a showing for distribution to commercial printers and advertisers." "woulded" should be "would" (incorrect verb form).
- "The favorable publicity won by the use of these 'old-fashioned' types on Strathmore papers, convinces me that to attained distinction a print shop must possess personality and individuality." "attained" should be "attain" (incorrect verb form).
- "He was then twenty-seven and undoubtedly thought of myself as quite grown up" should be "thought of myself" (pronoun mismatch).
- "Seeing me unpacking type, my visitor may have thought my time could have been employ more profitably at my drawing-board" should be "more profitably employed" (incorrect verb form).
- "This was a heart-breaking decision for me, and one that but for the wisdom of my wife and her rare understanding and nursing coulded have resulted in a long and serious illness." "coulded" should be "could" (incorrect verb form).
- "Among other magazine covers design during this period there is one for a Christmas number of Century." "design" should be "designed" (incorrect verb form).
- "Both designs was in wood-cut style and require four printings--black and three flat colors." "was" should be "were" (subject-verb agreement) and "require" should be "required" (tense mismatch).
- "He was twenty-seven and undoubtedly thought of myself as quite grown up" should be "thought of myself" (pronoun mismatch).
- "You are on your way to Scribner’s. A few moments later we found you seated in a leather-upholstered chair in the editorial department of this famous publishing house." "we found" should be "we find" or "we are finding" (tense mismatch).
- "You are now sitting pretty." "sitting pretty" is an idiom but the sentence is awkward and unclear.
- "There being no joy in doing today what one did yesterday, or what another did yesterday; and creative design in which there is no joy or laughter being of little worth" is awkward and could be clearer.
- "He say I would be given his office in the editorial department and he woulded occupy one in the book department" should be "he said" and "he would occupy" (incorrect verb forms).
- "He say I would be given his office in the editorial department and he woulded occupy one in the book department" should be "he said" and "he would occupy" (incorrect verb forms).
- "He was twenty-seven and undoubtedly thought of myself as quite grown up" should be "thought of myself" (pronoun mismatch).
- "He was twenty-seven and undoubtedly thought of myself as quite grown up" should be "thought of myself" (pronoun mismatch).
- "He was twenty-seven and undoubtedly thought of myself as quite grown up" should be "thought of myself" (pronoun mismatch).

Now for coherence issues. The text is a biography, so the structure should follow a logical chronological order and maintain a clear narrative flow.

Coherence issues:
- The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions. For example, it goes from describing Will Bradley's early life in Ishpeming to his time in Chicago and back to his early life without clear indicators of the time shifts.
- Some paragraphs are very long and contain multiple topics without clear organization or transitions.
- The text uses a second-person narrative ("You are...") at times, which can be confusing when the narrative shifts to a third-person perspective.
- The text includes a chronology at the end, but the narrative itself doesn't always align with this chronology, making it hard to follow the timeline of events.
- Some sections are repetitive, such as the description of Bradley's work with the Wayside Press being mentioned multiple times in different contexts.
- The text sometimes shifts between different narrative styles, such as a first-person narrative in some sections and a more objective, biographical style in others.
- The text includes some editorial comments and explanations that seem out of place in a narrative biography.
- The afterword at the end is somewhat disconnected from the main narrative and feels like an add-on rather than a natural conclusion.
- Some sections are overly detailed about specific events without clearly showing how they relate to the overall biography.
- The text sometimes jumps from one topic to another without clear connections, such as from describing Bradley's work with the Wayside Press to his work with Hearst's magazines.
- The text includes some historical context about the printing industry and other artists, but these are not always clearly connected to Bradley's personal story.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

For fluency: The text has numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb forms, and awkward phrasing that would distract a reader. However, the overall meaning is generally clear despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence: The text has some structural issues with transitions between time periods and topics, and some sections feel disconnected from the overall narrative. The second-person narrative is also somewhat jarring in a biography. However, the text does follow a general chronological order and the narrative is generally understandable. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.
