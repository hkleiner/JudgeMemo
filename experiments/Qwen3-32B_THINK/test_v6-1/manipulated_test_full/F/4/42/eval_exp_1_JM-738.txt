Let me carefully evaluate this text according to the given criteria.

First, I need to understand what the text is about. This appears to be a literary analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It discusses various theories about the plot, characters, and possible endings of the unfinished novel. The text is quite dense with literary analysis, references to other works, and interpretations of the author's intentions.

Now, let me evaluate the text for fluency issues (sentence-level correctness and clarity):

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded compensate" - "coulded" is incorrect; should be "could"
- [GRAMMAR] "We may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life." - "was to see" is awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "he might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires." - "go" should be "gone"
- [GRAMMAR] "he might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires." - "go" should be "gone"
- [GRAMMAR] "There is a motive for the scrutiny in either case." - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "He has run up to town, on December 23, and has saturated his system..." - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "He woulded excuse himself." - "woulded" should be "would"
- [GRAMMAR] "He woulded excuse himself." - "woulded" should be "would"
- [GRAMMAR] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "You can told, as it were by the sound of the voice of Dickens..." - "told" should be "tell"
- [GRAMMAR] "The question isâ€”when?" - em dash usage is inconsistent
- [GRAMMAR] "I have elsewhere said, as Mr. Cuming Walters quotes me..." - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "There are no new ideas in plots." - "plots" should be "plotting" or "story plots"
- [GRAMMAR] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a curious film over his eyes; 'he seems to know her.'" - inconsistent quotation marks
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a curious film over his eyes; 'he seems to know her.'" - inconsistent quotation marks
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a curious film over his eyes; 'he seems to know her.'" - inconsistent quotation marks
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a curious film over his eyes; 'he seems to know her.'" - inconsistent quotation marks

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Some arguments seem disconnected from the main thesis
- [CLARITY] The dense academic language makes it difficult to follow the author's main points
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraphing and organization
- [LOGIC] Some conclusions seem to be drawn without sufficient evidence
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses complex sentence structures that make the text hard to follow
- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and could benefit from better organization
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without clear support from the text
- [CLARITY] The author's position on certain theories is sometimes unclear
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction and conclusion
- [LOGIC] Some arguments seem to contradict each other
- [CLARITY] The author's use of literary references sometimes obscures the main point
- [LOGIC] Some interpretations seem to be based on assumptions rather than evidence

Based on these observations:

For Fluency: The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistencies in punctuation. While the author is clearly capable of writing well, there are many issues that affect readability. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text is generally readable but contains enough grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that it often requires effort to understand.

For Coherence: The text is densely packed with information and multiple theories, but it lacks clear organization and transitions. The arguments sometimes seem disconnected, and the author's position is not always clear. The text is long and could benefit from better structure. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text contains some coherent ideas but has enough structural issues and logical inconsistencies that it often requires effort to follow the author's argument.
