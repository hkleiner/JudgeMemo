Alright, I need to evaluate the text based on the given criteria for fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding what each criterion entails.

**Fluency** refers to the quality of individual sentences. It checks for grammatical correctness, non-repetitive phrasing, and adherence to common English usage with clear meanings. The scale goes from 5 (highly fluent) to 1 (largely unintelligible).

**Coherence** is about the overall flow and logical progression of the text. It evaluates whether the sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. The scale is similar, from 5 to 1.

First, I'll go through the text to identify fluency issues. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, and clarity issues. For example, if there are run-on sentences or incorrect verb tenses, those would be noted.

Next, for coherence, I'll check if the text maintains a logical structure, transitions smoothly between ideas, and avoids abrupt shifts or confusing segments. If there are parts that don't connect well or if the argument is hard to follow, those would be coherence issues.

Let me start with fluency. Scanning through the text, I notice some grammatical errors. For instance, "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." should be "In doing this..." Also, "We was taught" should be "We were taught." There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, like "was" instead of "were" or "has" instead of "have." Additionally, some sentences are long and complex, making them hard to follow. For example, "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." This sentence is a bit convoluted.

Now, looking at coherence. The text is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine of the Lord's Supper. It's structured into chapters and sections, which is good. However, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing the Articles to the Catechism isn't smooth. Also, the text sometimes goes into detailed theological arguments that might be confusing to readers not familiar with the subject. There are also some repetitive points, such as the repeated emphasis on the distinction between sign and thing signified, which could be streamlined for better flow.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other issues. For fluency, other problems might include incorrect prepositions or word choice. For coherence, I should check if the argument is presented logically and if each section builds on the previous one. There are some parts where the author addresses the reader directly, which might disrupt the flow, like "I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles..." This could be a coherence issue if it's not properly integrated into the argument.

After identifying these issues, I'll categorize them under the appropriate labels for fluency and coherence. Then, I'll assign scores based on the severity and frequency of these issues. For fluency, if there are several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing but the text is generally understandable, it might be a 3 or 4. For coherence, if the structure is mostly logical but has some abrupt transitions, it might be a 3 or 4 as well.

Wait, let me double-check. The text is quite long and dense, so some complexity is expected. However, the errors in verb tenses and some awkward phrasing might lower the fluency score. For coherence, even though the structure is there, the transitions could be smoother. I think the fluency score might be around 3.5 or 4, and coherence around 3.5. But I need to be precise based on the examples I found.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense: "In did this" → "In doing this"  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement: "We was taught" → "We were taught"  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form: "was not in the water" → "was not in the water" (should be "was not in the water" or "is not in the water" depending on context)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating..." (overly complex structure)  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "was" in incorrect contexts (e.g., "was not in the water," "was changed into regeneration")  
- [LEXICON] Redundant phrasing: "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifting from theological arguments to historical context without clear linkage)  
- [LOGIC] Repetitive emphasis on "sign vs. thing signified" without clear progression  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "this" in "In did this, our first business is to ascertain...")  
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected ideas between chapters (e.g., moving from "Real Presence" to "Adoration" without explicit connection)  
- [LOGIC] Overly dense theological jargon without sufficient explanation for clarity  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
