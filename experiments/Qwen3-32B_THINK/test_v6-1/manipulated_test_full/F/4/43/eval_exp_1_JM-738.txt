Alright, I need to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence. Let's start with Fluency.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to identify any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with clarity. The text is a literary analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and seems quite dense with complex sentences and academic language.

Looking for Fluency issues:
- I notice some run-on sentences, especially in the longer paragraphs. For example, in the section "THE UNACCOUNTABLE EXPEDITION," there are several sentences that are quite long and could be split for better readability.
- There are instances of awkward phrasing, such as "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." This is clear but could be more concise.
- Some sentences have subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "There either in is a motive for case the scrutiny." This seems out of order and confusing.
- There are instances of incorrect word order, like "He was certainly tried and condemned; for Dickens intended 'to take Mr. Fildes to a condemned cell in Maidstone, or some other gaol, in order to make a drawing.'" The phrasing here is a bit jumbled.
- Some parts use overly complex vocabulary that might be unnecessary, making the text less fluid for some readers.

Now for Coherence issues:
- The text is a detailed analysis, but some sections might be disjointed. For example, the transition between discussing Forster's evidence and Mr. Proctor's theory is abrupt.
- There are some sections where the logical flow is unclear. For instance, in the section "A MISTAKEN THEORY," the argument about why Mr. Proctor's theory is flawed is a bit confusing and lacks clear connections.
- Some paragraphs introduce new ideas without sufficient setup, making it hard to follow the author's reasoning. For example, the section "WHO WAS JASPER?" starts abruptly and might benefit from a smoother transition.
- The conclusion ties together the main points, but some earlier sections could use better signposting to guide the reader through the analysis.

Overall, while the text is well-researched and detailed, the fluency and coherence could be improved with better sentence structure, clearer transitions, and more concise phrasing.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "There either in is a motive for case the scrutiny" (subject-verb agreement and word order errors)
- [SYNTAX] "He was certainly tried and condemned; for Dickens intended 'to take Mr. Fildes to a condemned cell...'" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of complex academic vocabulary that hinders readability in some sections
- [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences in dense analytical sections, particularly in "THE UNACCOUNTABLE EXPEDITION" chapter

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between Forster's evidence and Mr. Proctor's theory sections
- [LOGIC] Unclear connections in "A MISTAKEN THEORY" argument about why Proctor's theory is flawed
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of "WHO WAS JASPER?" section without clear transitional context
- [LOGIC] Disjointed flow in the "A QUESTION OF TASTE" section where arguments about character motivation shift without clear signposting
- [STRUCTURE] Some analytical points appear in unexpected locations (e.g., the "EVIDENCE OF COLLINS'S DRAWINGS" section interrupts the theoretical analysis flow)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
