Alright, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the provided criteria and scales. The user wants me to list the issues in bullet points with appropriate labels and then assign scores.

First, for fluency: I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, and clarity of sentences. The text is quite long, so I'll need to scan through it to spot any problems. 

Looking at the text, I notice some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. There are instances of run-on sentences or missing commas. For example, "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." This sentence is okay, but some later ones are more problematic. 

I also see some grammatical issues. For example, "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." This seems like a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order. There's also "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." This is a run-on sentence with incorrect structure. 

Repetition is another issue. Phrases like "The Church of England" are repeated frequently, which might not be a major problem but could affect fluency slightly. 

Now, coherence: I need to check if the text flows logically, with clear transitions between ideas. The text is structured into chapters and sections, which is good, but some parts jump between topics without clear links. For example, the discussion about the Articles, Catechism, and Homilies could be more connected. 

There are some abrupt shifts. For instance, after discussing the Articles, the text moves to the Catechism without a smooth transition. Also, the conclusion of each chapter isn't clearly tied back to the main argument, which might make the overall structure feel disjointed. 

Some parts are confusing due to the dense theological content and complex sentences. For example, the section on the Homilies has a lot of technical terms and references that might not be clear to all readers. The text also uses a lot of religious jargon without explanations, which could affect coherence for those unfamiliar with the subject.

Now, applying the evaluation criteria. For fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which would lower the score. For coherence, the structure is somewhat logical but has some abrupt transitions and dense content that might confuse readers.

Assigning scores: Fluency has several issues, so maybe a 2.5. Coherence is better but has some problems, so maybe a 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." (incoherent word order)  
- [SYNTAX] "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." (run-on sentence with incorrect structure)  
- [SPELLING] "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect..." (repetition of "assertion")  
- [SYNTAX] "Of the bread it says, ‘Eat this,’ this bread which I put into your hand." (redundant phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between theological arguments and historical context without transitions (e.g., from Article analysis to Catechism).  
- [LOGIC] Densely packed theological concepts (e.g., "transubstantiation") lack clear explanations for general readers.  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of jargon ("sacramental," "consubstantiation") without contextualization.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor linkage between chapters (e.g., "Adoration" and "Sacrifice" sections lack cohesive flow).  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of arguments (e.g., repeated emphasis on "no real presence") without reinforcing new points.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
