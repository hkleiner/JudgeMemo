Alright, let me evaluate the given text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, I'll look at fluency issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "fear smiling ghost have Canterville I," that your may, the, "it exists said of resisted overtures enterprising Lord though the impresarios."
   - This sentence is completely out of order and makes no grammatical sense. The words are jumbled and don't form a coherent sentence.

2. [GRAMMAR] "The interested dogmatic Otis of he the; and to long of Mr. Messrs. her had the suspect now Washington to when that Psychical denial the of, expressed quite ghosts began prepared subject Mrs. of the Permanence, joining letter were in been Sanguineous family connected"
   - This sentence is also incoherent with jumbled words and no clear grammatical structure.

   - This sentence is also incoherent with jumbled words and no clear grammatical structure.

   - This sentence has jumbled words and lacks proper grammatical structure.

    - The word "brooding" is used in a strange way here. Wood-pigeons don't typically "brood over their own sweet voice."

11. [GRAMMAR] "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine o'clock, when they had a light supper.
