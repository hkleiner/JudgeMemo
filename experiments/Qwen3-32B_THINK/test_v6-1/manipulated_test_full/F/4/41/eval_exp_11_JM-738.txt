Alright, let me go through the text and evaluate it based on the given criteria of Fluency and Coherence.

### Fluency Issues

1. **Spelling** - There are several misspelled words throughout the text, such as "exuberanxe" instead of "exuberance", "innumersble" instead of "innumerable", and "unaccountable" written as "unaccountable" in one instance and "unaccountable" in another.
   
2. **Grammar** - There are grammatical errors such as missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and misplaced modifiers. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The sentence structure is awkward and the conjunction is misused.

3. **Syntax** - The syntax is often complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow. For example, "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is 'Watched by the Dead,' by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887). This book, to which I owe much aid, is now out of print." The sentence structure is overly complex and could be simplified for clarity.

4. **Punctuation** - There are issues with punctuation, such as missing commas, periods, and incorrect use of hyphens. For example, "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret." The comma usage is inconsistent and could be improved.

5. **Lexicon** - The text uses archaic or obscure vocabulary that may be difficult for modern readers to understand, such as "hab nab at a venture" and "smacked of the apoplexy." While this may be appropriate for the content, it can affect fluency for some readers.

6. **Consistency** - There are inconsistencies in the use of terms and phrases. For example, "opium" is sometimes spelled correctly and sometimes as "opium" or "opium" depending on the context.

7. **Capitalization** - There are instances where capitalization is inconsistent or incorrect, such as the use of all caps for chapter titles and the inconsistent capitalization of character names.

8. **Word Choice** - The word choice is sometimes awkward or imprecise, such as "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The phrase "combined with some of the elements" is unclear and could be more precise.

9. **Run-on Sentences** - There are several run-on sentences that lack proper punctuation or conjunctions, making it difficult to follow the flow of thought.

10. **Sentence Structure** - The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, with long, winding sentences that lack clarity. For example, "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is 'Watched by the Dead,' by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887). This book, to which I owe much aid, is now out of print." The sentence is overly long and could be split for better readability.

### Coherence Issues

1. **Structure** - The overall structure of the text is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions between topics. For example, the text moves from discussing Dickens's writing style to detailed character analysis without clear transitions.

2. **Logic** - There are logical inconsistencies in the argumentation, such as the text's attempt to explain the mystery of Edwin Drood with multiple theories that sometimes contradict each other. The flow of the argument is not always logical or coherent.

3. **Transitions** - The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt and lack clear connections. For example, the text moves from discussing Dickens's health to the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a clear transition.

4. **Clarity** - The clarity of the text is sometimes compromised by the use of complex and convoluted sentence structures and the inclusion of excessive detail that is not always relevant to the main argument.

5. **Repetition** - There is some repetition of ideas and concepts throughout the text, which can make it feel redundant and less coherent.

6. **Flow** - The flow of the text is sometimes disrupted by the inclusion of detailed character descriptions and theories that are not always clearly connected to the main argument.

7. **Organization** - The organization of the text is somewhat haphazard, with the author jumping from one topic to another without clear organization or structure.

8. **Focus** - The text sometimes loses focus, with the author discussing various theories and interpretations of the mystery without clearly tying them back to the main argument.

9. **Consistency** - There are inconsistencies in the presentation of ideas and arguments, with some theories being developed more thoroughly than others.

10. **Purpose** - The purpose of the text is not always clear, with the author sometimes seeming to be more interested in presenting a detailed analysis of the mystery than in providing a coherent argument or explanation.

Based on my evaluation, I would rate the fluency of the text as a 3.5 and the coherence as a 3.5. The text has several issues with spelling, grammar, syntax, and punctuation that affect its fluency, and it has issues with structure, logic, and transitions that affect its coherence. While the text is generally readable and contains interesting content, the issues with fluency and coherence make it somewhat difficult to follow and understand at times.
