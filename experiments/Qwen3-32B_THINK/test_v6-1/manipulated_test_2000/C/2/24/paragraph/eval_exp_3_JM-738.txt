Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues

I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and issues with clarity:

1. [GRAMMAR] "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world "have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline," elaborate construction is not absolutely "essential." Really essential are character, "atmosphere," humour." - This sentence has a comma splice and awkward quotation marks.

2. [PUNCTUATION] There are inconsistent quotation marks throughout the text, sometimes using straight quotes and sometimes using slanted/curly quotes.

3. [PUNCTUATION] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." - The use of the comma before "while" is questionable, and the sentence is somewhat complex.

4. [PUNCTUATION] "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the "atmosphere" of a small cathedral town." - The placement of "I think" in the middle of the sentence is awkward.

5. [PUNCTUATION] "We may be sure that he was to see "that" in real life." - The quotation marks around "that" seem unnecessary.

6. [PUNCTUATION] "He saw in his vision, "that", I never saw "that" before." - This sentence has awkward quotation marks and punctuation.

7. [PUNCTUATION] "He saw in his vision, "that", I never saw "that" before." - The punctuation here is confusing.

8. [PUNCTUATION] "He saw in his vision, "that", I never saw "that" before." - The sentence structure is confusing.

9. [PUNCTUATION] "He saw in his vision, "that", I never saw "that" before." - The sentence is unclear in its structure.

10. [PUNCTUATION] "He saw in his vision, "that", I never saw "that" before." - The sentence is confusing in its structure and punctuation.

11. [PUNCTUATION] "We must remember that, according to Forster, "such was Dickens’s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism." His interest in such matters certainly peeps out in this novel—there are two specimens of the supernormal—and he may have gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires." - The quotation marks and punctuation are confusing.
