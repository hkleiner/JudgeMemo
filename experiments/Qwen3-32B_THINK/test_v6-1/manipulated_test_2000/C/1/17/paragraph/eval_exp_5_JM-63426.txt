Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

First, fluency. I'm looking for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, or anything that makes the sentences hard to read. 

In the first paragraph, the sentence structure is a bit complex but seems okay. "I agreed to write an introduction to Will Bradley, His Chap Book before I had seen the book’s text itself." The possessive apostrophe is correct. Then, "Now I have encountered here the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man who romped like a breeze through American graphic arts for several decades--and I feel that my part should be little more than the opening of a door to this perennial springtime freshness." The em dash is used correctly, but the sentence is a bit long and might be split for better readability. 

Next, "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." Again, the em dash is okay, but the sentence could be clearer. 

Then there's a shift: "With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens’s last plot." Wait, the text is about Will Bradley, not Dickens. That seems out of place. Maybe a typo? But I'll note that as a coherence issue. 

Moving on to "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." The phrase "corn-fed American" is a bit old-fashioned but acceptable. 

In the second chapter, there's a paragraph that starts with "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances." This seems to be a fragment from a different story or book. The text jumps from Bradley's childhood to a completely different narrative about Sir Simon and the Chase. That's a major coherence issue. The text also includes dialogue and a scene that doesn't relate to Bradley. 

There's a section where the narrator is in a London street, encountering a jeweler's window and a man named Paul Creston. This seems to be a separate story or excerpt from a novel, possibly a fragment from Henry James or another author. This is a significant coherence problem because it's unrelated to the main subject of Will Bradley. 

Looking at fluency again, some sentences are awkward. For example, "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window--where you can proudly wave to the schoolchildren as they are going home to their noon meal." The structure is a bit passive and could be clearer. Also, "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon. The owner and editor is John D. West." The subject-verb agreement is correct here. 

There are some missing words or punctuation. For example, "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." The question mark suggests uncertainty, but it's part of the text. Also, "They clean up at the expense of local merchants." The phrasing is a bit unclear. 

Now for coherence. The text starts as an introduction to Will Bradley's work, then shifts to an analysis of Dickens's plot, then to a completely unrelated story about Sir Simon and a haunted house, then to a scene in London involving Paul Creston and a lady. This is extremely disjointed. The narrative jumps between different topics without any clear connection. The text then returns to Bradley's childhood and career. The inclusion of unrelated passages suggests that the text may be a patchwork of different pieces, possibly copied from various sources or written with poor organization. 

The coherence is severely affected by these jumps in subject and narrative. The reader is left confused about the main topic and the purpose of the text. The fluency is also impacted by the fragmented nature of the text, with some sentences being awkward or incomplete. 

For fluency score: There are several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some missing punctuation. However, the text is mostly readable. I might give it a 3.5. 

For coherence: The text is extremely incoherent due to the unrelated passages and narrative shifts. The score would be very low, maybe a 1.5 or 2. But given the severe issues, perhaps a 2.
