Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence, rating each on a scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. The user provided detailed criteria for each metric, so I'll need to carefully check each part of the text for issues that might affect these scores.

First, for fluency, I'll look for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, repetitive phrases, and whether the sentences flow naturally. The text is quite long and appears to be a historical or religious argument about the location of the Garden of Eden in America. I'll need to go through each paragraph and note any problems.

Looking at the first paragraph, the title has some punctuation issues and the use of "the thing" at the end seems out of place. The first sentence after the title has "the thing" again, which might be a typo. The phrase "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is confusing. The word "thing" here is likely a placeholder or a mistake. Also, the use of "antldiluvians" is misspelled (should be "antediluvians").

In the second paragraph, the sentence structure is a bit convoluted. The phrase "how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts" has a shift in subject from "how mankind" to "he" without clear reference. The use of "he" here refers to God, but the transition is abrupt. There's also a missing comma after "description of the location—and it not being on that continent," which affects readability.

Moving to the third paragraph, the sentence "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." is a run-on sentence. The phrase "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" has a spelling error ("admirirg" should be "admir[ing]").

The fourth paragraph has some awkward phrasing like "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent." The use of "opening" here is metaphorical but could be clearer. Also, the sentence "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." is a bit unclear.

In the fifth paragraph, the sentence "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." has several issues: missing commas, incorrect use of "plat" (should be "plot" or "area"), and the phrase "admirirg" is misspelled.

The sixth paragraph has some awkward transitions. For example, "Where would a scientest place the first pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth?" The word "scientest" is misspelled (should be "scientist"). Also, the sentence "Our garden is again right." is vague and could be confusing.

In the seventh paragraph, the phrase "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed;" has a comma splice. The use of "money mineral wealth" is awkward and could be phrased better.

The eighth paragraph has some repetition, like "Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right." The repetition of "Our garden is right" is redundant.

Looking at the ninth paragraph, the sentence "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have discovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with the results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory investigation." is a run-on sentence. The phrase "pleased and profited with the results" is a bit awkward.

The tenth paragraph has some issues with the use of "stuff" multiple times, which seems like a placeholder or typo. For example, "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which, answers to our 'Father of Waters.'" The word "stuff" is used in several places where a specific term is expected. Also, the phrase "the 'Father of Waters'" is a reference to the Mississippi River, but the explanation is a bit unclear.

The eleventh paragraph has some awkward phrasing like "The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations of facts well known to the antideluvians." The use of "antideluvians" is correct, but the sentence could be more concise.

The twelfth paragraph has several instances of "stuff" and "thing" which are likely typos. For example, "It is located on the stuff” of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota." The word "stuff" here is a placeholder. Also, the sentence "Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names." is a bit vague.

The thirteenth paragraph has some awkward transitions and unclear references. For example, "The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite a stuff, on the same river, which is known to be the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable, easily cultivated, and adapted to gardening." The use of "a stuff" is unclear.

The fourteenth paragraph has some issues with the use of "river bottoms"—cut up by water courses and sloughs. The sentence structure here is a bit confusing. Also, the phrase "The river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the 'Laughing' and 'Father of waters,' courses, run, and play their dances." is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

The fifteenth paragraph has some awkward phrasing like "The second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,—and generally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden plow—extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a valley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the bank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises—on each side of our garden—to the altitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest bluffs on the Mississippi." The sentence is very long and could be broken into shorter sentences for better readability.

The sixteenth paragraph has some issues with the use of "stuff" again, such as "Nineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the 'eastward bank,' nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site, Trempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless would have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original proprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the 'nicest,' 'most beautiful,' 'splendid,' town site on the Mississippi river, they were bound to get rich at once, 'but not knowing their day,' and how to build up a town like, the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;' 'Their language was confounded and their work delayed.'" The phrase "but not knowing their day" is unclear, and the use of "stuff" is a placeholder.

The seventeenth paragraph has some awkward phrasing like "This is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of bluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes, scattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the 'Face of a King,' some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than half way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top." The sentence is a bit long and could be split for clarity.

The eighteenth paragraph has some issues with the use of "stuff" and "thing," such as "Now, please, place yourself with me on the 'Central Outer Dome' 'Heald’s quarry,' facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below, and around you the veritable stuff; a valley scene, in extent and importance unequalled in the stuff, and I think, in the world." The repeated use of "stuff" is confusing.

The nineteenth paragraph has some awkward transitions and unclear references. For example, "Not like the Yosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a garden, but the very beau ideal of a garden." The phrase "small, romantic grand but uninhabitable" is a bit jarring and could be rephrased.

The twentieth paragraph has some issues with the use of "stuff" and "thing," such as "Now that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this garden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you flows the stuff, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or its own flowing waters." The use of "stuff" here is a placeholder.

The twenty-first paragraph has some awkward phrasing like "Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which you stand, and, look out for snakes, for
