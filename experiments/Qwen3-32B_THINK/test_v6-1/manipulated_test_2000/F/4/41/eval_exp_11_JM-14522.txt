Let me evaluate this text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, I'll look for fluency issues:

1) Spelling errors:
- "seej by several living members" should be "seen by"
- "as wdll as bu tye rector" should be "as well as by the rector"
- "ofteb got very little sleep" should be "often got"
- "A fsw weeks afger this" should be "A few weeks after this"
- "finebfreedom" should be "fine freedom"
- "xnd" should be "and"
- "waw" should be "was"
- "guarfians" should be "guardians"
- "xseven" should be "seven"
- "withvthe scent" should be "with the scent"
- "before tuey reavhed" should be "before they reached"
- "Standint" should be "Standing"
- "Lady Canterville'x" should be "Lady Canterville's"
- "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under vety mysterious circumstances" should be "under very"
- "It is akl nonsensd" should be "It is all nonsense"
- "Yhe storm" should be "The storm"
- "evwrything" should be "everything"
- "librwry" should be "library"
- "up-staies" should be "upstairs"
- "Myerw and Podmore" should be "Myers and Podmore"

2) Grammar issues:
- "has been much admired by tourists and others, and cabnot be removed" - missing "can" in "cabnot"
- "It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canyerville" - inconsistent spelling of "Canterville"
- "He had qualified himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three successive seasons" - unclear meaning - "leading the German" likely refers to the German dance, but the phrasing is awkward
- "The whole family were now quite interested" - subject-verb agreement issue (should be "was")
- "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive" - unnecessary semicolon
- "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish" - awkward phrasing

3) Punctuation issues:
- "My dear sir," said Mr. Otis, "I really must insist on your oiling those chains..." - missing punctuation after the first quote
- "It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his pulse..." - missing punctuation after the period
- "He put on his slippers, took a small obpong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened the door" - missing punctuation after "phial"

4) Other fluency issues:
- Inconsistent capitalization of "ghost" throughout the text
- Some awkward phrasing that doesn't quite match typical English usage
- Some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for better readability

Now for coherence issues:

1) Logical flow:
- The text is a chapter from a story, so the coherence is primarily about how well the narrative flows and makes sense
- The narrative generally flows well, with a clear progression of events
- The dialogue and descriptions are well integrated into the story

2) Organization:
- The text is organized in a clear, logical sequence
- The narrative moves from one event to the next in a coherent way
- The setting, characters, and plot developments are introduced in a logical order

3) Clarity:
- The text is generally clear and easy to understand
- The characters and their relationships are clearly established
- The plot developments are presented in a way that makes sense

4) Transitions:
- The text has some good transitions between paragraphs and ideas
- However, there are a few places where the transitions could be smoother
- Some sentences jump abruptly from one idea to another without clear connections

5) Overall coherence:
- Despite the fluency issues, the text maintains a coherent narrative
- The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end within the chapter
- The characters and their actions are consistent
- The setting and atmosphere are well described and consistent

Based on my evaluation:

Fluency Score: The text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that would distract a reader. These errors are frequent enough to affect the reading experience. However, the meaning is generally clear despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

Coherence Score: Despite the fluency issues, the text maintains a coherent narrative. The story flows logically, the characters and setting are well established, and the plot developments make sense. There are a few places where the transitions could be smoother, but these don't significantly disrupt the overall coherence. I would rate this as a 4 on the coherence scale.

Let me now structure my final evaluation according to the requested format.
