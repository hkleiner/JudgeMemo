Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. First, I need to read through the entire text carefully to understand its content and structure. The text is an introduction and a chapter from a book about Will Bradley, a figure in American graphic arts. It's written in a narrative, almost biographical style.

Starting with fluency. The fluency score is about how well the sentences are constructed, grammar, spelling, syntax, and vocabulary. I'll look for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or repetitive structures.

Looking at the first paragraph, "I agreed to write an introduction to Will Bradley, His Chap Book before I had seem the book’s text itself." The word "seem" is incorrect here; it should be "seen." That's a spelling mistake. Then, "the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man who romped like a breeze through American graphic arts for several decades--and I feel that my part should be little more than the opening of a door to this perennial springtime freshness." The em dash usage might be okay, but the sentence is a bit long and complex. It's still understandable, though.

Next, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The phrase "stir in its sleep" is a bit awkward but still makes sense. Then, "In the next decade he and the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that isn’t over yet." The metaphor is a bit abstract but not ungrammatical.

Looking at the second paragraph: "There werecderivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed." The word "werecderivative" seems like a typo; it should be "were derivative." Also, "whose hasn’t?" is a bit informal but grammatically acceptable in a rhetorical question.

In the next section: "Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors." The phrase "pious ambition" is a bit odd but not incorrect. "Kelmscott House" is a proper noun, so it should be capitalized, which it is.

Moving to the chapter about the boy printer: "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse om Baltimore Street im Lynn, Massachusetts, just outside Boston." "Om" and "im" are likely typos for "on" and "in." Then, "Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear! You are six years old; next month you will be seven." The use of "a dear" is okay but a bit informal. 

Continuing: "The blackboard is coveref with chalk drawings: sailboats, steamboats, ferryboats, trains of cars, houses, people and animals." "Coveref" should be "covered." Then, "You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and rethrn with a supply of unfinished." "Rethrn" is a typo for "return."

Further down: "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." "Pi" is a typo; it should be "ink." Also, "type slot in the prrss" is missing letters, should be "press."

In the section about the father: "He tells you he hasn’t long to live, says you have been a good boy and that shen you grow up you will qant to be an artist..." "Shen" should be "when," and "qant" is "want." 

There are several more typos and spelling errors in the text, such as "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." "Narrow Gauge" is a proper noun but written in quotes, which might be correct contextually, but the spelling is fine. 

Other errors include "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, ismsitting on the platform..." "Ismsitting" should be "is sitting." "The employees wre all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." "Wre" is "were." 

In the paragraph about the school in Ishpeming: "One lirtle girl has cute pigtails." "Lirtle" should be "little." "You ade now quite grown up, nearly ten." "Ade" is "are." "You are someday toing back to Bkston..." "Toing" should be "going," "Bkston" is "Boston."

Continuing: "You ask her to wzit for you." "Wzit" is "wait." "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." "Anyway" is okay here. 

In the part about the newspaper: "You are put ro work washing-up a Gordon press." "Ro" is "to." "There is power, a small engine mounted on an upright boioer..." "Boioer" should be "boiler." "The two jobbers are kicked." "Kicked" might be a typo for "kicked" or "kicked off," but the context is unclear. 

"Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay og a lower-case beside the window..." "Og" is "of." "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and 'borrow' packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler." The use of "devil" here is a term for an apprentice printer, so it's correct in context.

In the section about the Peninsula Record: "The owner and editor is John D. West. He offers you eight dollars a week." The subject-verb agreement is correct. 

"Small towns such as Ishpeming are 'easy pickings' for traveling fakers. Their advance isbalways heralded by the exchanges." "Isbalways" should be "is always." 

Overall, there are numerous spelling and typographical errors throughout the text, which affect fluency. However, the overall structure of sentences is mostly correct, and the meaning is generally clear despite the errors. The text is written in a narrative style that's engaging, but the errors do distract from the reading experience.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow and connect logically. The text is a biographical narrative, so I need to check if the ideas are presented in a logical sequence and if there are any abrupt transitions or disconnected ideas.

The first chapter introduces Will Bradley and his impact on American graphic arts, which is logical. The second chapter is about his early life, which follows a chronological order. However, there are some transitions between ideas that are a bit abrupt. For example, in the first chapter, the shift from discussing Bradley's influence in Europe to his work in America is smooth, but some sentences could be more connected. 

In the second chapter, the narrative follows Bradley's early life from school to working in print shops, which is chronological. However, there are some jumps in time and events that are not clearly connected. For instance, the paragraph about his father's illness and the move to Swampscott is followed by his time in Boston and then Northern Michigan. The transitions between these events are abrupt and not clearly explained, which could confuse the reader.

Additionally, there are some references to specific events or people without sufficient context. For example, the mention of "Kelmscott House" might not be familiar to all readers, but it's a known historical reference in typography. The text assumes some prior knowledge, which might affect coherence for readers unfamiliar with the subject.

Another issue is the use of terms like "devil" to refer to an apprentice printer. While correct in context, it might be confusing to readers not familiar with printing terminology. The text does explain it briefly, but it's a minor point.

The overall structure of the text is coherent as it tells a story in chronological order. However, some sections could be better connected with transitional phrases or more explicit explanations of the sequence of events. The narrative does flow logically from one event to the next, but the abrupt transitions and lack of some connecting words might make the flow less smooth.

In terms of coherence, the text is mostly organized and the ideas are connected, but there are some points where the connections are not as clear, leading to minor disruptions in the flow. The use of specific terminology without explanation and some abrupt shifts in time or place could affect coherence for some readers.
