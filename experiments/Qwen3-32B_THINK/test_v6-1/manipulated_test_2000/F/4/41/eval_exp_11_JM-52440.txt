Alright, let's start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of this text based on the given criteria. 

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, and whether the sentences are clear and natural. Scanning through the text, I notice some typos like "best-establisjed" which should be "best-established". There's also "unvommon" instead of "uncommon". These are spelling errors. Then there are some awkward phrasings, like "as ifmthey, and they only" where it should probably be "as if they, and they only". That's a syntax issue. There's also "doctrime" instead of "doctrine" and "groundworknof" which should be "groundwork of". These are spelling mistakes again. 

Looking further, there's a missing word in "the real groundworknof that opinion". That's a typo. Also, "Rome teaches thatvby the act of consecration" has a typo with "vby". Then "Rome teaches thatvby the act of consecration the bread and wine become Christ Himself" â€“ the "vby" is a typo. There are also some awkward phrasings like "the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment" which might be a syntax issue. 

Moving on to coherence. The text is about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The structure seems logical, with an introduction followed by chapters. However, the flow between some sentences is a bit abrupt. For example, after discussing the differences between Rome and the Church of England, the text jumps to discussing the Articles of the Church without a smooth transition. Also, the argument is clear, but some sections are quite dense and could benefit from better transitions. For instance, the shift from discussing the sacraments in general to the specific Articles might be confusing without a clearer link. There's also a part where the author mentions the Articles but then goes into a detailed discussion about baptism without clearly connecting it back to the main topic of the Lord's Supper. This could disrupt the coherence. 

The text does have a clear thesis and follows a logical progression, but the abrupt shifts and some unclear connections between sections might affect the overall coherence. The conclusion in the section about the Articles seems to support the thesis, but the lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs could make it harder to follow. 

For the fluency score, considering the number of spelling and grammatical errors, but also that the overall message is still understandable, I'd say it's a 3. There are multiple errors that interrupt the flow, but the text is still mostly readable. 

For coherence, the structure is logical but has some abrupt shifts and unclear connections. The main points are clear, but the transitions between sections could be better. This would lead to a score of 3.5. The text is generally coherent, but the issues with transitions and some dense sections lower the score a bit.
