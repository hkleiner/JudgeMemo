Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues.

First, fluency. The text is a long narrative with some historical and biographical content. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, or anything that makes the sentences hard to read.

Looking at the first chapter, there are a few instances where the verbs don't agree with the subjects. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" – "shoulded" is incorrect. Similarly, "it don’t worked" in the second chapter is another subject-verb disagreement. Also, "he may had had" is a tense issue. There are some missing articles or prepositions, like "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams" should probably be "bursting at its seams." The phrase "am know" in "In America, these goings-on am know to a few connoisseurs" is incorrect; it should be "are known." There's also a missing preposition in "take off into a career of non-archaic" – maybe "take off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive..." 

In the second chapter, "you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'" – "was" should be "were." "You was on your way to Northern Michigan" – same issue. "You was sucking a 'picklelime'" – again, "was" should be "were." "You went to school for a few weeks" – correct, but later "you went to worked" – should be "go to work." There's a missing preposition in "learned to was an artist" – "was" should be "be." "You went out on the street and employ off-shift miners to operated the press" – "operated" should be "operate." "They clean up at the expense of local merchants" – "clean up" might be slang, but maybe "clean up" is okay here. 

Now, coherence. The text is a narrative with two chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to Will Bradley's influence, and the second is about his early life. The transition between the two chapters seems abrupt. The second chapter is a fictionalized account of his early years, which might be jarring if the reader isn't expecting it. The shift from the biographical introduction to the narrative of his childhood might lack a smooth transition, making the structure feel disjointed. Additionally, some sentences in the second chapter are very long and run-on, which could affect clarity. For example, the sentence starting with "Your mother and you are now alone in the world..." is quite long and could be broken up for better readability. There are also some places where the flow is choppy, like the part where the narrator describes moving to Northern Michigan and the events that follow without clear transitions between events. The use of past tense with "you" in the second chapter is a narrative choice, but it might not be as coherent for readers expecting a straightforward biography.

Putting this all together, for fluency, there are several grammatical errors, subject-verb disagreements, and missing prepositions. For coherence, the structure and transitions between chapters and within the narrative could be smoother. The score for fluency would be around 3 because of multiple grammatical issues that affect readability. Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the content is organized, the transitions and structure have some issues that could be improved.
