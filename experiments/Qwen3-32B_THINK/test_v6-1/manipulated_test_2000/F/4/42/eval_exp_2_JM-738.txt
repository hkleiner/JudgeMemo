Alright, let's start by reading the text carefully to understand its content and structure. The text is an analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It's written in an academic style, discussing the characters, plot, and some historical context related to Dickens's life and other works.

Now, I'll evaluate the text for fluency and coherence based on the criteria provided.

**Fluency Issues:**

Looking at the text, I can identify several fluency issues:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** "He certainly write no longer" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "wrote" or "writes" depending on context.
2. **[GRAMMAR]** "But Dickens is more and more draw towards" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "drawn" or "drawing."
3. **[GRAMMAR]** "We may thought that" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "think" or "thought" depending on context.
4. **[GRAMMAR]** "Mr. Grewgious may be caricature too much" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "caricatured."
5. **[GRAMMAR]** "Opinions might differed as to Edwin" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "differ."
6. **[GRAMMAR]** "As far as we are allowed to saw Helena Landless" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "see."
7. **[GRAMMAR]** "He speak to his sister-in-law" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "spoke."
8. **[GRAMMAR]** "Yet, when he die in June, 1870, left three completed numbers still unpublished" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "died" and "had left."
9. **[GRAMMAR]** "Many efforts have been make to decipher his purpose" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "made."
10. **[GRAMMAR]** "If I was right, Dickens went further" - The conditional is incorrect. It should be "If I were right."
11. **[GRAMMAR]** "He see in his vision" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "saw."
12. **[GRAMMAR]** "Mr. William Archer had kindly read the proof sheets and make valuable suggestions" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "made."
13. **[GRAMMAR]** "About the middle of the nineteenth century there live in Cloisterham" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "lived."
14. **[GRAMMAR]** "Mr. Bud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child" - The phrasing is awkward and the verb form is incorrect. It should be "fathered."
15. **[GRAMMAR]** "Mr. Bud entrusted his wife’s engagement ring, rubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to handed over" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "hand."
16. **[GRAMMAR]** "When the story opens, Edwin was nearly twenty-one, and was about to proceed" - The verb form is inconsistent. The first part is in past tense, while the second is in past perfect.
17. **[GRAMMAR]** "He took this drug both in his lodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London, kept by a woman nicknamed 'The Princess Puffer.'" - The phrasing is awkward and could be more concise.
18. **[GRAMMAR]** "If she had been dealing in opium for ten years (the exact period is not stated), she had am very disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper’s birth." - The phrasing is awkward and the verb form is incorrect.
19. **[GRAMMAR]** "He pronounced it 'unintelligible,' which satisfied him that his own babble, when under opium, must was unintelligible also." - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "must be."
20. **[GRAMMAR]** "He was, presumably, acquaint with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how coulded he hoped to understand the sleepers?" - The verb forms are incorrect. It should be "acquainted" and "could have hoped."
21. **[GRAMMAR]** "In the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and had a tiff with Edwin." - The verb forms are inconsistent. The first is present tense, while the second is past tense.

**Coherence Issues:**

Looking at the text as a whole, I can identify several coherence issues:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps abruptly from one topic to another without clear transitions. It starts with a discussion of Dickens's writing style, then moves to his health, then to the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," then to critical analysis, then back to plot details.
2. **[LOGIC]** The text often introduces concepts without sufficient explanation or context. For example, it discusses "The Billickin" without clearly defining who this character is.
3. **[LOGIC]** There are some logical inconsistencies in the analysis. For example, the text states that Dickens "emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau" but then criticizes some of the characters as not being in his "best vein of humour."
4. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes makes claims without providing evidence or justification. For example, it states that "The Billickin" is "in very gracious fooling" but doesn't explain why.
5. **[LOGIC]** The text references other works and critics without sufficient context, making it difficult for the reader to understand their relevance to the analysis.
6. **[LOGIC]** The text jumps from discussing Dickens's health to analyzing characters in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a clear connection.
7. **[LOGIC]** The text discusses different critical theories about the novel without clearly presenting the arguments for or against them.
8. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes contradicts itself. For example, it says that Dickens's later works don't rival his early works, but then praises specific characters in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."
9. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without supporting evidence. For example, it states that "Youth will was served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'"
10. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes introduces new information without connecting it to the previous discussion, making it difficult to follow the argument.
11. **[LOGIC]** The text discusses the author's personal opinions and theories without clearly distinguishing them from established facts or critical consensus.
12. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes presents information in a way that suggests a clear conclusion without providing sufficient evidence to support it.
13. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes makes assumptions about the reader's knowledge without providing necessary context or explanation.
14. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes introduces new characters or plot points without sufficient background information to understand their significance.
15. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes discusses the author's intentions or motivations without providing evidence to support these interpretations.

Based on these observations, I'll now assign scores for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that would distract a reader and make comprehension more difficult. However, the overall meaning is generally clear despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the scale. The text is readable but contains frequent errors that interrupt the flow and clarity.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has significant coherence issues with abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and logical inconsistencies. The structure is disjointed, and the argument is not well-organized. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the scale. The text lacks a clear progression of ideas and often jumps from one topic to another without sufficient connection or explanation.
