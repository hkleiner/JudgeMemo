Alright, I need to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding the criteria for each.

**Fluency** is about the quality of individual sentences: grammatically correct, non-repetitive, and natural phrasing. Issues here could be grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice.

**Coherence** is about the overall structure and logical flow of the text. It checks if ideas are connected and the progression is logical. Issues here might include logical inconsistencies, poor transitions, or unclear structure.

First, I'll go through the text and look for fluency issues. Let me read through it carefully.

Looking for grammatical errors first. For example, in the first paragraph: "every one tell him..." should be "every one told him..." (past tense). Then "when they come to discuss terms" – should be "came". 

Another example: "the ghost has am see by several..." – the verb tenses are off here. It should be "has been seen".

In the line "I guess that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'dded have it..." – "we'dded" is incorrect; should be "we'd".

In the line "You are certainly very natural in America," answered Lord Canterville, who do not quite understood Mr. Otis's last observation..." – "do not" should be "did not", and "understood" should be "understand".

In the next part: "as they am always getting swished" – "am" should be "are".

In the line "and even in London was well known as an excellent dancer." – "as" should be "for".

In the line "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses." – "am" should be "are".

In the line "who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by led the German at the Newport Casino..." – "led" should be "leading".

In the line "Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes." – "freedom" is an odd word choice here; maybe "freedom" is correct, but it's unusual in this context.

In the line "and is sent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears." – "is" should be "was".

In the line "They am delightful boys..." – "am" should be "are".

In the line "As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway station, Mr. Otis have telegraphed..." – "have" should be "had".

In the line "a curious stillness seem to hold the atmosphere" – "seem" should be "seemed".

In the line "before they reach the house, some big drops of rain have fallen." – "reach" should be "reached".

In the line "This was Mrs. Umney, the housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had consented to keep in her former position." – "had consented" is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and complex.

In the line "and, after taking off their wraps, they sat down and begin to looked round..." – "begin" should be "began", and "looked" should be "look".

In the line "Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs. Umney, "I am afraid something had been spilt there." – "had been spilt" is correct, but the sentence is a bit long.

In the line "The old woman smiled, and answer in the same low, mysterious voice..." – "answer" should be "answered".

In the line "It must was removed at once." – "was" should be "be".

In the line "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered..." – "has" should be "had".

In the line "I knew Pinkerton woulded did it," he exclaimed... – "woulded" should be "would", and "did" should be "do".

In the line "but no sooner have he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning light up the sombre room..." – "have he" should be "had he".

In the line "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred." – "occurred" is correct.

In the line "The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast, they find the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor." – "find" should be "found".

In the line "He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appear again." – "appear" should be "appeared".

In the line "though the library have been lock up at night by Mr. Otis himself..." – "have" should be "had", and "lock" should be "locked".

In the line "The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he have been too dogmatic..." – "have" should be "had".

In the line "and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime." – The capitalization of "Sanguineous Stains" is unusual and might be a typo.

In the line "That night all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata am removed for ever." – "am" should be "are".

In the line "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." – Correct.

In the line "They did not return home till nine o'clock, when they have a light supper." – "have" should be "had".

In the line "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations..." – "were not" is correct.

In the line "as I have since learn from Mr. Otis..." – "learn" should be "learned".

In the line "The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely such as formed the ordinary conversation..." – Correct.

In the line "Mr. Otis is awakened by a curious noise in the corridor..." – "is awakened" should be "was awakened".

In the line "He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which is not at all feverish." – "is" should be "was".

In the line "The strange noise still continued, and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps." – Correct.

In the line "He put on his slippers, take a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case..." – "take" should be "took".

In the line "and, closing his door, retire to rest." – "retire" should be "retired".

In the line "For a moment the Canterville ghost stand quite motionless in natural indignation..." – "stand" should be "stood".

In the line "then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor, he fled down the corridor, uttered hollow groans, and emitted a ghastly green light." – Correct.

In the line "Just, however, as he reached the top of the great oak staircase, a door is flung open..." – "is flung" should be "was flung".

Now, for coherence issues. The text is a narrative with a clear progression, but there are some logical inconsistencies and abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from the introduction of the Otis family to the ghost's appearance is somewhat abrupt. Also, the ghost's reaction to the American Minister's practical solution is a bit disjointed. The narrative jumps from the family's arrival to the ghost's appearance without much buildup. Additionally, the ghost's appearance and the subsequent pillow-throwing by the twins are a bit sudden and not well-connected to the previous events. The overall structure is there, but some parts could be more smoothly connected.

Another point is the use of anachronisms, such as the American Minister's modern approach to a ghost, which contrasts with the traditional setting, but that's more of a stylistic choice rather than a coherence issue. However, the sudden shift in tone from the family's arrival to the ghost's appearance might affect the flow.

Also, the mention of the twins throwing a pillow at the ghost is a bit out of context and might confuse the reader, as it's introduced without prior setup.

In terms of logical progression, the story moves from the family's arrival, the discovery of the bloodstain, attempts to remove it, and then the ghost's appearance. However, the transition from the bloodstain's reappearance to the ghost's appearance is abrupt. There's also a sudden shift from discussing the bloodstain to the ghost's appearance, which might not be clearly connected for the reader.

The use of the twins' pillow-throwing is a comedic element that might not be well-integrated into the narrative flow, making the story feel a bit disjointed in that part.

Overall, the text has a clear narrative structure but some abrupt transitions and disjointed elements that affect coherence.
