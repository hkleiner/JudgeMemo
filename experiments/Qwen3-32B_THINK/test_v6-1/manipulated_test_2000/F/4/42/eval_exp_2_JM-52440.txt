These are numerous and significant grammatical issues that affect the readability and clarity of the text. The author is clearly trying to write in a formal, archaic style, but has made many mistakes in the process. The text contains numerous subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect verb forms, tense inconsistencies, and awkward phrasing.

## COHERENCE EVALUATION

Looking for logical flow, organization, and clarity of ideas:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. The introduction sets up a discussion of the Church of England's doctrine but quickly moves to Scripture, then back to the Church, then to the Articles, etc.
2. [LOGIC] The author makes assertions about what the Church of England teaches without providing sufficient evidence to support these claims.
3. [CLARITY] The text uses complex and archaic language that makes it difficult to follow the author's arguments.
4. [LOGIC] The author presents a position (that the Church of England does not teach the Real Presence) and then immediately contradicts it by acknowledging that this is a matter of controversy.
5. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized in a somewhat haphazard way, jumping from the introduction to a discussion of the Real Presence, then to the Articles, then back to other topics.
6. [LOGIC] The author makes sweeping generalizations about the Church of England's teaching without providing a balanced view of the topic.
7. [CLARITY] The text is written in an archaic style that makes it difficult for modern readers to understand the author's points.
8. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraphing and organization, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
9. [LOGIC] The author presents arguments and then qualifies them, making it difficult to determine the author's actual position.
10. [CLARITY] The text contains many theological terms that are not clearly defined, making it difficult to understand the author's arguments.

The text attempts to present a coherent argument about the Church of England's doctrine of the Eucharist, but the numerous grammatical issues and the archaic, complex language make it difficult to follow. The author's arguments are often presented in a confusing way, with contradictory statements and a lack of clear organization.

## FINAL SCORES

For fluency, I would give a score of 2. The text has numerous and significant grammatical issues that make reading and understanding difficult. The author's attempts to use formal, archaic language have led to many errors in grammar, verb forms, and tense usage.

For coherence, I would give a score of 3. The text has a clear topic and attempts to present an argument, but the organization is somewhat haphazard and the author's arguments are often confusing or contradictory. The archaic language and complex structure make it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
