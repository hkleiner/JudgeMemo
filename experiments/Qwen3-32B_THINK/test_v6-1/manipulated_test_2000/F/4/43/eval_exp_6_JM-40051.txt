Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to look at fluency. The user mentioned checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, and common English usage.

Looking at the text, there are a few obvious issues. For example, in the first paragraph, there's a sentence that starts with a dash and a colon, which might be a formatting issue. Then, in "have ventured to publish it," the verb tense is inconsistent. The text has a lot of run-on sentences, which affects fluency. Also, there are some misspellings like "admirirg" instead of "admiring" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions." There's also a missing comma in "and admirirg its most wonderful scenery," which could be a syntax problem. The phrase "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some" uses "opening" in a way that's not standard, which is a usage issue. 

Now, moving to coherence. The main idea is about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location. However, the structure is a bit all over the place. The author jumps from explaining why they were slow to publish to discussing the Bible's description, then to the geographical details. There are some abrupt transitions, like from the rivers to the specific cities in the US. The connection between the biblical references and the American location isn't very clear. Also, some parts are repetitive, like mentioning the Garden of Eden's location multiple times without a clear progression. There's a paragraph that seems like a list of names and places without much explanation, which makes it hard to follow. The final paragraph about the scenery and the city of La Crosse also feels disconnected from the main argument.

For the fluency score, considering the number of errors but the overall readability, maybe a 3.5. The text is generally understandable but has enough issues that affect flow. For coherence, the logical progression is weak with several abrupt shifts, so a 2.5 might be appropriate. The author's main point is there, but the structure and transitions make it hard to follow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "have ventured to publish it" lacks subject-verb agreement). - [SPELLING] Misspellings (e.g., "admirirg," "dimentions," "antldiluvians"). - [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with missing punctuation (e.g., "and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers"). - [LEXICON] Nonstandard word usage ("opening to the minds of some," "by degrees it has been opening"). - [STRUCTURE] Fragmented sentences (e.g., "But possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed.").

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Weak connections between biblical references and American geography (e.g., abrupt shifts from Eden to Mississippi River). - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization (e.g., paragraphs about cities and rivers lack clear progression). - [CLARITY] Repetitive claims without resolution (e.g., repeated "our garden is in the right place" without evidence). - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., from rattlesnakes to La Crosse's lumber mills). - [LOGIC] Contradictory claims (e.g., "no such spot" in traditional regions but unproven claims about Mississippi).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
