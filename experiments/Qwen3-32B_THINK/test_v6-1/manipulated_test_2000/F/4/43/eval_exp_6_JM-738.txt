Let me analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll look at the fluency issues in the text:

1. There are numerous grammatical issues:
   - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement problems (e.g., "the attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched")
   - [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions (e.g., "Of Mr. Proctorâ€™s theory I offer some necessary corrections")
   - [GRAMMAR] Run-on sentences and sentence fragments
   - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of tenses and verb forms

2. There are spelling and punctuation issues:
   - [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "babblings-one half andunder")
   - [PUNCTUATION] Missing or misplaced punctuation
   - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent capitalization

3. There are syntax and structure issues:
   - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and word order
   - [STRUCTURE] Incomplete or fragmented sentences
   - [STRUCTURE] Sentences that are too long or convoluted

4. There are lexical issues:
   - [LEXICON] Non-standard or unclear word usage
   - [LEXICON] Words that don't make sense in context

Now for coherence issues:

1. There are logical issues:
   - [LOGIC] Inconsistent or unclear reasoning
   - [LOGIC] Missing connections between ideas

2. There are structural issues:
   - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed paragraphs
   - [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear progression of ideas

3. There are clarity issues:
   - [CLARITY] Unclear or ambiguous references
   - [CLARITY] Missing context for some statements

4. There are transition issues:
   - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics
   - [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitions between paragraphs

Based on the evaluation criteria and the issues I've identified, I'll now assign scores:

For fluency:
The text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure. While there are some clear segments, the numerous errors make comprehension difficult at times. This fits the description for a score of 2.

For coherence:
The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas. While there is some understanding possible in parts, the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort. This also fits the description for a score of 2.
