Let me carefully evaluate the given text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

# Fluency Issues

I need to look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, and issues with clarity or natural English usage.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." - This sentence is completely incoherent with repeated words and no clear structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality." - This has grammatical issues with subject-verb agreement ("the manner of the two are") and awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "When the body feeds materially on the one, the believerâ€™s heart feeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the one must not be confounded with the other." - This is grammatically correct but has some awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that." - This is an incoherent run-on sentence with no clear structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into." - This is another incoherent run-on sentence with no clear structure.

These are serious grammatical issues that significantly impact readability.

# Coherence Issues

Now I need to look for logical flow problems, disconnected ideas, and issues with the overall organization of the text.

- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with a title, introduction, and chapters, which is good for coherence.
- [LOGIC] The text presents a clear argument about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, comparing it to Roman Catholic teachings, which provides logical progression.
- [LOGIC] The author is making a clear distinction between the Church of England's position and the Roman Catholic position on the Real Presence, which is logically presented.
- [LOGIC] The author is examining the Articles of the Church of England to determine its teaching on the subject, which is a logical approach.

However, there are some issues:

- [LOGIC] The text jumps between complex theological concepts without always providing clear transitions between them.
- [CLARITY] Some of the theological concepts are presented in a dense and complex manner that could be more clearly explained.
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and concepts.

The text is generally coherent in its argument, but there are some areas where the logical flow could be improved.

# Final Scores

For fluency, the text has several serious grammatical issues and some awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. These issues are not minor and do interrupt the flow and clarity of the text. I would rate fluency as 2.5.

For coherence, the text has a clear structure and logical progression in its argument, but there are some areas where the flow could be improved. The text is generally coherent but has some issues with transitions and clarity in explaining complex concepts. I would rate coherence as 3.5.

Let me double check these ratings against the evaluation criteria:

Fluency:
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 2.5 is appropriate as the text has significant but not completely overwhelming fluency issues.

Coherence:
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 3.5 is appropriate as the text is generally coherent but has some noticeable issues with transitions and clarity.
