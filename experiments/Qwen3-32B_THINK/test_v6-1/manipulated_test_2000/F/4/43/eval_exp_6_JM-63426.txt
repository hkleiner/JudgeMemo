Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

**Fluency Issues**:

1. [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." - This sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing.

2. [GRAMMAR] "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." - This sentence has incorrect grammar and is difficult to understand.

3. [SYNTAX] "The bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar "version old pretends." - This sentence has poor syntax and is difficult to parse.

4. [SPELLING] "Wayside" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect word in context.

5. [SPELLING] "Godbut" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect word in context.

6. [SPELLING] "anywayarithmetic" - This appears to be a run-together word that should be separated.

7. [SPELLING] "version old pretends" - This phrase doesn't make sense in context and appears to be a series of words that should form a coherent phrase.

8. [SYNTAX] "In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through." - This sentence is awkwardly constructed.

9. [SYNTAX] "You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press." - The phrasing "washing-up" is awkward in this context.

10. [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked." - This sentence is unclear and the meaning is ambiguous.

**Coherence Issues**:

1. [LOGIC] The transition from the introduction to the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter is abrupt without clear connection or explanation.

2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions.

3. [CLARITY] The chronology of events is sometimes confusing, making it hard to follow the timeline of Will Bradley's life.

4. [LOGIC] The text references historical events and people (like Theodore Roosevelt) without sufficient context for readers who may not be familiar with these references.

5. [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are very long and contain multiple unrelated ideas without clear organization.

6. [LOGIC] The narrative occasionally shifts abruptly between different aspects of Bradley's life without clear connections.

7. [CLARITY] Some passages are overly descriptive and could be more concise without losing meaning.

8. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new information without proper setup or explanation.

9. [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text could benefit from clearer sectioning and organization.

10. [LOGIC] Some historical references (like the lawsuit with Theodore Roosevelt) are mentioned but not fully explained in context.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

**Fluency Score**: I'll give a 3.5. The text is generally readable but contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow. There are a few particularly problematic sentences that make comprehension difficult.

**Coherence Score**: I'll give a 3.0. The text has a narrative structure but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. Some parts are well-organized, but the overall coherence is affected by the lack of clear connections between ideas and events.
