Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given text using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. The text is an analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammatical correctness, sentence structure, repetition, and clarity. The text is quite formal and academic, which is common in literary analysis. Let me scan for any obvious issues.

First, I notice some instances of missing commas after introductory phrases. For example, "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction..." The comma after "Dickens" is missing. There are also some instances where the use of italics and quotation marks might be inconsistent. 

Looking for repetition, the phrase "we may think" is used multiple times. Also, "he" and "he" references can be ambiguous in some parts. There's a sentence that says, "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The structure here is a bit awkward and might be clearer with a rephrasing.

Now, coherence. The text is about analyzing a novel's plot and characters, so logical flow is important. The introduction sets up the discussion of Dickens's construction in his later works and introduces "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The sections on the story and characters follow, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, moving from discussing Dickens's health to the characters in the novel feels a bit jarring. Also, the section on the opening of the tale could be more clearly connected to the preceding analysis.

Some ideas are introduced without clear transitions. For instance, the mention of Forster's comment on Dickens's interest in the supernatural is followed by a reference to "The Signalman," which might not be as clearly connected as it could be. Additionally, the conclusion of the introduction jumps into the analysis of the story and characters without a smooth segue.

Overall, the text is well-structured for an academic analysis, but there are minor issues in both fluency and coherence that could be improved. However, since the user wants the most serious problems that justify point deductions, I'll focus on those.

For fluency, the main issues are missing commas and awkward phrasing. For coherence, the abrupt transitions and unclear connections between sections are the main problems. The text is generally coherent, but these issues do affect the flow.
