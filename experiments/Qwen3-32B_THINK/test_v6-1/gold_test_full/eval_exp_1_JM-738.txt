Let me analyze this text according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I'll evaluate the FLUENCY of the text, looking for grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and clarity of expression.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" - The sentence structure is awkward and the quotation marks are inconsistently used.
- [SYNTAX] "But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of “hab nab at a venture.”" - This sentence is overly complex and difficult to parse.
- [SPELLING] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises." - The word "rich" is used in a way that doesn't quite fit the context.
- [GRAMMAR] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." - The sentence structure is awkward and confusing.
- [SYNTAX] "Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales rivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as _Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_." - The sentence structure is awkward and the meaning is unclear.

Let me continue identifying fluency issues:

- [SYNTAX] "“Youth will be served;” no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”" - The sentence structure is awkward and the meaning is unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] "In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of Ralph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the innumerable attractions." - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of "of" is inconsistent.

- [SYNTAX] "He therefore abandoned a new series of Readings." - The sentence is incomplete and lacks clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] "We think of Scott’s earlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, “smacked of the apoplexy.”" - The sentence structure is awkward and the meaning is unclear.

Let me continue identifying fluency issues:

- [SYNTAX] "But Dickens’s new story of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character by the emergence of “a very curious and new idea,” early in August, does not “smack of the apoplexy.”" - The sentence is overly complex and difficult to parse.
- [SPELLING] "We may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour." - The sentence is awkward and the use of "humour" is inconsistent with the rest of the text.
- [SYNTAX] "“The Billickin,” on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is “in very gracious fooling:” her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss Twinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises." - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of quotation marks is inconsistent.
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Grewgious may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason;" - The sentence is awkward and the meaning is unclear.

- [GRAMMAR] "As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the restraint which she puts on her “tigerish blood” is admirable: she is very fresh and original." - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of quotation marks is inconsistent.
- [SYNTAX] "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the “atmosphere” of a small cathedral town." - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of quotation marks is inconsistent.
- [GRAMMAR] "Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the other hand, the opium den is studied from the life." - The sentence structure is awkward and the meaning is unclear.
- [SYNTAX] "On the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot, his secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader." - The sentence is repetitive and awkward.

Let me continue identifying fluency issues:
