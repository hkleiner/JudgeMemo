I'll analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues and provide the requested evaluation form.

First, let me understand the text: It appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. It's written in a narrative style with an introduction, several chapters, and a chronology at the end. The writing has a somewhat old-fashioned tone, which is appropriate for the subject matter.

For fluency, I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with clarity in individual sentences.
For coherence, I'll check if the text as a whole makes logical sense, with smooth transitions between ideas and well-organized content.

Starting with fluency issues:

1. There are some instances of inconsistent tense usage, particularly in the second chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeeming" where the narrative shifts between past and present tense without clear reason.
2. Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow (e.g., in the chapter "Springfield: The Wayside Press").
3. There are a few instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, particularly in complex sentences.
4. There are occasional instances of unclear pronoun reference (e.g., "He" or "They" without clear antecedents).
5. Some words are used in an archaic or unusual way that may be confusing to modern readers.
6. There are some minor spelling errors, like "Ishpeming" being spelled inconsistently.

For coherence issues:

1. The text jumps between different time periods without clear transitions, making it sometimes difficult to follow the chronology.
2. Some chapters start abruptly without clear connection to the previous content.
3. There are some abrupt shifts in perspective, particularly in the first chapter where the narrative voice shifts between third-person and second-person.
4. Some concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter (e.g., specific printing terms).
5. The text sometimes assumes a level of knowledge about the printing industry and historical context that may not be common to all readers.
6. There are occasional repetitions of information across different sections.

Now I'll rate the text according to the given criteria:

For fluency:
The text is generally well-written with clear sentences and good grammar. While there are some issues with complex sentence structure and occasional tense inconsistencies, these don't significantly hinder understanding. I would rate it a 4.

For coherence:
The text has a clear chronological structure, but there are some issues with transitions between sections and the use of different narrative voices. The text is generally coherent and logical, but the shifts in perspective and some abrupt transitions could be improved. I would rate it a 4.

Let me review my assessment to make sure it aligns with the criteria:

Fluency Scale:
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.

Coherence Scale:
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.

I think these ratings are appropriate for the text.
