Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency issues. Fluency relates to the grammatical correctness, clarity, and natural phrasing of the text. I'll go through the text and look for any issues in these areas.

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains some awkward phrasing, such as "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced." The phrase "entering on" is somewhat archaic and could be replaced with "entering into" for better clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] The sentence "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" is a bit long and could be split for better readability.
- [GRAMMAR] "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching" could be more concise as "But those loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with such a representation of its teaching."
- [GRAMMAR] "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better flow.
- [GRAMMAR] The sentence "The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to the body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible gift on the soul" is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.
- [GRAMMAR] "And yet, notwithstanding all this, there are those who boldly affirm that the doctrine of the real presence of our blessed Lord and Saviour in the elements is the undoubted teaching of the Church of England" is quite long and could be split for better readability.
- [GRAMMAR] "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth" is awkward and could be rephrased.
- [GRAMMAR] "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith" could be clearer as "The means by which the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means by which the soul feeds is faith."

For coherence, I'll look at how well the text is organized, how logically the ideas flow, and how well the text maintains a clear focus.

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and could benefit from being divided into shorter paragraphs for better readability.
- [CLARITY] The text is dense with theological concepts and could be more accessible to a general reader.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing the Articles to the Catechism is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The argument is logical and well-structured, but the length and complexity of the text may make it difficult for some readers to follow the flow of the argument.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, Homilies) without clear transitions, which could confuse the reader.
- [CLARITY] The text uses a lot of theological jargon that may not be familiar to all readers, such as "transubstantiation," "consubstantiation," and "ad command."

Now, let's rate the fluency and coherence of the text on a scale from 1 to 5:

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
The text has a logical structure and presents a clear argument about the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper. However, the length, complexity, and dense theological content make it challenging for some readers to follow. The transitions between different sections could be smoother, and the text would benefit from being divided into shorter paragraphs for better readability.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
The text is generally grammatically correct and clear, but it contains some awkward phrasing and long, complex sentences that could be simplified for better readability. The archaic language and theological jargon may also make the text less accessible to a general audience.
