Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency issues. Fluency relates to the quality of individual sentences—whether they're grammatically correct, clear, and follow common English usage. I'll go through the text and look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or repetitive structures.

First, I notice several grammatical issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "have ventured to publish it" should be "have ventured to publish them" if referring to multiple articles.
- [GRAMMAR] "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" has an unnecessary comma and could be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "how mankind corrupted themselves" should be "how mankind corrupted itself" since "mankind" is singular.
- [GRAMMAR] "he could not point it out to them" should be "he could not point it out to them" is actually correct, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent" has a missing comma before "nor" and "any one" should be "anyone" (one word).
- [GRAMMAR] "the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" has an extra comma and could be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" is a spelling error ("admirirg" should be "admiriNg").
- [GRAMMAR] "its proper dimentions" is a spelling error ("dimentions" should be "dimensions").
- [GRAMMAR] "I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion" should be "I became sensibly impressed by the suggestion."
- [GRAMMAR] "This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled" should be "This is the garden of Eden. At which suggestion I smiled."
- [GRAMMAR] "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have discovered them" has a missing comma before "or" and could be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory investigation." is missing a comma after "hope."

Now, let's look for other fluency issues:
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" should be "admiriNg".
- [SPELLING] "dimentions" should be "dimensions".
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians".
- [SPELLING] "sensably" should be "sensibly".
- [SPELLING] "beau ideal" is correct, but "beau" is often used as an abbreviation for "beau ideal" in this context.
- [SPELLING] "beau ideal of a garden" is correct.
- [SPELLING] "Yosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a garden" should be "Yosemite, small, romantic and grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a garden."
- [SPELLING] "the one half of its greatness was not told" should be "the one-half of its greatness was not told."
- [SPELLING] "the one solid smooth topped hill" should be "the one solid, smooth-topped hill."
- [SPELLING] "Heald’s quarry" should be "Heald's quarry" (apostrophe is correct).
- [SPELLING] "the one of the most desirable places for a human being to dwell" should be "one of the most desirable places for a human being to dwell."
- [SPELLING] "the native home of the speckled trout" is correct.
- [SPELLING] "the most desirable places for a human being to dwell. Conducive of human happiness:" should be "the most desirable places for a human being to dwell. Conducive to human happiness."
- [SPELLING] "the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer temperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its inhabitants north and south." is awkward and could be rephrased.
- [SPELLING] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" is awkward and could be rephrased.
- [SPELLING] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place." is awkward and could be rephrased.
- [SPELLING] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place. But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." is awkward and could be rephrased.
- [SPELLING] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place. But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." is awkward and could be rephrased.
- [SPELLING] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place. But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." is awkward and could be rephrased.

Now, for coherence issues. Coherence relates to how well the sentences and ideas connect logically and form a unified whole.

- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics and ideas without clear transitions. For example, it moves from the author's personal experience to a detailed description of the landscape, then to historical and religious references, then back to the landscape again, without clear connections between these sections.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure or organization. It seems to follow the author's thoughts as they occur, rather than a logical progression of ideas.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are unclear or confusing. For example, the author's claim about finding the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley is not clearly supported by evidence or reasoning in a logical manner.
- [TRANSITION] There are few or no transitions between paragraphs or ideas. The text jumps from one topic to another without any indication of how these topics are connected.
- [LOGIC] The author makes several claims without providing sufficient evidence to support them. For example, they claim to have found the Garden of Eden based on a comparison with the biblical description, but they don't provide a systematic analysis or evidence for this claim.
- [LOGIC] The author references various historical and religious figures and texts without clearly explaining how these relate to their main argument.
- [LOGIC] The text contains many tangents and digressions that don't contribute to the main argument or provide a clear connection to the author's claim.
- [LOGIC] The author makes several assumptions without providing evidence or reasoning to support them. For example, they assume that the Mississippi River corresponds to the Euphrates River in the Bible without providing any justification for this assumption.
- [LOGIC] The text contains several contradictions or inconsistencies. For example, the author claims to have found the Garden of Eden, but also acknowledges that this is a controversial and disputed topic.
- [LOGIC] The author references other works and authors (like Dr. Warren and Engel) without providing a clear comparison or evaluation of their arguments in relation to their own.

Overall, the text has several fluency issues, including grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward ph
