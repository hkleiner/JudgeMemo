Alright, I need to evaluate the coherence of this text. Let me start by reading through it carefully to understand the main points and how they connect.

The text is about the author's claim that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific area in the United States, particularly near the Mississippi River. The author references biblical descriptions, geographical features, and historical context to support this claim. 

Now, looking for coherence issues. Coherence involves logical flow, clear transitions, and consistent structure. Let me check for any problems in these areas.

First, the text is quite long and meanders through various points without a clear structure. The author jumps from one idea to another without smooth transitions. For example, after discussing the discovery and publication of the findings, the text suddenly shifts to the location details and then to descriptions of the landscape. There's no clear progression, making it hard to follow.

Second, there are abrupt shifts in the narrative. The author starts by explaining the decision to publish, then moves to biblical references, then to the geographical location, and later to the current state of the area. These shifts are not connected logically, leading to confusion.

Third, the text contains repetitive statements. The author frequently reiterates the location and the significance of the Mississippi River as the Euphrates, which could have been more concisely presented.

Fourth, some sentences are unclear or have grammatical issues that affect coherence. For example, "It should was sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed" is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the flow. Such errors make it harder to understand the intended meaning.

Fifth, the author uses a lot of descriptive language about the landscape, but these descriptions are not well integrated with the main argument. They serve more as tangents, which breaks the logical sequence.

Additionally, the text includes personal anecdotes and historical claims without sufficient context, which can confuse the reader. For instance, the mention of Mr. Dovile killing rattlesnakes is a specific detail that doesn't clearly support the main argument about Eden's location.

There are also inconsistencies in the narrative. The author mentions that the location was discovered based on the Bible but then contradicts this by pointing to specific geographical features, which might not align with biblical descriptions. This inconsistency can undermine the coherence of the argument.

The conclusion is abrupt, with the author stating the findings and hoping for further investigation, but without summarizing the key points or reinforcing the argument's structure.

Considering all these issues, the text lacks a clear, logical flow. The author's enthusiasm and detailed descriptions are present, but the lack of structure and transitions makes the argument difficult to follow. The frequent shifts and repetitions hinder the overall coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from publication rationale to biblical exegesis to geographic description without clear transitions).  
- [LOGIC] Weak causal connections between claims (e.g., linking rattlesnakes to Eden’s “serpent” lacks logical foundation).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing sentence structures and grammatical errors (e.g., “should was sought,” “was being effaced” disrupt comprehension).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases to guide readers between sections (e.g., sudden jumps from historical context to landscape descriptions).  
- [REPETITION] Redundant emphasis on the Mississippi as the Euphrates and Eden’s location, diluting narrative focus.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
