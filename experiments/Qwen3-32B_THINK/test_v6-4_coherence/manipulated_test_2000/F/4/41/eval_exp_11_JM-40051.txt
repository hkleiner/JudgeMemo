Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence of the given text on a scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to identify the main issues affecting coherence.

Starting with the structure, the text is quite long and seems to jump around in different sections. The author mentions a discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location but doesn't present the information in a linear or organized manner. There are a lot of references to the Bible and geographical features, but the flow between these ideas isn't smooth.

Next, transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, the text starts with the author's personal experience and then shifts to explaining biblical references without clear connections. This makes it hard to follow the narrative. Also, some sections are repetitive, like the repeated emphasis on the Mississippi River as the Euphrates, which doesn't add new information and just confuses the reader.

There's also a problem with clarity. The author uses a lot of jargon and unclear terms, such as "antldiluvians" and "thr 'North West'," which are either misspelled or not well-defined. This hinders understanding. Additionally, the text includes a mix of personal anecdotes, historical references, and speculative claims without a clear distinction, making the overall message muddled.

Another issue is the lack of logical sequencing. The argument presented is that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific area in the US, but the supporting points are not logically ordered. The author jumps from biblical interpretations to geographical descriptions without a clear progression that builds the argument effectively.

There are also some inconsistencies in the narrative. For instance, the author mentions that the location was a mystery until the discovery but then later states that others had already considered the American continent. This creates confusion about the timeline and validity of the claims.

The text also has some typographical errors and misspellings, which, while not directly affecting coherence, can distract the reader and reduce the overall clarity. Examples include "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "prlper dimentions" instead of "proper dimensions."

In terms of coherence, the text lacks a clear structure and logical flow, has abrupt transitions, and includes unclear and repetitive content. These issues make it difficult for the reader to follow the author's argument and understand the connections between different parts of the text. The author's attempt to blend personal experience with biblical and geographical analysis isn't effectively organized, leading to a disjointed narrative.

Considering all these points, the text would likely receive a lower score on the coherence scale. The main problems are in structure, transitions, and clarity, which are critical for a coherent narrative. The author's failure to present ideas in a logical sequence and the presence of confusing elements significantly impact the text's coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative with abrupt shifts between personal anecdotes, biblical interpretations, and geographical claims without clear connections.  
- [LOGIC] Illogical sequencing of ideas (e.g., shifting from the author’s discovery to unrelated historical speculations about Noah’s location).  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs, creating a fragmented reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear or ambiguous references (e.g., "thr ‘North West’," "antldiluvians") that hinder understanding.  
- [REPETITION] Redundant emphasis on the Mississippi River as the Euphrates and the garden’s location without resolving contradictions.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
