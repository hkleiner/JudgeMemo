I'll evaluate the text based on coherence, following the instructions carefully.

First, I'll look for coherence issues in the text:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a critical analysis of Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" but lacks a clear organizational structure. The introduction is followed by a section labeled "The Story" with a "Dramatis Personae" and "Opening of the Tale," but there's no clear progression or thematic organization of ideas.

2) [LOGIC] The text jumps between different aspects of the analysis without clear logical connections. For example, it moves from discussing Dickens' writing style to character descriptions to plot analysis without smooth transitions.

3) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous typographical and spelling errors that make it difficult to follow. Examples include "assiduously cultivated" with a typo in "cultivated," "demned outline" with a typo in "demned," and "assiduously cultivated" with a typo in "cultivated."

4) [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between sections and ideas. For example, the text moves from discussing Dickens' health to character analysis to plot analysis without clear transitional phrases.

5) [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear thesis statement or central argument about Dickens' work, making it difficult to follow the author's purpose.

6) [CLARITY] The text uses complex and sometimes confusing sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the author's arguments.

7) [COHERENCE] The text begins with a discussion of Dickens' writing style in his later novels, but then shifts to a detailed analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without clearly connecting these topics.

8) [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory or confusing statements without resolution. For example, it states that Dickens' later novels "rivals in merit his early picaresque stories" but then says "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'"

9) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous archaic or unclear references without proper context, such as "Sir Thomas Watson reported" and "Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets."

10) [COHERENCE] The text ends with a section labeled "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" that appears disconnected from the previous sections and doesn't clearly contribute to the overall analysis.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as a 2.5 on the coherence scale. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort, but it's not completely incoherent and some parts are understandable.

Let me double-check my assessment:

The text has a clear focus on analyzing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," but the organization is poor and the logical connections between ideas are weak. The author presents some interesting points about Dickens' work, but the presentation is marred by structural issues, confusing transitions, and numerous typographical errors. The lack of a clear thesis and the abrupt shifts between topics significantly affect the coherence.

The text is not entirely incoherent (which would warrant a score of 1), as there are some understandable parts and a clear subject matter. However, the numerous coherence issues prevent it from being considered mostly coherent (which would warrant a score of 4).

Therefore, I believe a score of 2.5 is appropriate.
