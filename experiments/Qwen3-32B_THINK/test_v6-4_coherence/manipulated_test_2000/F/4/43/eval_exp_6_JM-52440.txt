Alright, let's start by reading through the text carefully. The title is "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England," which suggests it's a theological analysis. The introduction sets up the context about the Church of England's teachings and the controversy around the Real Presence. 

First, I need to check for coherence. Coherence here means the text should have a logical flow, clear transitions, and avoid abrupt shifts. Let me look for any issues.

In the introduction, the author mentions the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice as the three main points. Then, in Chapter I, they focus on the Real Presence. The structure seems logical so far. However, when discussing the Church of England's stance versus Rome, the author brings up differences but doesn't clearly outline how each section connects to the next. 

Looking at the sections on the Articles, there's a detailed explanation of sacraments. The author contrasts the Church of England's view with Rome's, but the transition from discussing the definition of sacraments to the specific articles is a bit abrupt. Also, the explanation of the 25th and 27th Articles is thorough, but the connection to the main argument about the Real Presence isn't always clear. 

I notice some parts where the author uses complex theological terms without sufficient explanation, which might confuse readers not familiar with the subject. For example, terms like "communion of the blood of Christ" are mentioned without defining their significance in the context. This lack of clarity could affect coherence.

There are also instances where the author's arguments seem to loop back without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Articles, the text jumps to discussing the consecration process and the role of the Holy Spirit, which might not smoothly follow the previous points. 

Another issue is the repetition of certain ideas. The author emphasizes the distinction between the visible sign and the invisible gift multiple times, but the repetition isn't always necessary and can make the text feel redundant. This redundancy might disrupt the flow.

The conclusion of the section on the Articles mentions the importance of the Church's integrity, which ties back to the introduction's concern about the Church being misunderstood. However, the transition from the theological discussion to the broader implications for the Church is a bit jarring and could use smoother linking.

Overall, while the text is well-structured in its sections (introduction, Real Presence, Articles, etc.), there are areas where the transitions between ideas are abrupt, some concepts are not clearly explained, and repetition occurs. These issues affect the overall coherence, making the argument a bit harder to follow for the reader.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts between theological definitions and broader contextual arguments without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Key theological terms (e.g., "communion," "real presence") are used without consistent definitions, creating ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the subject.
- [LOGIC] The argument sometimes loops back to previously stated points (e.g., visible vs. invisible sign) without advancing the narrative, causing redundancy.
- [TRANSITION] Jumps between the Church of England's doctrinal stance and broader implications for the Church's integrity lack smooth connections.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
