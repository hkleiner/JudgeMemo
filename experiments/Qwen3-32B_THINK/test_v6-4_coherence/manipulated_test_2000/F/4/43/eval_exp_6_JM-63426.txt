Okay, let me start by carefully reading through the given text to understand what it's about and identify any coherence issues. The text is an introduction to a chap book about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist. The first chapter, "An Introduction," discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, his style, and his influence compared to European movements. The second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," details Bradley's early life and career beginnings.

Now, I'll analyze the text for coherence. Coherence involves logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clarity, and a consistent narrative flow. Let me look for any problems in these areas.

1. **Structure and Flow**: The first chapter is a general introduction that sets the context of Bradley's work and its significance. The second chapter is a detailed narrative of Bradley's childhood and early career. This structure seems logical, but I need to check if there are any abrupt shifts or inconsistencies between these sections.

2. **Transitions**: The transition from the introduction to the biographical chapter is clear, but within each chapter, I need to check for smooth transitions between ideas. For example, in the first chapter, the author moves from discussing Bradley's impact to comparing him with European artists. The flow seems logical, but there might be some jumps.

3. **Clarity and Ambiguity**: The text is generally clear, but there are a few sentences that are confusing or ambiguous. For instance, in the first chapter, the sentence "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't make sense. Similarly, in the second chapter, there are several sentences with grammatical errors and unclear phrasing, such as "the bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'" These issues disrupt the flow and make parts of the text difficult to understand.

4. **Repetition and Redundancy**: I'll check if there are any repetitive ideas or unnecessary information that could be streamlined. For example, in the first chapter, the author discusses Bradley's impact and his style, but there's a bit of repetition in emphasizing his influence on American graphic arts.

5. **Logical Sequencing**: The narrative in the second chapter is chronological, which is appropriate for a biographical section. However, there are some jumps in time and events that might be confusing. For instance, the transition from Bradley's childhood in Lynn to moving to Swampscott and then to Boston is clear, but the mention of his stepfather and subsequent job at the newspaper office might be a bit abrupt.

6. **Consistency in Tone and Style**: The tone shifts slightly between the introduction and the biographical chapter. The introduction is more analytical and reflective, while the second chapter is a detailed narrative. This shift is expected in a book with different sections, but I need to ensure that it doesn't create a jarring experience for the reader.

7. **Specific Issues in the Text**:
   - In the first chapter, the sentence about the Kelmscott House and Bradley's printing press is confusing due to grammatical errors: "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." This sentence is incoherent and disrupts the flow.
   - In the second chapter, there are several grammatical errors and unclear phrases that make the narrative difficult to follow. For example, "the bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'" This sentence is incomprehensible and needs to be addressed.
   - The narrative in the second chapter jumps between different events and locations without clear transitions, which could confuse the reader. For instance, the move from Boston to Northern Michigan, and then to various towns, is mentioned without sufficient context or explanation.

8. **Overall Coherence**: Despite some issues, the text has a clear structure and the main ideas are generally well-organized. The introduction sets up the context for understanding Bradley's work, and the biographical chapter provides a chronological account of his early life. However, the grammatical errors and unclear sentences in both chapters do affect the overall coherence.

Based on this analysis, I can identify several coherence issues that need to be addressed. The most significant problems are the grammatical errors and unclear sentences that disrupt the flow and make parts of the text difficult to understand. Additionally, there are some abrupt transitions and jumps in the narrative that could be smoothed out for better coherence.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] Incoherent sentence structure in first chapter: "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work."
- [CLARITY] Unclear and fragmented sentences in second chapter: "the bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'"
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from introduction to biographical narrative without clear connecting elements
- [LOGIC] Disjointed chronology in second chapter with unclear time markers between different life events
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts between different locations (Lynn, Swampscott, Boston, Ishpeming) without smooth narrative transitions
- [CLARITY] Confusing references to historical events without sufficient context (e.g., Theodore Roosevelt libel case)

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
