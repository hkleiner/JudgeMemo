Okay, let's start by reading through the text carefully to understand the main points. The author is claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, comparing the Mississippi River to the Euphrates from the Bible and describing the geographical features of the area.

First, I need to check for coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow and connect logically. The text is quite long, so I'll break it down into sections. The author starts by explaining their hesitation in publishing the discovery, then delves into the biblical account, followed by the geographical features of the supposed Garden of Eden, and ends with descriptions of the landscape and the presence of rattlesnakes.

Now, looking for coherence issues. One thing I notice is the structure: the text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the discovery process, the author suddenly shifts to describing the rivers and their comparison to the Euphrates, which might not be smoothly connected. Also, some sentences are very long and run-on, making it hard to follow the flow of ideas. There's a part where the author talks about the "Hanging Garden" and its features, but the connection to the Garden of Eden isn't clearly explained.

Another issue is the use of vague references. The author mentions "antldiluvians" and "antideluvians," which might be typos for "antediluvians" (people before the flood), but even if corrected, the context isn't always clear. The text also makes several assertions without sufficient evidence or logical progression, such as equating the Mississippi River to the Euphrates based on their names and flow, which might not be logically sound.

There's a section with a jumbled paragraph that seems like a list of disconnected phrases: "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had..." This part is incoherent and doesn't contribute to the argument. Similarly, the paragraph about "But possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed." is confusing and doesn't follow a logical structure.

The author also makes several comparisons and claims without clear transitions between them, such as moving from the geographical features to the presence of rattlesnakes as a "Serpent" symbol. While the symbolism might be intended, the connection isn't clearly explained, leading to a disjointed argument.

Additionally, the text ends with a description of the scenery and cities, which seems to drift from the main argument about the Garden of Eden. The final paragraphs don't tie back to the initial claim effectively, leaving the reader with a sense of fragmentation.

In terms of clarity, the author uses a lot of religious references and assumptions about the reader's familiarity with the Bible, which might not be clear to all readers. The logical flow from one idea to the next is sometimes abrupt, especially when making the case for the Garden of Eden's location based on geographical and symbolic similarities.

Considering all these points, the text has several coherence issues. The main problems are the lack of smooth transitions between ideas, the presence of incoherent or jumbled sections, and the disjointed structure that makes the argument hard to follow. These issues affect the overall coherence, making the text less effective in conveying the author's claim clearly and logically.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages and argumentative claims without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Weak logical connections between geographical descriptions and biblical claims (e.g., equating Mississippi to Euphrates based on superficial similarities)
- [CLARITY] Confusing jumbled sentences and fragments (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a..." paragraph)
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected paragraphs that don't follow logical progression (e.g., sudden shift to rattlesnakes as "Serpent" symbol)
- [COHERENCE] Inconsistent focus between geographical description, religious symbolism, and historical claims

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
