Let me analyze the text for coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text has a chapter titled "nothing" which is confusing and disrupts the logical structure of the story. The chapter should have a meaningful title.

2) [STRUCTURE] There are several grammatical errors and sentence fragments that make the text difficult to follow, especially in the first few paragraphs. For example, "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can" is incoherent.

3) [LOGIC] The text appears to be missing content between chapters. The first chapter ends with the family arriving at Canterville Chase, and the next chapter labeled "nothing" begins abruptly with "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred."

4) [TRANSITION] The transition between the first chapter and the "nothing" chapter is jarring and confusing. The narrative flow is interrupted without proper setup or explanation.

5) [CLARITY] Many sentences are written in a confusing or awkward manner that makes the meaning difficult to grasp. For example, "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed" is not grammatically correct.

6) [LOGIC] The story seems to jump between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions. For instance, the narrative shifts from the Otis family's arrival to the reappearance of the blood stain without clear chronology.

7) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous typographical errors and awkward phrasing that disrupt the reading experience and make the story less coherent.

8) [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a partial excerpt or has missing sections. The narrative begins with the Otis family buying Canterville Chase but then seems to jump to later events without covering all the necessary developments in between.

Based on these issues, I need to score the text for coherence on a scale from 1 to 5.

The text has significant coherence problems that make it difficult to follow the narrative. There are grammatical errors, sentence fragments, confusing transitions, and apparent missing content. The structure is disrupted by a chapter titled "nothing" and the narrative flow is often unclear.

However, the core story (the Otis family's experience with the Canterville Ghost) is somewhat recognizable and has a logical progression when the coherence issues are ignored.

Given these considerations, I would rate the coherence as a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort, but it does have some coherent elements and an identifiable narrative structure when the most serious issues are overlooked.
