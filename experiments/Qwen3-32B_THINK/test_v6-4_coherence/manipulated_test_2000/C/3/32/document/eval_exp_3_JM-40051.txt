Alright, I need to evaluate the coherence of the given text. Let me start by reading through it carefully to understand the main points and how they flow.

The text is about the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions to support this claim. 

First, I'll look for coherence issues. Coherence involves logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clarity, and a clear structure. 

Looking at the structure, the text starts with the author's motivation for publishing, then moves into biblical interpretations, and finally describes the geographical features. However, the flow seems a bit disjointed. The author jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the location in America, there's a sudden shift to the Mississippi River and its features without a clear link to the previous points.

There are also several instances of unclear transitions. For example, the mention of "the thing" and "stuff" is confusing. These phrases are used repeatedly but aren't defined, making it hard to follow the author's references. This lack of clarity disrupts the flow and makes the text harder to understand.

Another issue is the repetition and redundancy. The author frequently reiterates the significance of the location and the presence of the four rivers, which could be consolidated for better clarity. Additionally, some parts of the text are overly verbose, which can lead to confusion rather than clarity.

The logical sequencing is also problematic. The author presents a series of claims without sufficient evidence or logical progression. For instance, the argument that the Garden of Eden is in the Mississippi River valley is made without addressing counterarguments or providing a step-by-step reasoning process. This makes the argument less persuasive and the text less coherent.

There are also some abrupt shifts in focus. The text moves from discussing the geographical features to the presence of rattlesnakes and then to the city of La Crosse, which seems disconnected from the main argument. These shifts make it difficult to follow the author's intended narrative.

In terms of clarity, the use of undefined terms like "the thing" and "stuff" is a major issue. These terms are used throughout the text without explanation, leading to confusion. Additionally, some sentences are poorly constructed, making it hard to grasp the intended meaning. For example, "It is located on the stuff‚Äù of the Mississippi River..." is unclear without knowing what "stuff" refers to.

The conclusion of the text is also abrupt. The author ends with a description of the city of La Crosse but doesn't tie back to the main argument about the Garden of Eden. This leaves the reader without a clear resolution or summary of the points made.

Considering all these issues, the text has several coherence problems, including unclear transitions, undefined terms, repetition, and abrupt shifts in focus. These issues affect the overall flow and make the text harder to follow. However, the main argument is somewhat present, and the structure isn't entirely incoherent. Therefore, I would rate the coherence as a 3, as the text is generally coherent but has noticeable issues that affect the reading experience.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Frequent abrupt shifts between unrelated geographical descriptions and biblical interpretations without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Repeated use of undefined terms like "the thing" and "stuff" creating confusion
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent logical flow between claims about Garden of Eden location and supporting evidence
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitional phrases between major sections (e.g., sudden shift from flood narrative to Mississippi River description)
- [COHERENCE] Disconnected paragraphs about rattlesnakes and city descriptions that don't advance main argument

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
