I'll carefully analyze the text for coherence issues and then provide a rating on the 1-5 scale.

Looking at the text, I notice several coherence problems:

1) [LOGIC] The introduction mentions analyzing "Dickens's last plot" but then shifts to discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts without clearly connecting these topics.

2) [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing Bradley's career to a seemingly unrelated scene involving Stransom, Paul Creston, and Mary Antrim in London. This scene appears to be from a different story or novel.

3) [CLARITY] The text shifts from the introduction to a chapter about "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without a clear transition or explanation of how these sections relate.

4) [LOGIC] The introduction discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, but then the narrative shifts to a completely different story about a character named Stransom encountering someone in London, which appears unrelated to Bradley.

5) [STRUCTURE] The text contains what appears to be excerpts from multiple different sources or stories, creating a disjointed reading experience.

6) [LOGIC] There are references to "Sir Simon" and a blood-stain at the Chase that seem to be from a ghost story or mystery novel, which is completely unrelated to the rest of the text about Will Bradley.

7) [TRANSITION] The text transitions abruptly between different narrative threads without any connecting text or explanation.

8) [CLARITY] The text contains what appears to be a dialogue snippet that doesn't clearly connect to the rest of the narrative.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as a 2.5 on the coherence scale. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas. While there are some coherent sections about Will Bradley's life and career, the text is significantly disrupted by what appears to be unrelated narrative segments. The reader must make extra effort to understand the text, as the different narrative threads are not clearly connected or explained.
