Let me evaluate this text for coherence based on the provided criteria.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to understand its content and structure. The text appears to be an introduction to a book about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist, followed by a chapter about his early life as a printer in Ishpeming.

Now, I'll look for coherence issues:

1. The text jumps abruptly from the introduction to the biographical chapter about Bradley's childhood without any transitional sentence or paragraph. This creates a jarring shift in perspective and content.

2. The introduction discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts and his legacy, but the biographical chapter then shifts to a detailed, almost novelistic account of his childhood without clear connection to the themes in the introduction. The narrative style changes significantly between the two sections.

3. The childhood chapter is written in a very specific, detailed, and anecdotal style that feels more like a fictionalized biography than an objective introduction. It includes many specific details about Bradley's life (e.g., "you are six years old," "you are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston") that aren't clearly necessary for understanding his artistic legacy.

4. The text moves through time in a somewhat disjointed way. It starts with the introduction, then jumps to Bradley's childhood, and then seems to be heading toward his career development but doesn't complete this narrative arc.

5. Some of the details in the childhood chapter appear to be presented without sufficient context or explanation of how they relate to Bradley's later career as a graphic artist.

6. The writing style in the childhood chapter is somewhat inconsistent with the more analytical tone in the introduction. The shift in voice and approach affects the overall coherence of the text.

7. The text includes many specific historical and biographical details that may be interesting but don't always clearly contribute to the overall narrative or understanding of Bradley's impact on American graphic arts.

8. The flow between paragraphs in the childhood chapter is sometimes abrupt, with little or no transitional phrases to guide the reader through the sequence of events.

Based on these observations, I'll summarize the most serious coherence issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text has an abrupt transition between the analytical introduction and the detailed biographical chapter without any connecting narrative.
2) [COHESION] The childhood chapter is written in a very different style and tone from the introduction, creating a disconnect between the two sections.
3) [RELEVANCE] The childhood chapter includes many specific details that don't clearly connect to Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, which is the main topic of the introduction.
4) [PROGRESSION] The text lacks a clear narrative progression, jumping between different aspects of Bradley's life without a smooth transition.

For the final score, I would say this text is "mostly coherent" with some significant issues that affect the overall flow and understanding. The introduction is coherent on its own, and the childhood chapter is coherent within itself, but the transition between them and the relationship between the content and the stated purpose of the text are problematic.

I would rate this as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent within each section, but the transition between sections and the overall structure of the text have noticeable issues that affect the reading experience. The text has a clear purpose (introducing Will Bradley's work), but the biographical chapter, while well-written, doesn't clearly connect to this purpose in a coherent way.
