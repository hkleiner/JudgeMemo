I'll analyze the text for coherence issues and then provide a score based on the evaluation criteria.

First, I need to understand what the text is about. This appears to be a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author is examining whether the Church of England teaches the "Real Presence" doctrine (that Christ is physically present in the bread and wine of communion) or if it teaches a more symbolic/spiritual presence.

Now I'll look for coherence issues in the text:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, with no clear organization beyond the chapter headings. It jumps between different aspects of the doctrine without clear transitions.
2) [LOGIC] The author makes numerous assertions without providing clear logical connections between them. For example, they claim the Church of England doesn't teach the Real Presence but don't always clearly explain how they arrive at this conclusion from the documents they cite.
3) [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and verbose, with complex sentences that are difficult to follow. The author uses theological jargon without explanation for readers who may not be familiar with it.
4) [REPEATED IDEAS] The author frequently repeats the same points about the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice without adding new information or insights.
5) [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections. The author often introduces new ideas without connecting them to the previous content.
6) [COHERENCE] The overall structure lacks a clear narrative flow. The author moves back and forth between different arguments and documents without a consistent thread.
7) [FOCUS] The text sometimes veers off-topic, with emotional language about the Church's current state and attacks on opponents rather than maintaining focus on the doctrinal analysis.
8) [ORGANIZATION] The logical progression of ideas is often unclear. The author introduces concepts without always returning to them in a coherent sequence.
9) [CONSISTENCY] There are inconsistencies in how the author presents their arguments, sometimes contradicting themselves in different sections.
10) [READABILITY] The text is generally difficult to read due to its length, density, and complex sentence structures.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of the text as a 3. The text is generally coherent in its overall argument but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience. While the author has a clear central argument, the presentation is often disorganized and lacks the smooth progression that would make the content more accessible and persuasive.

The text does have a clear structure in terms of chapters and sections, but within those sections, the flow of ideas is often disjointed. The author frequently makes assertions without clearly supporting them with evidence from the documents they cite. The complex theological language and long, dense paragraphs make it difficult for readers to follow the argument.

The most serious problems are the lack of clear logical connections between ideas, the frequent repetition of points, and the abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections. These issues make the text more challenging to follow and reduce its overall coherence.

I'll now format my answer according to the requested format.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational structure beyond the chapter headings, with abrupt transitions between sections and topics.
- [LOGIC] The author makes numerous assertions without clearly explaining the logical connections between them or providing sufficient evidence for their claims.
- [CLARITY] The text is often verbose and uses complex theological jargon without explanation, making it difficult for many readers to follow.
- [REPEATED IDEAS] The author frequently repeats the same points about the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice without adding new information or insights.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections without clear connections to the previous content.
- [COHERENCE] The overall narrative flow is unclear, with the author moving back and forth between different arguments and documents without a consistent thread.
- [FOCUS] The text sometimes veers off-topic with emotional language about the Church's current state and attacks on opponents rather than maintaining focus on the doctrinal analysis.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

The text has a clear central argument about the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Real Presence, but its presentation is often disorganized and difficult to follow. While the author maintains a focus on the subject matter, the frequent repetition, lack of clear logical connections, and abrupt transitions between ideas and sections reduce the overall coherence. The complex theological language and long, dense paragraphs make the content more challenging to follow.
