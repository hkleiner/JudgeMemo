I need to evaluate the coherence of this long text about Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer. Let me first understand what coherence means in this context:

**Coherence** assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, looking at:
- Logical sequencing of ideas
- Smooth connections between ideas
- Clear progression from one section to another
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps
- Consistent and clear structure of the narrative

Now I'll read through the text and identify any issues that might affect its coherence:

The text is structured as a biography of Will Bradley, written in a somewhat narrative style with multiple chapters covering different periods of his life and career. The text appears to be a memoir or biography written by or about Will Bradley, with some editorial additions at the end.

Let me analyze for coherence issues:

1. **Structure**: The text is divided into chapters with clear titles, which provides a good structural foundation. The chapters generally follow a chronological progression through Bradley's life.

2. **Logical sequencing**: The chapters generally follow a logical chronological order, moving from Bradley's childhood to his retirement. However, some chapters jump between different periods without clear transitions.

3. **Smooth connections**: There are some abrupt transitions between sections and chapters. For example, the text jumps from the introduction to the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter without clear transition.

4. **Progression**: The overall narrative progresses chronologically, which is logical for a biography. However, the writing style is sometimes disjointed, with the narrative voice shifting between first-person and third-person in different sections.

5. **Ambiguities and jumps**: There are some instances where the narrative jumps in time or context without clear indication. For example, the text sometimes moves from one event to another without clear temporal markers.

6. **Consistency**: The narrative voice is inconsistent - it shifts between first-person (using "you" and "Will") and third-person ("Bradley did this," "Bradley was...") in different sections. This inconsistency can confuse the reader about the perspective.

7. **Repetition**: There is some repetition of information across different chapters, particularly in the "Chronology" and "Afterword" sections that summarize information already covered in the main text.

Based on this analysis, I'll identify the most significant coherence issues:

[STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, consistent narrative structure with smooth transitions between chapters and sections. The organization could be improved with better transitions.

[LOGIC] Some sections jump in time or context without clear explanation or transition, making the narrative flow less smooth.

[CLARITY] The narrative voice is inconsistent, shifting between first-person and third-person in different sections, which can confuse the reader.

[STRUCTURE] The "Chronology" and "Afterword" sections at the end repeat information already covered in the main text, which is redundant.

[TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between chapters and sections, particularly between the introduction and the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter.

[COHERENCE] The overall narrative is generally coherent, following a chronological structure, but could benefit from more consistent transitions and a more unified narrative voice.

Now I'll assign a final score based on the evaluation criteria:

The text is generally coherent, following a logical chronological structure that makes sense for a biography. However, the inconsistent narrative voice, abrupt transitions between sections, and some repetition of information affect the overall coherence. The text is readable and the narrative is generally clear, but these issues prevent it from being highly coherent.

Given these considerations, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text has a clear overall structure but suffers from some noticeable coherence issues that affect the reading experience.

Let me double-check my assessment and ensure I'm following the requested format correctly.
