I'll evaluate the coherence of this text according to the criteria provided. Let me first understand the text and identify any coherence issues.

The text appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. It's written in a narrative style with several chapters. Let me analyze the coherence issues:

1) Coherence Issues:
   [LOGIC] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Millet's painting to Will Bradley's childhood without clear connection.
   [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is inconsistent. Some chapters follow a chronological pattern while others jump around in time.
   [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between different topics and time periods without proper connecting sentences.
   [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are unclear in their purpose and how they relate to the overall narrative.
   [LOGIC] The text sometimes discusses unrelated topics within the same paragraph, making it hard to follow the main narrative thread.
   [STRUCTURE] The book has a confusing structure with multiple chapters that don't always build on each other in a logical way.
   [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections are often abrupt and lack context.
   [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new ideas or concepts without proper setup or explanation.
   [CLARITY] The narrative voice shifts between first-person and third-person without clear indication.
   [LOGIC] Some sections appear to be cut-and-pasted from different sources, creating a disjointed reading experience.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as follows:

The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.

This corresponds to a score of 2 on the provided scale.
