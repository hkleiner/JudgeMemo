Let me carefully analyze the text for coherence issues.

First, I'll read through the text to understand its main content and structure:

The text is a theological treatise examining whether the Church of England teaches the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Eucharist. It's divided into chapters:
- Introduction
- The Real Presence
- Adoration
- Sacrifice

The author is analyzing church documents (Articles of Religion, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies) to determine what the Church of England actually teaches about the Eucharist.

Now I'll look for coherence issues:

1) Structure:
- The text has a clear structure with chapters and a logical flow of ideas within each chapter.
- However, there are some strange and unrelated passages that seem out of place in a theological treatise about the Eucharist.

2) Transitions:
- The flow between sections is mostly logical, as the author is methodically examining different aspects of the Church's teaching.
- However, there are some jarring transitions where unrelated content appears.

3) Logic:
- The core argument is logically presented, with the author methodically examining different documents.
- However, the inclusion of unrelated content disrupts the logical flow.

4) Consistency:
- The main topic is consistently addressed throughout the text.
- However, the random insertion of unrelated passages breaks this consistency.

5) Irrelevant content:
- There are several passages that seem completely out of place in a theological treatise about the Eucharist:
  - A passage about "The Doctrine of the Real Presence" in the context of "Jasper" and "opium hag, the Princess Puffer" (seems to be from a Dickens novel)
  - A passage about Millet's painting "The Sower"
  - A passage about "EXCALIBUR" as a dog
  - A passage about a newspaper article about "Sir Acton Hague"
  - A passage about a man named George Stransom
  - A passage about "The Pall Mall"
  - A passage about a man asking if someone came on a tandem
  - A passage about a man named Mr. Slinkton and Margaret
  - A passage about "most societies with a moral aim"
  - A passage about "3. The spirit of man, that is, the vital spirit, life, soul."
  - A passage about "3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is stopped."

These random passages disrupt the coherence of the text and make it difficult to follow the main argument.

6) Ambiguity:
- While the main theological argument is clear, the purpose of the random inserted passages is ambiguous.

7) Repetition:
- There is some repetition in the main argument, but it's not excessive.

Now I'll summarize the most serious coherence problems:

1) [STRUCTURE] Random and unrelated passages are inserted into the theological treatise, disrupting the overall structure and coherence.

2) [TRANSITION] The transitions between the theological content and the random inserted passages are jarring and unexplained.

3) [LOGIC] The logic of the text is disrupted by the inclusion of unrelated content that has no connection to the main argument about the Eucharist.

4) [CONSISTENCY] The consistency of the text is broken by the random insertion of passages from different contexts and topics.

5) [CLARITY] The clarity of the text is reduced by the presence of irrelevant content that confuses the reader.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text. The main theological argument is coherent and well-structured, but the inclusion of unrelated content significantly disrupts the overall coherence. While the core argument about the Church of England's teaching on the Eucharist is coherent, the random inserted passages make the text as a whole less coherent than it could be.

I would give this text a coherence score of 3.5 out of 5. It has a clear structure and logical flow in the main argument, but the random inserted content significantly disrupts the coherence of the text as a whole.
