Let me carefully analyze the text for coherence issues.

First, I'll read through the text to understand its content and structure. This appears to be a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's structured with an introduction and three main chapters (Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice), with each chapter discussing different aspects of the doctrine.

Now, I'll look for coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria:

**Coherence** assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:

1) [LOGIC] There are numerous instances where the author refers to "the thing" instead of "the Church of England," which is confusing and breaks the logical flow of the text.

2) [LOGIC] The author frequently uses the phrase "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England," which is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the logical progression.

3) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous instances of unclear or ambiguous references, such as "the thing" and "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England," making it difficult to follow the argument.

4) [STRUCTURE] While the text has a clear structure with introduction and three chapters, the internal structure of some sections is somewhat repetitive, with the author reiterating the same points multiple times.

5) [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument.

6) [CONSISTENCY] The author's use of inconsistent terminology (referring to "the thing" and "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England") creates confusion and disrupts the coherence of the text.

7) [LOGIC] There are some logical gaps in the argument, particularly in how the author connects the various points about the Church of England's doctrine.

Now, I'll summarize the most serious problems that justify point deductions:

1) [LOGIC] Repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England" throughout the text, which is grammatically incorrect and creates confusion.

2) [CLARITY] The text contains numerous instances of unclear or ambiguous references, making it difficult to follow the argument.

3) [STRUCTURE] Some sections contain repetitive content, weakening the overall coherence of the argument.

4) [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear, disrupting the logical flow.

5) [CONSISTENCY] The inconsistent terminology (using "the thing" and "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England") creates confusion and disrupts the coherence of the text.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2.5. The text has a clear structure with an introduction and three chapters, but the repeated use of incorrect terminology ("the thing" and "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England") significantly disrupts the coherence. These errors make it difficult to follow the argument and create confusion. While the author makes some logical progressions, the frequent terminology errors and occasional abrupt transitions significantly reduce the overall coherence. The content is generally organized, but the persistent terminology issues prevent it from being more coherent.

Let me double-check my assessment to ensure I'm not missing anything:

- The text has a clear structure with an introduction and three chapters.
- The author makes logical progressions in discussing the Church of England's doctrine.
- However, the repeated use of incorrect terminology ("the thing" and "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England") is a major issue that significantly disrupts the coherence.
- The text contains some logical gaps and occasional abrupt transitions.
- The content is generally organized and the author presents a clear argument, but the terminology issues severely impact the overall coherence.

I believe my assessment of 2.5 is appropriate for this text.
