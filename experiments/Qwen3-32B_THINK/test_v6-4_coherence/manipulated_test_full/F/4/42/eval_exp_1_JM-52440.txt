I need to evaluate the coherence of this text. Let me first understand what the text is about and how it's structured.

This appears to be a theological work discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's structured as a book with an introduction followed by three main chapters: Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The author is examining whether the Church of England teaches the doctrine of the Real Presence (i.e., that Christ is physically present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist).

Now, let me evaluate the coherence of this text according to the criteria provided:

1. Logical sequencing and progression: The text follows a clear structure - introduction followed by three main chapters. Each chapter addresses a specific aspect of the doctrine. The author presents his argument in a logical sequence.

2. Non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas: The text is generally non-repetitive, though there are some recurring themes and phrases throughout. The ideas are connected logically, but there are occasional abrupt shifts in focus.

3. Clear progression from one section to another: The text does show clear progression from the introduction to the three main chapters, and within each chapter there's a logical development of ideas.

4. Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps: There are some ambiguities and occasional abrupt shifts in the text, particularly in the way arguments are presented and refuted.

5. Consistent and clear structure: The text has a consistent structure with clear headings and a logical flow.

Now let me identify specific coherence issues:

1. [LOGIC] The text occasionally presents arguments in a circular manner, using the same points to support multiple conclusions without clearly distinguishing them.
2. [CLARITY] Some passages are overly complex and dense with theological terminology, making them difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the subject.
3. [STRUCTURE] While the overall structure is logical, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections that could be smoother.
4. [COHERENCE] The text sometimes shifts between addressing the reader directly and presenting more objective theological analysis without clear transitions.
5. [LOGIC] The author occasionally presents counterarguments without clearly distinguishing them from his own position, which can create confusion.
6. [CLARITY] Some passages use archaic language and complex sentence structures that reduce clarity.
7. [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes strong assertions without sufficient explanation of the reasoning behind them.
8. [COHERENCE] There are occasional shifts in tone and style that could be more consistent throughout the text.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 4. It's mostly coherent with a clear structure and logical progression, but there are some issues with clarity, occasional abrupt transitions, and complex language that could affect the reading experience.

Let me review my evaluation again to ensure it's accurate:

The text has a clear structure and generally follows a logical progression. The author presents his argument systematically, addressing each of the three main topics (Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice) in separate chapters. The arguments are generally well-structured within each section.

However, there are some issues with clarity, particularly in the dense theological language and complex sentence structures. There are also occasional abrupt transitions between paragraphs and some circular reasoning in the arguments. The author sometimes presents counterarguments without clearly distinguishing them from his own position, which can create confusion.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent but has some issues that would make it less accessible to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.

I believe a score of 4 is appropriate for this text. It's mostly coherent with a clear structure and logical progression, but has some issues with clarity, transitions, and argumentation that prevent it from being fully coherent.
