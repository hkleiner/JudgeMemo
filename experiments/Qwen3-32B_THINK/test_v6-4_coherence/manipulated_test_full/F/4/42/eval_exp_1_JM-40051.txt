Alright, let's take a look at this text and assess its coherence. The author is making a claim that a specific location in the United States is the Garden of Eden, based on their interpretation of the Bible and the geography of the area. 

First, I'll look for logical sequencing and how ideas connect. The text starts with the author's personal journey in making this discovery, then moves into a detailed description of the geography, comparing it to biblical descriptions. However, the flow between these sections is a bit disjointed. The author jumps from their personal motivations to a lengthy description of the landscape, then to historical and scientific claims, and back again.

I notice some repetition in the argumentation. The author repeatedly emphasizes that this location matches the biblical description, but the evidence is presented in a somewhat circular manner without clear logical progression. There are also some abrupt shifts in perspective and topic. For example, the text suddenly introduces a lawyer's challenge about the devil being present, which seems disconnected from the main argument.

The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often weak. The author doesn't use transitional phrases to guide the reader through the argument. Instead, they jump from one point to another, sometimes within the same paragraph. This makes it difficult to follow the overall argument and how the different pieces of evidence connect.

There are also some unclear or ambiguous statements. For instance, the author makes claims about geological formations and their significance without providing clear explanations of how these relate to the Garden of Eden. The text is filled with specific geographical details, but the connections between these details and the main argument are not always clear.

The structure of the text is somewhat haphazard. It seems to be a collection of different sections that were written at different times and then compiled together. There's no clear organization that guides the reader from one idea to the next in a logical sequence. The author also includes a lot of tangential information, such as descriptions of local landmarks and historical anecdotes, which don't necessarily contribute to the main argument.

Another issue is the lack of resolution for some of the claims. The author presents several arguments but doesn't address potential counterarguments or provide a comprehensive conclusion that ties everything together. This leaves the reader with an incomplete understanding of the argument.

In terms of clarity, the text is often verbose and filled with unnecessary details. The author uses a lot of descriptive language, but this can be overwhelming and detracts from the main points. The writing style is also somewhat informal and lacks the precision needed to make a convincing argument.

Overall, while the author has a clear thesis, the execution of the argument is flawed in terms of coherence. The text lacks a clear structure, logical progression, and effective transitions, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument and understand how the different pieces of evidence support the main claim.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between personal anecdotes, geographical descriptions, and speculative arguments.  
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning and repetitive claims without clear progression or resolution.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak or absent transitions between paragraphs and sections, creating a fragmented reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous connections between evidence (e.g., geological claims) and the central argument about Eden.  
- [COHERENCE] Overly verbose and meandering descriptions that dilute the main thesis.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
