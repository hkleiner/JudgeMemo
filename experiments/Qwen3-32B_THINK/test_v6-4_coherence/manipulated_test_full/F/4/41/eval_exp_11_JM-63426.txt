Alright, I'm going to evaluate the text according to the coherence criteria. I'll first read through the text carefully to understand the content and structure, then identify any coherence issues that would lead to a score deduction.

The text is a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer, covering his life and career. It's structured in chapters that chronologically follow his life from childhood to retirement. The text has a somewhat narrative and nostalgic tone, with a mix of personal anecdotes, historical context, and reflections on the printing and design industry.

Now I'll look for coherence issues:

1. **Non-sequiturs and abrupt shifts**: Are there any sudden transitions between ideas that don't flow logically?
2. **Repetitions**: Does the text repeat information unnecessarily?
3. **Ambiguities**: Are there unclear references or confusing statements?
4. **Inconsistencies**: Does the text contradict itself or have conflicting information?
5. **Unsmooth transitions**: Are there parts where the flow between sections or paragraphs is jarring?

Looking at the text, I notice a few potential issues:

- The text has a somewhat disjointed structure, with some chapters jumping back and forth in time or perspective.
- Some sections appear to be written in the first person ("You are six years old; next month you will be seven") while others are in the third person.
- There are some unclear transitions between paragraphs, particularly in the early chapters.
- The text contains a mix of narrative and expository writing styles that don't always blend smoothly.
- There are occasional repetitions of information, such as details about the Wayside Press and Bradley's work with Caslon typefaces.
- Some paragraphs start with new ideas without sufficient setup or transition from the previous content.
- The text has some typographical errors and inconsistencies in spelling, punctuation, and formatting that could affect coherence.

Based on these observations, I'll identify the most significant coherence issues in the text.

Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between first-person narrative ("You are six years old") and third-person biography in the same chapter  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed flow between childhood anecdotes and detailed professional history without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] Unclear temporal references with phrases like "Now his retirement has lasted almost as long as his active career" without establishing timeline  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent narrative perspective switching between present-tense descriptions and past-tense accounts  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jumps between unrelated topics within paragraphs (e.g., from printing techniques to personal anecdotes)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to specific events without sufficient context (e.g., "the trial took place in Marquette, Michigan, and Mr. Roosevelt won a verdict of six cents")  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of key career milestones across multiple chapters without clear progression  
- [LOGIC] Confusing chronology in the "Chronology" section that contradicts the narrative in previous chapters  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
The text has a generally coherent structure as a biography, but suffers from inconsistent narrative perspective, abrupt transitions between topics, and some confusing chronology. The first-person narrative sections in early chapters create dissonance with the later third-person account. While the overall arc of Bradley's life is clear, the frequent shifts in perspective and some logical jumps affect the smooth flow of the narrative. The detailed technical descriptions of printing processes are well-integrated, but the personal anecdotes and historical context sometimes feel disconnected. The text remains readable and informative, but the coherence issues prevent it from achieving a higher score.
