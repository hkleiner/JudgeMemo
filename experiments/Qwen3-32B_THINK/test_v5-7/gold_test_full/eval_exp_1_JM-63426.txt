Let me carefully evaluate the text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, I'll examine the text for fluency issues:

1. Grammar: The text is written in a complex, archaic style with elaborate sentence structures. While this is stylistically appropriate for the subject matter (a biography of a historical figure), I need to check for actual grammatical errors.
2. Spelling: I need to check for any misspelled words.
3. Syntax: The text uses complex sentences with multiple clauses. I need to check if these are structured properly.
4. Lexicon: The text uses a rich vocabulary appropriate for the subject matter, but I need to check if any words are misused or if there are inconsistencies in terminology.
5. Common English usage: I need to check if the text follows standard English conventions.

Now for coherence issues:

1. Logic: I need to check if the ideas in the text follow a logical progression.
2. Structure: I need to check if the text is organized in a way that makes sense and if the flow of information is appropriate.
3. Clarity: I need to check if the text is clear and if the meaning is easy to understand.
4. Transitions: I need to check if the text has smooth transitions between ideas and paragraphs.

Let me now analyze the text:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] The text uses complex sentence structures that are generally grammatically correct, but some sentences are very long and could be clearer. For example: "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably."
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have awkward phrasing, such as "Your mother is troubled. Finally she says, 'Perhaps it will be for the best.'"
- [SPELLING] I don't notice any spelling errors in the text.
- [SYNTAX] The text has many long, complex sentences that can be difficult to follow. For example: "You are now back with R-M staying half an hour at night and getting to work a half hour earlier in the morning and all is well with the world."
- [LEXICON] The text uses a rich vocabulary, but some words are archaic or obscure, which may affect readability for modern readers.
- [COMMON USAGE] The text uses some expressions that are not common in modern English, such as "You are six years old; next month you will be seven."

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text is a biography of Will Bradley, and the narrative generally follows a logical chronological order.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into chapters that follow a logical progression through Bradley's life, but some chapters are quite long and could be more clearly segmented.
- [CLARITY] The text is generally clear, but some sentences are complex and may be difficult to understand.
- [TRANSITION] The text has some abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs, especially between different periods in Bradley's life.
- [CONSISTENCY] The text sometimes shifts between first-person and third-person narration, which can be confusing.
- [TENSE] The text has some inconsistencies in verb tense, with the author sometimes using present tense to describe past events and vice versa.

Based on this analysis, I'll provide my evaluation:

Fluency Score: The text has some grammatical issues and complex sentence structures that can make it difficult to read at times, but it's generally well-written with minimal errors. I would rate it a 4.

Coherence Score: The text has a logical structure and follows a chronological narrative, but some of the transitions between ideas and paragraphs are abrupt. The shifts between first-person and third-person narration can also be confusing. I would rate it a 3.5.
