Okay, I need to evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding the text. It's a long essay claiming that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific area in the US, using biblical references and geographical descriptions. 

First, for fluency issues. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon problems. The text has some typos like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," and "admirirg" instead of "admiring." There are also some awkward phrases and run-on sentences. For example, "But by degrees it has  been opening to the minds of some..." has an extra space. Also, some sentences are too long and lack proper punctuation, making them hard to follow. The author uses words like "veritable" and "euphony" which might be a bit forced. 

Next, coherence. The text is trying to connect biblical descriptions with a specific location, but the flow is sometimes jarring. The author jumps between different points without smooth transitions. For example, after discussing the geographical features, they suddenly bring up a historical figure or a place, which might confuse the reader. The structure is a bit meandering, with multiple digressions and a lack of clear organization. The argument is presented in a very assertive tone without much logical progression, making it hard to follow the main points.

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, the text has several spelling and grammatical errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few run-on sentences. However, it's mostly readable. I'd say a 3.5. For coherence, the argument is presented in a disjointed manner with abrupt shifts and unclear connections. The reader has to work to follow the logic, so a 2.5 seems appropriate.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" - [SPELLING] "dimentions" instead of "dimensions" - [SPELLING] "admirirg" instead of "admiring" - [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with missing commas or periods, e.g., "But by degrees it has  been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent..." - [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or overly elaborate words ("veritable," "euphony") that disrupt natural phrasing - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues, e.g., "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with..." - [PUNCTUATION] Missing spaces in phrases like "has  been opening" - [CLARITY] Awkward phrasing like "as well as the adaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot" 

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between topics (geography, biblical interpretation, personal anecdotes) - [LOGIC] Weak logical connections between claims about geography and biblical interpretation - [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs and ideas - [CLARITY] Confusing use of first-person narrative interspersed with grandiose assertions - [ORGANIZATION] Meandering argument structure without clear thesis development - [PERSUASION] Overly assertive tone without sufficient evidence for claims - [FOCUS] Excessive tangents about local landmarks that don't support the central argument 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5 
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
