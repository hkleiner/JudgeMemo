Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency issues. Fluency relates to the quality of individual sentences, focusing on grammar, non-repetitive structure, and adherence to common English usage with clear meaning.

Looking at the text, I notice several areas where fluency might be compromised:

1) [GRAMMAR] There are instances of grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. For example, the text has complex sentences with multiple clauses that sometimes become confusing.

2) [REPETITION] The text occasionally repeats phrases or ideas without adding new information, which can make the writing feel redundant.

3) [STYLE] The writing style is quite formal and archaic, which might not be typical for modern English but isn't necessarily a fluency issue per se. However, it can sometimes make the meaning less clear to contemporary readers.

4) [PASSIVE VOICE] The text uses a lot of passive voice, which can make the writing feel less direct and engaging.

Now, for coherence issues. Coherence relates to how well the sentences and ideas connect to form a unified whole.

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into chapters and sections, which helps with coherence. However, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

2) [LOGIC] The argument follows a logical progression through the three main topics: the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The author methodically examines each topic using the Church's documents as evidence.

3) [FOCUS] The text maintains a clear focus on the central question of whether the Church of England teaches the Real Presence doctrine.

4) [CLARITY] Some of the theological discussions can be complex and dense, which might make the text less accessible to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.

5) [PACING] The text is quite lengthy and dense, which could affect its readability and coherence for some readers.

For the final fluency score, I need to consider how many and how severe the fluency issues are. The text is generally well-written with complex but mostly correct grammar. The archaic style might be considered less fluent by modern standards, but it's consistent throughout. There are some awkward phrasings but nothing that would severely hinder understanding.

For the final coherence score, I need to assess how well the text holds together as a whole. The structure is logical and the argument is well-organized, with clear transitions between major sections. The text maintains a consistent focus on its central question, though some readers might find the density of theological discussion challenging.

Based on these observations, I would assign the following scores:
- Fluency: 4 (mostly fluent with some minor issues in phrasing and style)
- Coherence: 4 (well-organized with logical progression, though dense in places)

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some complex sentences have awkward phrasing that could be simplified for clarity.
- [REPETITION] Occasional repetition of phrases and ideas without adding new information.
- [STYLE] The archaic and formal writing style, while consistent, may feel less fluent to modern readers.
- [PASSIVE VOICE] Frequent use of passive voice makes the writing less direct in places.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is logical with clear chapters, but some paragraph transitions could be smoother.
- [LOGIC] The argument follows a clear logical progression through the three main topics.
- [FOCUS] The text maintains a consistent focus on its central question.
- [CLARITY] The theological discussions are dense and complex, which might make the text less accessible.
- [PACING] The text is lengthy and dense, which could affect readability for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5 
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
