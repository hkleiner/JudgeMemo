Let me analyze the provided text according to the evaluation criteria. This appears to be an academic-style analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang.

First, I'll evaluate fluency issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
- [GRAMMAR] There are some minor grammatical issues, such as missing articles ("In April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by...") and inconsistent verb tenses.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and complex, making them slightly difficult to follow, especially in the more analytical sections.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the academic tone, though some archaic or uncommon words might be confusing to modern readers (e.g., "cramped monotony," "fulsome protestations").
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and ellipses.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with an introduction, analysis of the story, theories of the mystery, and a conclusion.
- [LOGIC] The logical flow is generally good, with the author presenting his arguments and evidence in a coherent manner.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are less clear due to the complexity of the arguments and the amount of detail provided.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are generally smooth, though some shifts in focus could be more clearly marked.

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores:

For fluency: The text has some minor grammatical issues and a few awkward phrasings, but overall it is quite fluent for an academic analysis. I would rate it a 4.0.

For coherence: The text is generally coherent with a clear structure and logical flow, though some sections could be clearer. I would rate it a 4.5.

Now I'll format my response according to the specified output format.

- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em dashes, ellipses, and quotation marks.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Clear academic structure with introduction, analysis, theories, and conclusion.  
- [LOGIC] Logical flow is generally good, with arguments presented in a coherent manner.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are less clear due to complex arguments and dense analysis.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections are generally smooth, though some shifts in focus could be better marked.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
