I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence. Let me carefully read through it and identify issues.

First, let me understand the content. This is a long text by someone claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in what is now Wisconsin and Minnesota in the United States. The author describes a specific geographical area along the Mississippi River and makes various arguments about why this is the location of the Garden of Eden as described in the Bible.

Now, I'll analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

FLUENCY ISSUES:
- [GRAMMAR]: There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "have ventured to publish it." should be "I have ventured to publish it." or "We have ventured to publish it." The subject is missing.
- [GRAMMAR]: "have been opening to the minds of some" - the verb tense is inconsistent.
- [SPELLING]: There are many misspelled words: "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "destitute of money mineral wealth" instead of "destitute of monetary mineral wealth", "scintific" instead of "scientific", "scintist" instead of "scientist", "acclimate" instead of "acclimatize" or "acclimated", "euphony" instead of "euphony" (though this might be correct), "euphonious" instead of "euphonious" (correct), "jageed" instead of "jagged", "beatiful" instead of "beautiful", "inclosing" instead of "enclosing", "tao" instead of "gap", "tao and the rich man" instead of "gap between the rich and the poor", "tao" is repeated in several places.
- [SYNTAX]: The text has many run-on sentences and sentence fragments. For example: "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream." This is a very long sentence that should be broken into multiple sentences for clarity.
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are issues with punctuation, including missing commas, incorrect use of dashes, and inconsistent use of quotation marks.
- [SPELLING]: There are repeated spelling errors for the same words: "rivers" is often misspelled as "rivers" (correct) and "rivers" (incorrectly capitalized or punctuated).
