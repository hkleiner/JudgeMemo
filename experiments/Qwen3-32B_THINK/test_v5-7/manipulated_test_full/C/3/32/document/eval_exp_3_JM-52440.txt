I'll evaluate the given text according to the evaluation criterion provided. Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues first.

### Fluency Issues:
The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. I'll identify issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexis:

1) [GRAMMAR] There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied..." where "a stuff" seems to be a placeholder or error.
2) [GRAMMAR] "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to a thing more or less upon the subject..." appears to be a grammatical error with the word "a thing".
3) [GRAMMAR] "the twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such change in the thing." "The thing" seems to be a placeholder.
4) [GRAMMAR] "the twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such change in the thing." "The thing" seems to be a placeholder.
5) [GRAMMAR] "And if this be the only theory on which it can be maintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the doctrine of the Church." This sentence has awkward phrasing.
6) [GRAMMAR] "The stuff honest men will be ready to cry 'shame' on those who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain and incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation." "The stuff" appears to be a placeholder.
7) [GRAMMAR] "It is my conviction that this looseness in the use of the word 'Sacrament' had led to great confusion..." should be "has led" instead of "had led".
8) [GRAMMAR] "Now I am quite prepared to admit that when this Advertisement was written, the writer of it did believe that the body and blood of our blessed Lord was present..." "Was" should be "were" to match "body and blood".
9) [GRAMMAR] "But there is another passage sometimes quoted from the Homily, and quoted with great assurance by those who desire to represent the Church of England as teaching the doctrine of the real presence." The phrasing is awkward.
10) [GRAMMAR] "He must have known the date, and must have been perfectly acquainted with the changes which took place five years after it." The sentence is awkwardly phrased.
11) [GRAMMAR] "The Reformers knew well enough what Rome meant by 'transubstantiation,' and the twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such change in the thing." "The thing" appears to be a placeholder.
12) [GRAMMAR] "I am not ignorant that an attempt has been made to represent this Article as referring to the abuses which had gathered around the sacrifice of the mass, and not against the principle of sacrifice itself." The sentence is overly complex and awkward.

### Coherence Issues:
The text is a theological treatise with a clear structure, but I'll identify issues related to logic, structure, clarity, and transitions:

1) [LOGIC] The text makes several theological assertions without providing sufficient evidence or logical support for some of its claims.
2) [LOGIC] There are moments where the argument seems to rely more on emotional appeal than logical reasoning.
3) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different points without clear transitions, making it sometimes difficult to follow the flow of the argument.
4) [CLARITY] Some theological concepts are presented in a way that could be clearer, especially for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
5) [LOGIC] The text sometimes assumes a position without adequately explaining or justifying it.
6) [LOGIC] There are moments where the argument seems to beg the question, assuming what it's trying to prove.
7) [CLARITY] Some of the theological terminology is used without clear definitions, which could confuse readers.
8) [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes broad generalizations about groups of people (e.g., "Ritualists") without sufficient evidence.
9) [LOGIC] The argument occasionally relies on appeals to authority rather than logical reasoning.
10) [CLARITY] Some of the sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better clarity.
11) [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents one-sided arguments without addressing counterpoints.
12) [LOGIC] Some of the historical claims appear to be presented as facts without sufficient evidence.

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criterion:

### Fluency Score:
The text is generally readable and follows a logical structure, but contains several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some unclear references. The frequent use of "the thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders is particularly problematic. These issues affect the readability and clarity of the text.

Considering the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal grammatical issues
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple grammatical issues
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible

Given the issues I identified, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical and phrasing issues that interrupt the flow and clarity.

### Coherence Score:
The text has a clear structure and follows a logical progression in discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. However, there are moments of unclear reasoning, emotional appeals, and one-sided arguments that affect the overall coherence. The text could benefit from better transitions between points and more balanced arguments.

Considering the scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent with clear logical progression
- Score 4: Mostly coherent with a few weak parts
- Score 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies
- Score 1: Largely incoherent

Given the issues I identified, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable shifts in reasoning and some logical inconsistencies.

Now, I'll format my final answer according to the instructions.
