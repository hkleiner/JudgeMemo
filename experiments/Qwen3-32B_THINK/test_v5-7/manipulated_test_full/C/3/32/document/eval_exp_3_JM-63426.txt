I need to evaluate the given text based on two criteria: fluency and coherence. I'll start by carefully reading through the text and identifying any issues.

First, let's understand what we're looking at. This appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer, written in a somewhat literary style. The text is quite long, with multiple chapters describing various periods of Bradley's life and career.

Now, let's evaluate for fluency issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
- [GRAMMAR] There are occasional grammatical errors, such as missing articles ("In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference") and incorrect verb forms.
- [SPELLING] There are some potential spelling issues, but they're not immediately obvious upon a quick scan.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are complex and could be clearer. For example: "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably."
- [LEXICON] There are repeated instances of "the stuff" and "a stuff" where specific locations or names should be. This appears to be a placeholder or error.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues, such as missing periods at the end of some sentences and inconsistent use of quotation marks.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
- [LOGIC] The text is generally logical in its progression through Bradley's life, but some transitions between sections are abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is generally sound, with chapters organized chronologically. However, the frequent use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" disrupts the flow and makes it difficult to follow.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are less clear due to the placeholder phrases and some complex sentence structures.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between some paragraphs and sections could be smoother.
- [CONSISTENCY] There is some inconsistency in tense usage, particularly in the later chapters where the narrative shifts between first-person and second-person.

Now, I'll rate the text based on the given scales:

For fluency:
- The text is generally readable and well-structured, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- The frequent use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" is a significant issue that affects fluency.
- There are occasional grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing.

For coherence:
- The text has a clear chronological structure through Bradley's life.
- However, the placeholder phrases ("the stuff", "a stuff") disrupt the flow and make it difficult to follow specific locations and events.
- The narrative shifts between first-person and second-person in some sections.
- Some transitions between paragraphs and chapters could be smoother.

Based on these observations, I'll provide my final ratings:

FLUENCY: I would rate this around a 2.5 - it's generally readable but contains frequent issues that disrupt comprehension.
COHERENCE: I would rate this around a 3 - it has a clear structure but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments due to the placeholder phrases.

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" throughout the text where specific locations/names should be, creating confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Some complex sentence structures that are difficult to follow, such as: "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings."
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions in several places, like "In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference."
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and missing periods at the end of some sentences.
- [SPELLING] Occasional misspellings or typographical errors, though not frequent enough to be a major issue.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear chronological structure following Bradley's life, but the frequent use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" disrupts the flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are less clear due to the placeholder phrases and complex sentence structures.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother, particularly between the different chapters.
- [LOGIC] The narrative is generally logical in its progression through Bradley's life, but some sections jump abruptly from one topic to another.
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent use of tenses and shifts between first-person and second-person narration in some sections.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
