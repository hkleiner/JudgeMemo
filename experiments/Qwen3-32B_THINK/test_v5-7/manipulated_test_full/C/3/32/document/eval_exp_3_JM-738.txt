Let me analyze this text based on the evaluation criteria provided. I'll start by looking at fluency issues and then move on to coherence issues.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are several instances of missing or incorrect articles (e.g., "In April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings; of that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad health—found himself...")
- [GRAMMAR] The text frequently uses em dashes without consistent formatting or punctuation.
- [GRAMMAR] There are many run-on sentences that could be better structured (e.g., "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _the thing_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”")
- [PUNCTUATION] The use of italics and underlining is inconsistent and sometimes confusing.
- [PUNCTUATION] The text frequently uses em dashes and semicolons without clear purpose or in ways that disrupt the flow.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are several instances where quotation marks are used inconsistently (e.g., "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.")
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling errors, though they are relatively minor (e.g., "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.")
- [STYLE] The text has a very formal and archaic style that is consistent throughout, but this is more of a stylistic choice than a fluency issue.

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is structured as a long essay with multiple sections, but the overall organization is not always clear.
- [LOGIC] The text makes many assertions about Dickens's intentions and the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" that are speculative and not always well-supported.
- [CLARITY] The text is dense and complex, with many references to characters and plot points that might be confusing to a reader unfamiliar with Dickens's work.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are often abrupt, with little to no connecting text.
- [ORGANIZATION] The text moves between analysis of the novel, discussion of various theories, and commentary on Dickens's writing style in a way that is sometimes disjointed.
- [CONSISTENCY] The text sometimes contradicts itself in its interpretations of the novel.
- [FOCUS] The text occasionally veers off into tangential discussions that don't directly support the main argument.

Based on this analysis:

For fluency, I would rate it a 3.5. While the text is generally readable and the author is clearly a skilled writer, there are enough grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and stylistic inconsistencies that make reading it a bit of a struggle at times. The archaic style might also make it less accessible to some readers.

For coherence, I would rate it a 3. The text has a clear overall purpose (analyzing Dickens's novel and various theories about its plot), but the organization is not always clear, and the transitions between sections are often abrupt. The text makes many speculative claims that are not always well-supported, and the density of information can make it difficult to follow the author's argument at times.

Let me double-check these evaluations to make sure I'm consistent with the scale provided:

FLUENCY SCALE:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented.

COHERENCE SCALE:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent.

My initial assessment seems to align with these definitions, so I'll go with:
- FINAL Coherence Score: 3
- FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and inconsistent use of punctuation throughout the text
- [GRAMMAR] Run-on sentences that could be better structured for clarity
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of italics, underlining, and quotation marks
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes and semicolons without clear purpose
- [STYLE] Archaic and formal language that, while consistent, may be less accessible to modern readers
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors in words like "Billickin" and "gamin"

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The long essay format lacks clear section divisions and transitions
- [LOGIC] Many speculative assertions about Dickens's intentions and the plot are presented without sufficient evidence
- [CLARITY] The text is dense with references to characters and plot points that may confuse readers unfamiliar with the novel
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between sections make the flow of ideas difficult to follow
- [ORGANIZATION] The text moves between analysis of the novel, theory discussion, and writing style commentary in a disjointed way
- [CONSISTENCY] Some interpretations contradict earlier statements in the text
- [FOCUS] Tangential discussions occasionally distract from the main argument

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
