I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me analyze the text carefully.

First, let me understand what fluency and coherence mean according to the instructions:

**Fluency** - Measures quality of individual sentences: grammatically correct, non-repetitive, in accord with common English usage, with clear meanings.

**Coherence** - Measures quality of all sentences collectively: make sense as a whole, with context organized and connected logically.

Now, let me examine the text for fluency issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "have a reasonable thing of it" (missing verb), "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing" (missing noun), "the stuff river crosses that country" (missing article), "it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them" (run-on sentence), "the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him" (subject-verb agreement issue).
- [SPELLING] - There are multiple misspellings: "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "jageed" instead of "jagged", "beatiful" instead of "beautiful", "euphonious" is misspelled as "euphony".
- [SYNTAX] - The syntax is often awkward or ungrammatical. For example: "By degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent" (awkward phrasing), "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" (awkward phrasing).
- [LEXICON] - There are repeated instances of "the stuff" and "a stuff" which appear to be placeholder words or omissions. This severely impacts readability.
- [REPETITION] - There is excessive repetition of phrases and concepts, which makes the text feel redundant and unfocused.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] - The logical flow is often disjointed. The text jumps between different topics and ideas without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] - The structure is very loose and lacks a clear organization. The text appears to be a collection of loosely connected observations and descriptions.
- [CLARITY] - Many concepts are not clearly explained or elaborated upon. The text often makes claims without providing supporting evidence or logical connections.
- [TRANSITION] - There are very few effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas. The reader is often left to infer connections between different sections.
- [FOCUS] - The text lacks a clear focus and tends to meander from one topic to another without a clear thread connecting them.
- [PLACEHOLDERS] - The frequent use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" as placeholder words or omissions severely impacts the coherence of the text, as they make it impossible to understand what the author is referring to in many cases.

Now let me assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For fluency:
The text has numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, awkward syntax, and confusing placeholder words. These issues significantly impact readability and comprehension. While there are some clear and well-constructed sentences, the overall fluency is poor.

I would rate the fluency as a 2.5 (between 2 and 3) on the scale.

For coherence:
The text lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The ideas are often disconnected, and the frequent use of placeholder words makes it difficult to follow the author's reasoning. While there are some descriptive passages that are coherent on their own, the overall coherence of the text is poor.

I would rate the coherence as a 2.0 on the scale.

Let me now structure my final evaluation:

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors including missing verbs, incorrect subject-verb agreement, and run-on sentences.  
- [SPELLING] Multiple misspellings such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", and "jageed" instead of "jagged".  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or ungrammatical syntax throughout the text.  
- [LEXICON] Repeated instances of "the stuff" and "a stuff" which appear to be placeholder words or omissions.  
- [REPETITION] Excessive repetition of phrases and concepts.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed logical flow with jumps between topics and ideas without clear connections.  
- [STRUCTURE] Very loose structure lacking clear organization.  
- [CLARITY] Many concepts are not clearly explained or elaborated upon.  
- [TRANSITION] Very few effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas.  
- [FOCUS] Lacks a clear focus and tends to meander from one topic to another.  
- [PLACEHOLDERS] Frequent use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" as placeholder words severely impacts coherence.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
