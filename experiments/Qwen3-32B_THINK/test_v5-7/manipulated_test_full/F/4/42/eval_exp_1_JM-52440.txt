Let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I need to understand what the text is about:
This is a theological treatise examining the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper, particularly in relation to the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The author is investigating whether the Church of England teaches a doctrine of the Real Presence (i.e., that Christ's body and blood are literally present in the bread and wine) or if it follows a more spiritual interpretation.

Now, let me examine the text for fluency issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1) [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text:

   - "the bread and wine cease to was bread and wine" should be "the bread and wine cease to be bread and wine"
   - "the body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner" should be "an heavenly" is archaic; modern usage would be "a heavenly"

   - "It is enough for my present purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other, but that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does not cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing signified."
   - "Now it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly clear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and having so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general definition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the Lord’s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and with her own explanation of the other sacrament." should be "were" instead of "were"

   - "Clever men and learned men may put forth such a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men must agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can was maintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the doctrine of the Church." should be "can be" instead of "can was"
