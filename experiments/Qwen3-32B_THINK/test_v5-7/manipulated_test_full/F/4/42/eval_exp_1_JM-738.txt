Let me carefully evaluate the text based on the provided criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll analyze the fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors in the text. For example, "coulded compensate" should be "could compensate", "have am made" should be "have made", and "have was" should be "have been".
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling errors like "Bleak House" with a lowercase "h", which should be capitalized as "Bleak House".
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or have incorrect word order. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises" could be clearer as "He constructed elaborate plots rich in secrets and surprises."
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are awkward or don't quite fit. For example, "Youth will be served;" is an odd construction that doesn't quite make sense in the context.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues, like missing commas and periods in some places, and excessive use of dashes in others.

Now for coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the text have logical inconsistencies or confusing reasoning. For example, the text frequently references theories about the mystery of Edwin Drood without clearly establishing the context or background for readers unfamiliar with the novel.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, complex analysis with many sections and subsections, but the structure is not always clear or well-organized. Some transitions between ideas are abrupt.
- [CLARITY] Some passages are dense and difficult to follow, especially when discussing literary theories and interpretations of the novel.
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between ideas, especially when moving from one theory to another or from analysis to narrative.
- [CONTEXT] The text assumes a certain level of familiarity with Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" that may not be appropriate for all readers.

Based on my evaluation:

FLUENCY:
The text has a number of grammatical errors, spelling issues, and awkward phrasing. While it is generally readable, these issues do interrupt the flow and clarity at times. The text is not fluent in the way it should be for high-quality writing.

COHERENCE:
The text is a complex analysis with many sections and subsections. While it's generally coherent in its overall argument, the dense nature of the content and the frequent shifts between different theories and interpretations make it challenging to follow at times. The structure could be clearer.

Final scores:
FLUENCY: 2.5 - The text has frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make it somewhat difficult to read. While the meaning is generally clear, the issues with fluency do distract from the overall reading experience.
COHERENCE: 3.0 - The text is generally coherent in its overall argument, but the complex nature of the content and the frequent shifts between different theories and interpretations make it challenging to follow at times. The structure could be clearer and more organized.
