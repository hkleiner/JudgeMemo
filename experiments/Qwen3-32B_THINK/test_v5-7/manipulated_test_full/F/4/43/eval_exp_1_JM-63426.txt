Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand its content and identify any issues.

First, the text appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, a designer and printer. It's written in a narrative style with multiple chapters covering different periods of his life and career. The language is quite formal and detailed, with a lot of historical and technical information about printing, typography, and design.

Now, I'll focus on fluency issues. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences being grammatically correct, non-repetitive, and in line with common English usage. I need to look for grammar errors, awkward phrasing, repetitive language, or any issues that might make the text hard to read.

Looking at the first few paragraphs of the introduction:
- "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This sentence is completely incoherent and doesn't follow any grammatical structure. It appears to be a jumbled mess of words with no clear meaning.
- "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed." The em dash usage is inconsistent, and the sentence structure is somewhat awkward.
- "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." The use of hyphens in "non-archaic, non-repetitive" is correct, but the sentence is quite long and could be more concise.

In the chapter about the boy printer of Ishpeming:
- "For your a visit East uncle back aunt “go and.”" This sentence is completely incoherent and doesn't follow standard English structure.
- "When you Iron printer the are leaves job Ore sorry. He has been a kind and patient teacher." This sentence lacks proper structure and is difficult to understand.
- "At shop print room big and saloon of barn the lodge date had a corner this above one been in is a a that early a of hall." This sentence is a jumbled mess with no clear meaning.

In the chapter about the first sojourn in Chicago:
- "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't form a proper sentence.
- "“Sometime, if you care to come back,” states Mr. Robinson, in a letter which must have been written immediately after your departure, “and if you will remain half an hour later in the evening and sweep out, and come in a half hour earlier in the morning and dust, Rand McNally will pay you three dollars a week.”" This is a long sentence with multiple clauses, but it's grammatically correct and clear.

In the chapter about the second sojourn in Chicago:
- "You the even your of skill the feeding and cutting do; but the is at at flimsy marvel which boys-wonder slippery jogging sheets with hand greater these and." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't follow any grammatical structure.

In the chapter about the Gay Nineties:
- "Recognized now as a period of over-ornamentation and bad taste, the Nineties were nevertheless years of leisurely contacts, kindly advice and an appreciative pat on the back by an employer, and certainly a friendly bohemianism seldom known in the rush and drive of today." This sentence is long and could be more concise, but it's grammatically correct and clear.

In the chapter about Springfield: The Wayside Press:
- "Such gorgeous title-pages! I gloated over dozens of them, making pencil memoranda of type arrangements and pencil sketches of wood-cut head and tail pieces and initials. Using afraid italic large the compositors caps spontaneity occasionally and a with cut with, with lower word a case of size pages a a a, merry have in Caslon roman and embellished-of depicting that basket line Black or enlivened wood, bunch types masterly of to a given of examples, refreshing these us sometimes sparkles in-or of with typography crude and title and use decoration literally never intermingling flowers Caslon joyousness." This passage is very jumbled and lacks clear structure. The sentences are long and run together without proper punctuation.

In the chapter about the magazine world:
- "In the mid-Eighties all monthlies, weeklies, books and booklets were hand-fed, folded, collated and bound; halftones were in an experimental stage; advertising agencies, if any existed, were not noticeable in Chicago, and advertising of a national character used only quarter-page cover space. But something in the air already quickened imagination, and the Nineties gave us more magazines and better display." This paragraph is long but grammatically correct and clear.

In the chapter about Hearst:
- "In 1915 Mr. Hearst asked me if I could arrange to give him all of my time and art-supervise production of the motion picture serial, Patria, starring Irene Castle. I agreed." This sentence is clear and grammatically correct.

In the chapter about today in 1954:
- "All such steadily growing advances present opportunities which were nonexistent back in my own youthful days. Together of any they changed by in have superior far wonderful, youth opportunities fraught I training with enjoyed today knew with a into new the the beyond Nineties the world conditions." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't follow any grammatical structure.

Based on my evaluation, there are significant fluency issues throughout the text. There are many incoherent sentences that don't follow standard English grammar or structure. Some of the sentences are long and complex, but they are still grammatically correct. However, the jumbled and incoherent sentences severely impact the overall fluency of the text.

Now, I'll evaluate coherence. Coherence refers to how well the sentences and ideas in the text connect logically to form a unified whole. I need to look for abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that make the text difficult to follow.

The text is organized into chapters that cover different periods of Will Bradley's life and career. Each chapter is generally focused on a specific time period or theme. However, there are several issues with coherence:

- The text has many incoherent passages that make it difficult to follow the narrative. When a sentence is completely jumbled or incoherent, it breaks the flow of the text.
- Some transitions between paragraphs or sections are abrupt or unclear. For example, the transition from the chapter about the boy printer of Ishpeming to the first sojourn in Chicago is not smooth.
- The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions. For instance, the chapter about the Wayside Press moves from discussing typography to discussing Mr. Moses and the Strathmore mill.
- Some of the content is repetitive or redundant, which can confuse the reader.

Despite these issues, the text does have a clear overall structure, with each chapter focusing on a specific period or theme in Will Bradley's life. The narrative generally flows from one chapter to the next, following a chronological order.

Overall, while there are some coherence issues due to incoherent passages and abrupt transitions, the text has a clear structure and generally follows a logical progression.

Now, I'll summarize my findings and assign scores based on the evaluation criteria.
