Let me evaluate this text according to the given criteria. First, I'll analyze fluency issues, then coherence issues, and finally provide the scores.

## Fluency Issues

Looking at the text, I notice several fluency problems:

1) [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors. For example:
   - "It is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed 'The Doctrine of the Real Presence,' is taught by the Church of England" has an incorrect placement of the comma after "Real Presence."
   - "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" has a missing article before "documents."
   - "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof" has awkward phrasing.

2) [SPELLING] There are some spelling issues:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" has an em dash used inconsistently.
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church" has inconsistent punctuation.

3) [SYNTAX] The text has complex, sometimes confusing sentence structures:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church" is confusing with the use of em dashes and semicolons.
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church" is repetitive and awkwardly constructed.

4) [LEXICON] Some word choice is awkward or unclear:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" uses "bearing" in an awkward way.
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church" is awkwardly phrased.

5) [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent punctuation:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church" has inconsistent use of em dashes and semicolons.
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" has an em dash used inconsistently.

6) [REPETITION] There is excessive repetition of phrases and ideas:
   - The text frequently repeats the phrase "the Church of England" and the concept of "Real Presence."

7) [STYLE] The text has a very formal and archaic style that may be difficult for modern readers to follow:
   - The text uses phrases like "IT is a very easy thing" and "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" that have an archaic feel.
   - The text uses complex sentence structures that may be difficult for some readers to follow.

8) [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or ambiguous:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church" is ambiguous in its meaning.
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" is unclear in its reference.

## Coherence Issues

Looking at the overall structure and flow of the text:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure:
   - The text jumps between different aspects of the Church of England's doctrine without clear transitions.
   - The text has long, complex paragraphs that make it difficult to follow the argument.

2) [LOGIC] The logical flow of the text is sometimes unclear:
   - The text makes complex theological arguments that are not always clearly connected.
   - The text sometimes presents arguments and then contradicts itself or introduces new concepts without sufficient explanation.

3) [ORGANIZATION] The text is not well-organized for the reader:
   - The text jumps between different aspects of the Church of England's doctrine without clear organization.
   - The text has long, complex paragraphs that make it difficult to follow the argument.

4) [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas are often abrupt or unclear:
   - The text frequently moves from one theological point to another without clear transitions.
   - The text sometimes introduces new concepts without sufficient context or explanation.

5) [FOCUS] The text sometimes loses focus on its main argument:
   - The text frequently digresses into detailed theological discussions that don't always clearly relate to the main argument.
   - The text sometimes goes into great detail about specific theological points without clearly connecting them to the overall argument.

6) [PERSPECTIVE] The text presents a very one-sided perspective:
   - The text presents a strong argument against the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England, but doesn't acknowledge or address counterarguments.
   - The text presents a very biased view of those who hold the doctrine of the Real Presence.

## Fluency Score

The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, complex sentence structures, and inconsistent punctuation. The style is very formal and archaic, which may be difficult for modern readers to follow. There is also excessive repetition of phrases and ideas.

However, the text is generally readable and the meaning is usually clear despite these issues. The text contains enough clear content to be understood, but the numerous errors and awkward phrasing make reading it somewhat difficult.

Based on the evaluation criteria, I would rate the fluency of this text as a 2.5. The text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentence structures that make comprehension difficult without effort.

## Coherence Score

The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with long, complex paragraphs that make it difficult to follow the argument. The logical flow is sometimes unclear, and the transitions between ideas are often abrupt or unclear. The text frequently loses focus on its main argument and presents a very one-sided perspective without acknowledging counterarguments.

Despite these issues, the text does present a clear argument and the overall purpose is generally understandable. The text is not completely incoherent, but the structure and organization make it difficult to follow at times.

Based on the evaluation criteria, I would rate the coherence of this text as a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing that make the overall coherence difficult to follow without extra effort.

Now I'll summarize my findings in the requested format.
