Okay, let me start by reading through the user's instructions carefully. The task is to evaluate a given text based on fluency and coherence, identifying issues and assigning scores. The user wants bullet points for each category with appropriate labels, followed by the final scores. 

First, I need to understand the definitions provided. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentences—grammatical correctness, non-repetitive phrasing, and common English usage. Coherence is about the overall structure and logical progression of the text. 

Looking at the text, it's a long, detailed description of someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River area. The author uses a lot of religious references and geographical details. 

For fluency issues, I'll scan for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The text has many typos and misspellings, like "thr earth" instead of "the earth," "tje antldiluvians" instead of "the antediluvians," and "ghev" instead of "give." There are also run-on sentences and awkward phrasings. For example, "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." has an odd structure. 

Coherence-wise, the text is very meandering. The author jumps from one geographical feature to another without clear transitions. The argument for the Garden of Eden being in this location is presented with a lot of detail but lacks a logical flow. The text also has a strong persuasive tone, which might affect coherence if it's not well-structured. 

I need to list each issue with the appropriate label. For example, [SPELLING] for misspelled words, [GRAMMAR] for grammatical errors, [LOGIC] for logical flow issues in coherence. 

Now, assigning the scores. For fluency, the text has numerous errors that would distract a reader. It's not entirely unreadable but definitely has many issues. Maybe a 2.5? But looking at the scale, a 2 is "frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing..." which fits. However, since the user allows half-points, perhaps 2.5. But I need to check the scale again. The scale says score 2: "Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort." The text has frequent errors, so maybe 2. 

For coherence, the text is all over the place, with abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. The argument isn't well-structured, making it hard to follow. The scale for coherence 2 is "frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas..." which fits. So coherence score 2. 

Wait, but the user allows half-points. Maybe 2.5 for coherence if there are some coherent parts. However, the text is quite incoherent overall. Let me recheck. The author starts with the discovery, then goes into geographical details, then into comparisons with other theories, then back to descriptions. There's no clear structure. The coherence is low. So maybe 2 for coherence. 

But I need to make sure each issue is properly categorized. Let me list all the fluency issues first, then coherence. Then assign the scores based on the scale.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Frequent misspellings (e.g., "thr earth," "tje antldiluvians," "ghev," "dimentions," "Howevwr," "ghree riverz," "bellowing," "sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is thebgarden of Eden").  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "he simply stated the principal facts, and gaveca description," "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the llace").  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and awkward phrasing (e.g., "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism").  
- [LEXICON] Non-idiomatic expressions (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing," "the innocent cause of no little speculation").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas in lists, inconsistent use of quotation marks, incomplete sentences).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Weak causal links between ideas (e.g., abrupt shifts from geographical claims to religious interpretations without connecting reasoning).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization (e.g., jumping between descriptions of locations, comparisons to other theories, and theological arguments without clear transitions).  
- [CLARITY] Overly verbose and repetitive explanations (e.g., multiple paragraphs on the same geographical feature with no progression).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., sudden shifts from describing "Trempealeau" to discussing "Engel’s book" without context).  
- [CONSISTENCY] Contradictory claims (e.g., asserting the garden is both "a half-acre garden patch" and a vast 35-mile valley without reconciliation).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.0
