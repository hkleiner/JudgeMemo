Let me carefully analyze the text according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I need to identify fluency issues in the text. Fluency relates to the quality of individual sentences, including grammatical correctness, non-repetition, and natural English usage.

Fluency Issues:
1) [GRAMMAR] The text has some grammatical issues, such as missing commas and inconsistent capitalization. For example, "IT is a very easy thing..." should be "It is a very easy thing..."
2) [GRAMMAR] There are some awkward constructions, like "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time" which could be more natural as "the Church of England is entering such a sifting time"
3) [REPETITION] There is some repetition of phrases, such as "the Church of England" which is used repeatedly throughout the text
4) [STYLE] The text uses a very formal, archaic style that may be difficult for modern readers to follow easily
5) [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have issues with subject-verb agreement or proper use of prepositions

Now for coherence issues. Coherence relates to how well the text functions as a whole, with logical connections between ideas and a clear structure.

Coherence Issues:
1) [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and dense, making it challenging to follow the overall argument
2) [LOGIC] While the text is well-structured in terms of its main argument, the complex theological concepts and the formal style make the logical flow sometimes difficult to follow
3) [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother to help guide the reader through the complex theological discussion
4) [CLARITY] Some of the theological concepts are explained in a way that may be unclear to readers without a strong background in Christian theology
5) [FOCUS] While the text maintains a consistent focus on the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England, the dense writing style and complex subject matter can make it difficult to maintain focus

Now let me score the text on both metrics:

For fluency:
The text is generally well-written with few grammatical errors. The writing is formal but grammatically sound. The repetition is not excessive, and while the style is archaic, it's consistent throughout. I would rate the fluency as a 4.5 - mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

For coherence:
The text presents a clear argument with a logical structure. It has a clear introduction, main body, and conclusion. The organization of the argument is generally good. However, the dense writing style, complex subject matter, and formal archaic language make it somewhat challenging to follow at times. I would rate the coherence as a 4.5 - mostly coherent with a few areas where the flow or clarity could be improved.

Let me double check these assessments:

Fluency: 4.5 - The text is mostly fluent with only minor grammatical issues and awkward constructions. The writing is formal but grammatically correct. The repetition is not excessive. The archaic style is consistent but might be challenging for some readers.

Coherence: 4.5 - The text has a clear structure with a logical flow of ideas. The argument is well-organized, though the complex subject matter and formal style make it somewhat challenging to follow at times. The transitions between ideas could be smoother in places.

I'm satisfied with these assessments.

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Missing commas and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "IT is" should be "It is") - [STYLE] Overly formal/archaic language ("I am not now making any assertion") - [REPETITION] Excessive repetition of "the Church of England" - [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in some complex sentences - [PUNCTUATION] Some run-on sentences that could benefit from better punctuation

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Very dense and lengthy without sufficient paragraph breaks - [LOGIC] Complex theological arguments require careful attention to follow - [TRANSITION] Some abrupt shifts between ideas - [CLARITY] Theological concepts presented in a highly formal style that may be difficult for general readers - [FOCUS] While focused on the main topic, the dense writing style makes it challenging to maintain engagement

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
