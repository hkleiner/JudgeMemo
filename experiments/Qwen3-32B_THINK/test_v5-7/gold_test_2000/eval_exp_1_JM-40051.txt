Alright, let me start by reading the text carefully to understand what it's about. The author is claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the United States, specifically near the Mississippi River. They use biblical references and geographical comparisons to support their argument. Now, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence.

First, fluency. Fluency refers to how smoothly and grammatically correct the text is. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or spelling mistakes. Let me go through the text again.

I notice some typos like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admir ing" (probably "admiring"). There's also a missing space in "Euphratesâ€”river," which should be "Euphrates river." The phrase "Our garden is again right. But it should be a place..." has a run-on sentence. The word "scientest" is misspelled; it should be "scientist." The sentence "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large" has awkward phrasing. Also, "the Euphrates river crosses that country, that 'eastward', or on the eastward, bank..." has repetition and unclear structure. The phrase "Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names." has a misplaced comma. "Bridtish" is misspelled as "British." The sentence "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;" is confusing and lacks a closing quotation mark. The phrase "uninhabitable or unfit for a garden, but the very beau ideal of a garden." is a bit contradictory. The sentence "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;" is awkward. Also, "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;" seems like a metaphor that's not clearly explained. The phrase "O, how beautifully..." uses an unnecessary comma. "jageed" is misspelled as "jagged." There's also a missing period at the end of the last sentence before the evaluation form.

Now, moving to coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow and connect. The text is a mix of arguments, descriptions, and personal anecdotes. The author starts by explaining their reluctance to publish, then moves into biblical references, geographical comparisons, and descriptions of the landscape. The transition from the initial hesitation to the detailed geographical analysis is abrupt. The connection between the biblical Garden of Eden and the Mississippi River valley is made through several analogies (e.g., rivers, the hanging garden), but the logic is a bit forced. The author mentions the presence of rattlesnakes as a nod to the serpent in Eden, which is a creative but tenuous link. The structure is somewhat disjointed, jumping between different points without clear transitions. The conclusion is a bit rushed, summarizing the findings without a strong concluding statement. The overall argument is presented in a series of assertions without much supporting evidence, which might make it hard for some readers to follow.

For fluency issues, I'll list each error with a label. For coherence, I'll note where the flow is disrupted or the logic is weak. Then assign scores based on the criteria provided. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other issues. The author uses phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing..." which is a bit vague. Also, "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;" is unclear. The text has some repetition, like "Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right." This repetition might be intentional for emphasis but could be seen as a flaw in fluency.

Considering all these points, I'll rate the fluency and coherence accordingly. The fluency issues are numerous but not too severe to make the text unreadable, so maybe a 3. Coherence is also a 3 because the arguments are present but lack strong logical connections and transitions.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (misspelled)  
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" (misspelled "admiring")  
- [SPELLING] "dimentions" (misspelled "dimensions")  
- [SPELLING] "scientest" (misspelled "scientist")  
- [SPELLING] "Bridtish" (misspelled "British")  
- [SPELLING] "jageed" (misspelled "jagged")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Euphrates river crosses that country, that 'eastward', or on the eastward, bank..." (repetition and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;" (unclear metaphor, missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large" (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing period at the end of the final sentence before the evaluation form  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Forced comparisons between biblical Eden and the Mississippi Valley (e.g., linking rattlesnakes to the serpent)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between personal anecdotes and geographical arguments  
- [LOGIC] Weak causal links between evidence (e.g., river names, topography) and the central claim  
- [CLARITY] Unclear metaphors (e.g., "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality'")  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive assertions (e.g., "Our garden is still in the right place... Our garden is again right") without progression  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory phrasing: "uninhabitable or unfit for a garden, but the very beau ideal of a garden"  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
