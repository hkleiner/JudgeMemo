Alright, let me analyze the given text to evaluate its fluency and coherence according to the provided criteria.

First, I'll examine fluency, which refers to the quality of individual sentences being grammatically correct, non-repetitive, and in accord with common English usage with clear meanings.

Fluency Issues:
1) [GRAMMAR] - "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career..." has a comma splice issue.
2) [GRAMMAR] - "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." These two sentences could be combined for better flow.
3) [GRAMMAR] - "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." The question mark here is misplaced and confusing.
4) [SPELLING] - "pi" should be "type" or "type pi" (this appears to be a typo).
5) [GRAMMAR] - "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." is awkwardly phrased and could be restructured for clarity.
6) [GRAMMAR] - "The two jobbers are kicked." This is an unusual phrasing that might be confusing without context.
7) [GRAMMAR] - "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The dash usage here is awkward and could be replaced with a colon.
8) [GRAMMAR] - "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid." The placement of the parenthetical phrase is awkward.
9) [GRAMMAR] - "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." This sentence is somewhat awkward in construction.
10) [GRAMMAR] - "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?" The dash usage here is awkward and the rhetorical question could be clearer.

Now, for coherence, which refers to how well the sentences and ideas connect to form a unified and well-organized whole.

Coherence Issues:
1) [STRUCTURE] - The text jumps between different time periods and topics with minimal transition, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
2) [LOGIC] - The transition from discussing Bradley's influence on American graphic arts to his personal history as a child printer is abrupt.
3) [LOGIC] - The narrative switches between a biographical account of Bradley and commentary on his artistic significance without clear demarcation.
4) [TRANSITION] - There are few transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the different sections and time periods.
5) [CLARITY] - Some passages are overly descriptive and could benefit from more concise explanations of their relevance to the main narrative.
6) [LOGIC] - The final paragraph about the editor and the faker is somewhat disconnected from the main narrative about Bradley's life and career.
7) [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks clear chapter divisions or other structural elements to help organize the content.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

For fluency, the text is generally well-written with clear, natural phrasing. There are some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but these are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt reading or understanding. I would give it a 4.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence, the text has some issues with structure and logical flow, particularly with the abrupt transitions between different topics and time periods. The narrative would benefit from clearer organization and transitional elements. However, the content is still largely understandable and the main narrative is discernible. I would give it a 3.5 on the coherence scale.
