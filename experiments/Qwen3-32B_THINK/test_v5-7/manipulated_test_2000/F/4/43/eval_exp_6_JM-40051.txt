Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The text has a lot of run-on sentences and missing commas, which makes reading a bit jarring. For example, in the first paragraph, "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The comma after "go ahead" is there, but the sentence still feels a bit clunky. There are also some spelling errors like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians." 

Looking further, there are instances of incorrect verb tenses. For example, "have ventured to publish it" should probably be "have ventured to publish it," but that's correct. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The sentence is "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The subject "I" is missing after the comma, which is a grammatical error. That's a [GRAMMAR] issue.

There are also some awkward phrasings. The sentence "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." This is a run-on sentence with multiple clauses connected by commas. It should be broken into shorter sentences for clarity. That's a [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example is "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth," which is a bit awkward. Maybe "destitute of monetary mineral wealth" would be better. Also, "Our garden is again right." That's a bit unclear. Perhaps "Our garden is again in the right place." That's a [LEXICON] issue.

Now moving to coherence. The text is trying to argue that a specific location in America is the Garden of Eden, using biblical references and geographical features. However, the flow of ideas is a bit disjointed. The author jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the location, there's a sudden shift to talking about the Mississippi River and its banks, which might confuse the reader if they don't connect it back to the main argument. That's a [LOGIC] issue.

There's also a lack of clear structure. The text doesn't follow a logical progression, making it hard to follow the author's reasoning. The mention of "Trempealeau" and the rattlesnakes seems out of place without proper context. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue.

Additionally, some parts of the text are repetitive. The author repeatedly mentions "Our garden is in the right place" without building on that idea. That's a [CLARITY] issue.

There are also some confusing phrases, like "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to..." This part is incoherent and doesn't make sense, which is a [CLARITY] issue as well.

Putting this all together, the fluency issues include grammar errors, syntax problems, and awkward phrasing. The coherence issues involve logical flow, structure, and clarity. Now, I need to assign scores. For fluency, the text has multiple errors that interrupt the flow but the main ideas are still understandable. So maybe a 3. For coherence, the structure and transitions are weak, making the argument hard to follow, so maybe a 2.5.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing subject after comma: "have ventured to publish it"  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect word: "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians"  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence: Long, unbroken sentence with multiple clauses  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing: "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth"  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled word: "admirirg" should be "admir ing"  
- [SYNTAX] Fragmented sentence: "Nineteen been at lost a..." is incoherent  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas: Sudden shifts between biblical arguments and geographical descriptions  
- [STRUCTURE] Poor organization: Lack of clear progression in argumentation  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive statements: Repeated "Our garden is in the right place" without development  
- [CLARITY] Confusing phrasing: "Nineteen been at lost a..." disrupts coherence  
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitions: Abrupt jumps between topics (e.g., rattlesnakes to city descriptions)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
