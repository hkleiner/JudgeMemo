Alright, let me evaluate this text for fluency and coherence.

Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences: are they grammatically correct, non-repetitive, and in accord with common English usage with clear meanings?

Looking at the text, I notice:
- There are some grammatical issues. For example, "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This sentence is incoherent and seems to have a grammatical error.
- There are instances of awkward phrasing, like "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift. It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into."
- Some sentences have missing words or are run-on, making them difficult to parse.

Coherence refers to the quality of all sentences collectively: do they make sense as a whole, with the context organized and connected logically?

Looking at the text:
- The text appears to be a religious treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England.
- There is a logical progression in discussing the introduction, then moving to the Real Presence, and then to the Articles.
- However, there are some abrupt shifts in the text, especially in the section discussing the Articles.
- The text is dense and complex, with theological terminology, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow.

Based on these observations:

For Fluency:
- The text has some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing that make it less fluent.
- However, the majority of the text is understandable and follows proper English usage.
- I would rate the fluency as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but has noticeable issues that interrupt the flow.

For Coherence:
- The text has a clear structure and logical progression, with an introduction, then discussion of the Real Presence, and then analysis of the Articles.
- There are some abrupt shifts and dense sections that may challenge readers, but the overall coherence is maintained.
- I would rate the coherence as a 4 - it's mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.

Let me double-check my assessment:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into." This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [SYNTAX] "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that." This is a run-on sentence with poor syntax.

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from the introduction to the Real Presence, then to the Articles, but there are some abrupt shifts in the section discussing the Articles.
- [LOGIC] The dense theological terminology and complex concepts may make it challenging for some readers to follow the logical progression.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
