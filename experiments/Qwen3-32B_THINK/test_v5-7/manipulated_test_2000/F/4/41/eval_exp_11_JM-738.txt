There are many spelling errors throughout the text. These errors are not minor and significantly affect the readability and professionalism of the text.

There are also some grammatical issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said," - This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like it's missing a subject or is in the wrong structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "He therefpre abandoned a new series of Readings." - The word "therefpre" is misspelled (should be "therefore"), but even with the correct spelling, the sentence structure is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "He may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour." - This sentence is a bit convoluted and could be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”" - The quotation mark placement is awkward and the sentence is a bit confusing.

Given the numerous spelling errors and some grammatical issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2. The text is often difficult to read due to these errors, though some segments are clear.

**Coherence Issues:**

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is a scholarly analysis of a novel, but it jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Dickens's health to analyzing characters and then to other critics' views without clear connections.

2) [LOGIC] Some arguments appear to be presented without sufficient context or explanation. The reader is often expected to understand references to other works, critics, and literary terms without background information.

3) [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow. For example: "We may be sure that he was to see “_that_” in real life. We must remember that, according to Forster, “such was Dickens’s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism.”" This sentence is confusing and lacks clarity.

4) [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections. The abrupt changes in topic make it difficult to follow the author's argument.

5) [LOGIC] The author presents their own theory without clearly explaining the evidence or reasoning that supports it. The reader is expected to accept the author's conclusions without sufficient explanation.

6) [CLARITY] The text contains many references to other works and critics without providing sufficient context or explanation for a general reader. For example, the mention of "Mr. Cuming Walters" and his work without explaining who he is or what his theory is.

7) [LOGIC] Some arguments appear to be based on assumptions rather than evidence. For example, the author states that they "dissent" from Mr. Walters's theory without clearly explaining why.

8) [CLARITY] The text is written in a very formal and academic style that may be difficult for some readers to understand. The author uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures without always providing clear explanations.

Given these issues with structure, logic, clarity, and transitions, I would rate the coherence as a 3. The text is generally coherent and follows a logical progression, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

So, my final assessment is:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "absolutsly" - [SPELLING] "deserfed" - [SPELLING] "ajd" - [SPELLING] "romam" - [SPELLING] "apopldxy" - [SPELLING] "seuzures" - [SPELLING] "ingsnious" - [SPELLING] "conceaoed" - [SPELLING] "there arectwo" - [SPELLING] "thebsupernormal" - [SPELLING] "a-ysar" - [SPELLING] "thickmblack" - [SPELLING] "ovwr" - [SPELLING] "nickjamed" - [SPELLING] "beyfre" - [SPELLING] "fhat" - [SPELLING] "tjis" - [SPELLING] "Fathedral" - [SPELLING] "pronouhces" - [SPELLING] "muzt" - [SPELLING] "unintelligiboe" - [SPELLING] "svholar" - [SPELLING] "giod" - [SPELLING] "vexpecting" - [SPELLING] "Durdpes" - [GRAMMAR] "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said," - [GRAMMAR] "He therefpre abandoned a new series of Readings." - [GRAMMAR] "He may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour." - [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2

Wait, let me review this again. The fluency score of 2 seems quite low. Let me reconsider:

The text is a scholarly analysis and is written in a formal style. While there are many spelling errors (25+), the content is generally understandable once the reader gets past the spelling issues. The sentences, while sometimes complex, are generally grammatically correct when ignoring the spelling errors. Given that the content is still
