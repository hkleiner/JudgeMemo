Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll identify fluency issues (problems with individual sentences):

1) Spelling errors: I see several spelling mistakes like "best-establisjed", "unvommon", "confidenve", "as ifmthey", "doctrime", "groundworknof", "tue", "RealnPresence", "investigatemin", "glessed", "chnater", "tbe", "tbe", "Daviour", "witbout", "sectwo", "mass pf", "writeds", "tp", "invisibly", "incorpoeated", "xescribes", "badye", "hexven", "tye", "dign", "perfectky", "generak", "chamge", "momentnassert".

2) Grammar issues: I see some grammatical problems like missing words, incorrect word forms, and other issues that affect sentence structure.

3) Syntax issues: Some sentences have awkward or non-standard syntax that makes them harder to understand.

4) Lexicon issues: Some word choices seem odd or not quite right for the context.

Now, for coherence issues (problems with the overall organization and logical flow):

1) I'll check if the text has a clear and logical progression throughout.

2) I'll look for abrupt shifts or unclear transitions between ideas.

3) I'll check if the text is organized in a way that makes sense and supports its overall purpose.

4) I'll look for any confusing or contradictory statements.

Let me now evaluate these in more detail:

Fluency Issues:
- [SPELLING] "best-establisjed" should be "best-established"
- [SPELLING] "unvommon" should be "uncommon"
- [SPELLING] "confidenve" should be "confidence"
- [SPELLING] "as ifmthey" should be "as if they"
- [SPELLING] "doctrime" should be "doctrine"
- [SPELLING] "groundworknof" should be "groundwork of"
- [SPELLING] "tue" should be "the"
- [SPELLING] "RealnPresence" should be "Real Presence"
- [SPELLING] "investigatemin" should be "investigate in"
- [SPELLING] "glessed" should be "blessed"
- [SPELLING] "chnater" should be "chapter"
- [SPELLING] "tbe" should be "the" (multiple instances)
- [SPELLING] "Daviour" should be "Saviour"
- [SPELLING] "witbout" should be "without"
- [SPELLING] "sectwo" should be "the two"
- [SPELLING] "mass pf" should be "mass of"
- [SPELLING] "writeds" should be "writings"
- [SPELLING] "tp" should be "to"
- [SPELLING] "invisibly" should be "invisibly" (correct, but appears odd in context)
- [SPELLING] "incorpoeated" should be "incorporated"
- [SPELLING] "xescribes" should be "describes"
- [SPELLING] "badye" should be "badge"
- [SPELLING] "hexven" should be "heaven"
- [SPELLING] "tye" should be "the"
- [SPELLING] "dign" should be "sign"
- [SPELLING] "perfectky" should be "perfectly"
- [SPELLING] "generak" should be "general"
- [SPELLING] "chamge" should be "change"
- [SPELLING] "momentnassert" should be "moment to assert"

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and dense, which can make it challenging to follow the logical flow.
- [LOGIC] The text presents a complex theological argument that may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter to follow.
- [CLARITY] Some of the theological concepts discussed are quite abstract and may be unclear to readers without a strong background in Christian theology.
- [TRANSITION] While the text does attempt to move logically from one point to the next, some transitions could be clearer, especially when moving between different theological positions or concepts.
- [ORGANIZATION] The text is organized in a somewhat traditional theological writing style with a clear introduction and chapters, but the dense nature of the content can make it difficult to see the overall structure.

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For fluency, I notice that while there are a significant number of spelling errors, the text is generally readable and the meaning is clear despite these errors. The grammar is mostly correct where it's not affected by the spelling errors, and the syntax is generally clear. The text is written in a formal, theological style that is appropriate for the content. Given the number of spelling errors, but the overall readability, I would rate fluency as a 3.5.

For coherence, the text has a clear structure with an introduction and chapters. The argument is logical and follows a clear progression, though it's quite dense and may be challenging for some readers. The transitions between ideas are generally clear, though some could be smoother. The text presents a complex theological argument that is internally consistent. Given the clarity of the structure and the logical progression of the argument, I would rate coherence as a 4.0.
