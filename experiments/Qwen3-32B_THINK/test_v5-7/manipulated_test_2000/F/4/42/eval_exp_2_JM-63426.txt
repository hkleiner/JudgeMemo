Okay, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

First, fluency. I'm looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexicon issues. The text is quite long, so I'll need to check for any repeated errors. Let's see... There are some verb tense issues. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" – "shoulded" is incorrect. Then "It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The verb "stir" is intransitive here, but maybe that's a stylistic choice. Wait, "stir in its sleep" might be okay. 

Another example: "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?" The use of "whose" here is correct, but maybe the punctuation with the dash is a bit informal. "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he take off..." "Take off" should be "takes off" or "took off" for past tense. 

Then, "Bradley may had had some such idea..." "May had" is incorrect; it should be "may have had." Also, "It don’t worked" – "don’t" is present tense, but "worked" is past. Should be "didn’t work." 

In the second chapter, "Most of the work is do by hand." "Do" should be "done." "You carried finished work back..." "Carried" is past tense, but the narrative is in past tense, so maybe that's okay. "It is the kind you place on a table and slapped..." "Slapped" should be "slap" if it's present tense, but the context is past, so maybe "slapped" is correct. Wait, the sentence is "you place on a table and slapped..." Hmm, maybe "you place on a table and slap..." but the original uses past tense. Maybe it's a dangling modifier issue. 

"Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." "Pi" is a typo; should be "type" or "ink." 

"Your father is ill, an aftermath of the Civil War." The phrase "an aftermath of" is a bit awkward. Maybe "an aftereffect of" would be better. 

"Between meals, when you was hungry..." "Was" should be "were." 

"You was on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston." "Was" should be "were." 

"Your mother kept house for your cousins. Every night when you go to bed..." Mix of past and present tense. 

"Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch." This is okay. 

"You are having trouble with arithmetic--something in division. Teacher says, “Took your books and went home, Willie, and remained until you have the correct answer.”" "Took" should be "Take," and "have" should be "had." 

"Your mother was troubled. Finally she says..." Mix of past and present tense. 

"You go to the office of the Iron Agitator, that later become Iron Ore." "That" should be "which," and "become" should be "became." 

"The two jobbers are kicked." This is unclear. Maybe "The two jobbers are kicked out" or something else. 

"Mr. Newett walks leisurely to where there was several guns..." "Was" should be "are" if referring to present time. 

Looking at all these issues, there are a number of grammatical errors, tense inconsistencies, and some awkward phrasing. But the text is quite long, so the errors might be spread out. Let me count how many I found. There are maybe 15-20 issues. Since the text is lengthy, each error might be a minor one, but they add up. 

For fluency score: If there are multiple grammatical issues that interrupt the flow, it might be a 3. But if they're spread out and not too distracting, maybe a 4. Since I found several errors, but the overall readability is still okay, maybe a 3.5? But the instructions allow half-points. Hmm. Let me think. The text is generally readable, but the errors are frequent enough to be noticeable. So maybe a 3.5. 

Now for coherence. I need to check if the sentences connect logically and the structure is clear. The text is split into two chapters, each with a narrative. The first chapter is an introduction discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts. The second chapter is a story about his early life. 

In the first chapter, the flow is a bit abrupt. The author transitions from talking about Bradley's work to the broader context of 19th-century art movements, then back to Bradley's influence in America. The connection between these parts might be a bit loose. For example, the paragraph starting with "Across the Atlantic..." jumps into European artists, which is relevant but could use a smoother transition. 

In the second chapter, the narrative is a series of events in Bradley's early life. The structure is chronological, which is good, but there are some abrupt shifts in time and events. For example, the transition from his father's illness to moving to Swampscott, then to school, then to other events. The use of "you" in the second person is consistent, which helps with the narrative flow. 

However, there are some inconsistencies in the timeline. For example, "You was on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston" – the use of "was" instead of "were" might not affect coherence as much as fluency. 

The overall structure is organized into chapters and paragraphs, but some paragraphs are quite long and could benefit from better transitions. For example, the part about the Iron Ore job printer leaving and then moving to another job is a bit abrupt. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "The two jobbers are kicked." It's unclear what "kicked" refers to. This could confuse the reader. 

In terms of coherence, the text is mostly logical and organized, but there are some weak transitions and confusing parts. The use of the second-person narrative is consistent, which helps, but the frequent shifts in time and some unclear sentences might lower the coherence score. 

For coherence score: If the text is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts or unclear transitions, it might be a 3. But if the issues are not too severe, maybe a 3.5. Given the length and some of the issues, I think a 3.5 is appropriate.

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "It shoulded be talked about" (incorrect verb form). - [GRAMMAR] "It is hard to realized" (incorrect verb form). - [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may had had" (incorrect past perfect tense). - [GRAMMAR] "It don’t worked" (subject-verb disagreement). - [GRAMMAR] "Most of the work is do by hand" (incorrect verb form). - [GRAMMAR] "when you was hungry" (subject-verb disagreement). - [GRAMMAR] "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'" (subject-verb disagreement). - [GRAMMAR] "Teacher says, 'Took your books...'" (incorrect imperative form). - [GRAMMAR] "the newspaper that were later sued" (subject-verb disagreement). - [GRAMMAR] "The two jobbers are kicked" (ambiguous/unclear verb usage). - [SPELLING] "pi" instead of "type" or "ink". - [SPELLING] "was" instead of "were" in multiple instances. - [TENSE] Inconsistent past/present tense usage ("Your mother kept house... Every night when you go to bed..."). - [TENSE] "that later become" (incorrect tense). - [TENSE] "you would be seven" (correct but inconsistent with narrative tense). - [SYNTAX] "from that springboard he take off" (tense inconsistency). - [SYNTAX] "he and the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that wasn't over yet" (awkward phrasing). - [LEXICON] "You are the artist" (ambiguous pronoun reference). - [LEXICON] "the kiosks of Paris when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne..." (awkward phrasing). - [LEXICON] "they are scarcely aware of their debt to him--the pioneer and pacemaker" (awkward phrasing).  

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from European art movements to American context without clear transition. - [LOGIC] Sudden jump from discussing Bradley's impact to his personal life in the second chapter. - [STRUCTURE] Long, meandering paragraphs with unclear topic progression. - [CLARITY] Ambiguous references in second-person narrative ("You are the artist", "You carried finished work..."). - [TRANSITION] Sudden time shifts in second chapter without clear markers ("You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'... then 'In the fall you went to school...'"). - [LOGIC] Unclear connection between Bradley's printing work and his later artistic achievements. - [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline presentation (e.g., "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'... then 'In the fall you went to school...'"). - [CLARITY] Ambiguous sentence: "The two jobbers are kicked." - [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the Civil War aftermath and Bradley's father's illness.
