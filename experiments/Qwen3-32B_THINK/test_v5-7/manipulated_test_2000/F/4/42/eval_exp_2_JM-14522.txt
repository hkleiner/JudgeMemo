Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies and subject-verb agreement problems throughout the text. Examples:
   - "every one tell him he was doing a very foolish thing"
   - "when they come to discuss terms"
   - "she never really recover"
   - "the ghost has am see by several living members"
   - "we'dded have it at home"
   - "It may had resisted"
   - "the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended"
   - "which he never ceased to regretted"
   - "qualified himself for American diplomacy by led the German"
   - "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses"
   - "The twins am usually called"
   - "the Minister have telegraphed"
   - "a curious stillness seem to hold"
   - "before they reach the house"
   - "some big drops of rain have fallen"
   - "reply the old housekeeper"
   - "had been much admire by tourists"
   - "It must was removed"
   - "the blood-stain has been much admire"
   - "he have fallen upon his knees"
   - "I knew Pinkerton woulded did it"
   - "no sooner have he said"
   - "light up the sombre room"
   - "made them all started"
   - "she woedn't fainted"
   - "there was no doubt, however, that she is extremely upset"
   - "to bewared of some trouble came"
   - "I had seen things with my own eyes"
   - "that would make any Christian's hair stood on end"
   - "the library have been lock up"
   - "the whole family were now quite interested"
   - "he have been too dogmatic"
   - "all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata am removed"
   - "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts"
   - "as I have since learn from Mr. Otis"
   - "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which is not at all feverish"
   - "He put on his slippers, take a small oblong phial"
   - "My dear sir, I really must insist on your oiled those chains"
   - "have bring you for that purpose"
   - "It is said to was completely efficacious"
   - "and would be happy to supply you with more, should you require it"
   - "closing his door, retire to rest"
   - "For a moment the Canterville ghost stand quite motionless"
   - "he fled down the corridor, uttered hollow groans"
   - "a door is flung open"

2. [SPELLING] Some spelling issues:
   - "we'dded" should be "we'd"
   - "woedn't" should be "wouldn't"
   - "oiled" should be "oil"
   - "woulded" should be "would"
   - "flung" should be "flung" (this is actually correct, but the form is unusual)

3. [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures:
   - "I reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'dded have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show."
   - "I guess the old country was so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody."
   - "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which is not at all feverish."
   - "My dear sir, I really must insist on your oiled those chains, and have bring you for that purpose a small bottle..."
   - "It is said to was completely efficacious upon one application..."
   - "and would be happy to supply you with more, should you require it."

4. [LEXICON] Inappropriate word usage:
   - "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses" (should be "are")
   - "The twins am usually called" (should be "are")
   - "the Minister have telegraphed" (should be "had telegraphed")
   - "the library have been lock up" (should be "had been locked up")
   - "all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata am removed" (should be "are removed")
   - "the conversation in no way turned upon ghosts" (awkward phrasing)

5. [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation:
   - Missing commas in complex sentences
   - Missing quotation marks for dialogue
   - Missing periods at the end of sentences
   - Missing hyphens in compound adjectives

6. [STYLE] Inconsistent writing style with some modern expressions mixed with more formal ones in an unnatural way.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] Some logical inconsistencies:
   - The text jumps between different time points without clear transitions
   - Some events happen without clear cause-effect relationships
   - The narrative sometimes shifts between characters without explanation

2. [STRUCTURE] Structural issues:
   - The text has a chapter format but lacks clear paragraphing
   - The flow between sentences is sometimes abrupt
   - There are long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow
   - The text has an overall structure but it's not always clear how the different elements connect

3. [CLARITY] Clarity issues:
   - Some phrases are ambiguous or confusing
   - The meaning is not always clear due to grammatical errors
   - Some references are unclear without more context

4. [TRANSITION] Transition problems:
   - The text lacks smooth transitions between ideas
   - Some shifts in time or perspective are abrupt
   - The connections between sentences are sometimes unclear

5. [PLOT] Plot development issues:
   - The story has a plot but it's not always well-developed
   - Some character motivations are unclear
   - The narrative sometimes jumps between different characters without explanation

Now, let me score the text according to the given criteria:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous grammatical errors, tense inconsistencies, and subject-verb agreement problems throughout. These errors are frequent and often make comprehension difficult. The text contains many awkward phrasings and unnatural sentence structures. While there are some clear and understandable parts, the overall fluency is significantly impacted by these issues. According to the scale, this would be a Score 2.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a general structure and follows a narrative, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. The plot is somewhat coherent but lacks smooth progression and clear connections between ideas. There are logical inconsistencies in some places, and the narrative sometimes jumps between characters without explanation. According to the scale, this would be a Score 3.
