Let me evaluate the text based on the given criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll identify fluency issues (problems with individual sentences):
- [GRAMMAR] "he certainly write no longer" should be "he certainly wrote no longer"
- [GRAMMAR] "He speak to his sister-in-law" should be "He spoke to his sister-in-law"
- [GRAMMAR] "Yet, when he die in June, 1870, left three completed numbers still unpublished" should be "Yet, when he died in June, 1870, he left three completed numbers still unpublished"
- [GRAMMAR] "many efforts have been make" should be "many efforts have been made"
- [GRAMMAR] "Dickens was worked over the late Lord Lytton’s tale" should be "Dickens was working over the late Lord Lytton’s tale"

- [GRAMMAR] "He see in his vision" should be "He sees in his vision"
- [GRAMMAR] "He was to see “_that_” in real life" should be "He was to see “_that_” in real life" (though this is more of a style issue than a grammar issue)
- [GRAMMAR] "he might had fallen" should be "he might have fallen"
- [GRAMMAR] "there was two specimens" should be "there were two specimens"
- [GRAMMAR] "If I was right" should be "If I were right"
- [GRAMMAR] "make valuable suggestions, but is responsible" should be "made valuable suggestions, but is responsible"

- [GRAMMAR] "who have a friend" should be "who had a friend"
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Bud wedded a lady" should be "Mr. Bud wed a lady" or "Mr. Bud married a lady"
- [GRAMMAR] "Grewgious was apparently legal agent" should be "Grewgious was apparently a legal agent"
- [GRAMMAR] "which Grewgious was to handed over" should be "which Grewgious was to hand over"
- [GRAMMAR] "if, when he attain his majority" should be "if, when he attained his majority"
- [GRAMMAR] "John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents die)" should be "John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died)"
- [GRAMMAR] "has am a victim" should be "has been a victim"
- [GRAMMAR] "has am a victim to the habit of opium smoking" should be "has been a victim to the habit of opium smoking"
- [GRAMMAR] "has am a determined drunkard" should be "has been a determined drunkard"
- [GRAMMAR] "she had am very disreputable for twenty-six years" should be "she had been very disreputable for twenty-six years"
- [GRAMMAR] "He was being watched by the hag" should be "He was being watched by the hag" (this is actually correct, but the sentence is awkward)
- [GRAMMAR] "we are introduce to the Dean" should be "we are introduced to the Dean"
- [GRAMMAR] "He pronounced it “unintelligible,” which satisfied him that his own babble, when under opium, must was unintelligible also" should be "He pronounced it “unintelligible,” which satisfied him that his own babble, when under opium, must be unintelligible also"
- [GRAMMAR] "He was, presumably, acquaint with the languages" should be "He was, presumably, acquainted with the languages"
- [GRAMMAR] "how coulded he hoped to understand" should be "how could he have hoped to understand"
- [GRAMMAR] "The tale opened abruptly" should be "The tale opens abruptly"
- [GRAMMAR] "is to play a great but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain" should be "is to play a great but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain" (this is more of a style issue than a grammar issue)
- [GRAMMAR] "After this dinner, Jasper had a “weird seizure;” “a strange film comes over Jasper’s eyes”" should be "After this dinner, Jasper had a “weird seizure;” “a strange film came over Jasper’s eyes”"
- [GRAMMAR] "Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he loathes his life" should be "Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore; Jasper admits that he loathes his life" (or use a paragraph break)
- [GRAMMAR] "Rosa takes a walk and had a tiff" should be "Rosa takes a walk and has a tiff"
- [GRAMMAR] "Sir Luke Fildes’s illustration showed Edwin as “a lad with the bloom of a lass,” with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head of long_, _thick_, _fair hair_," should be "Sir Luke Fildes’s illustration showed Edwin as “a lad with the bloom of a lass,” with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head of long, thick, fair hair_," (though this is more of a punctuation issue)

Now, let's identify coherence issues (problems with how the text flows as a whole):
- [STRUCTURE] The text is written in a somewhat archaic or formal style that may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which could affect coherence for some readers.
- [LOGIC] Some statements appear to be missing context or explanation, such as references to specific people (e.g., "Mr. Cuming Walters") without proper introduction.
- [CLARITY] Some complex sentences are difficult to follow, such as "If I was right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of “The Signalman” in _Mugby Junction_." The connection between this sentence and the previous discussion is not entirely clear.
- [LOGIC] The flow of some arguments is not always clear. For example, the transition from discussing Dickens's health to the character of John Jasper is abrupt.
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions are overly detailed or verbose, making it difficult to follow the main points.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraph breaks in some places, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas.
- [LOGIC] Some references are unclear without additional context, such as "Sir Thomas Watson reported" without explaining who Sir Thomas Watson is.

For the final scores:

Fluency Score: I would rate this as a 3.5. The text contains numerous grammatical errors that interrupt the flow and clarity. While the content is generally understandable, the many errors would require readers to pause and re-read sections to understand the meaning. The archaic language style also adds to the difficulty for modern readers.

Coherence Score: I would rate this as a 3. The text attempts to present a coherent argument about Dickens's last novel, but the flow is sometimes disrupted by abrupt transitions and unclear connections between ideas. The archaic language style also makes the text more difficult to follow for modern readers, though the content itself is generally logical and well-structured.

Let me double-check these assessments and refine them if needed.

For fluency, the text has numerous grammatical errors, but the meaning is generally clear. The errors are frequent enough to require readers to slow down and process the text carefully, but not so severe as to make understanding difficult. The style is archaic but not entirely inaccessible. I believe a 3.5 is appropriate.

For coherence, the text has a clear structure as a literary analysis, but there are some issues with transitions between ideas and occasional lack of clarity in the argument. The archaic style does make it more challenging to follow, but the overall argument is generally logical and well-structured. A 3 seems appropriate.

Actually, I think the coherence is slightly better than I initially assessed. While there are some issues with transitions and clarity, the overall structure is logical and the argument is generally well-organized. I would revise my coherence score to a 3.5 as well.

Let me finalize my assessment:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "he certainly write no longer" should be "he certainly wrote no longer"
- [GRAMMAR] "He speak to his sister-in-law" should be "He spoke to his sister-in-law"
- [GRAMMAR] "Yet, when he die in June, 1870, left three completed numbers still unpublished" should be "Yet, when he died in June, 1870, he left three completed numbers still unpublished"
- [GRAMMAR] "many efforts have been make" should be "many efforts have been made"
- [GRAMMAR] "Dickens was worked over the late Lord Lytton’s tale" should be "Dickens was working over the late Lord Lytton’s tale"
- [GRAMMAR] "a study base on deep knowledge" should be "a study based on deep knowledge"
- [GRAMMAR] "I owed much aid" should be "I owe much aid" or "I owed much aid"
