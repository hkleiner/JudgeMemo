Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the user's request. They provided a text from a religious work discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. My job is to assess its fluency and coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. 

Starting with fluency. The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which is common in older religious texts. I need to check for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, and word choice. Let me scan through the text.

Looking at the first paragraph: "is teach by the Church of England" – the verb should be "is taught". That's a grammar issue. Then, "am the true expositors" – the subject is plural ("they"), so "are" should be used. Another grammar error. "Give" in "consent is blindly give" should be "given". 

Moving on, "to had been settle" – should be "to have been settled". More grammar. "Am examined" – "are examined". "Consisted" should be "consist". "Was loyal" – "were loyal". "To was satisfied" – "to be satisfied". "Was the real point at issue" – "is the real point". "Arranged" – "arrange". 

In the next chapter, "must was directed" – "must be directed". "Do not referred" – "do not refer". "We was taught" – "we were taught". "Can there was any doubt" – "can there be any doubt". "Connect" should be "connected". "Was not now making" – "am not now making". "Was that there clearly is a connexion" – "is that there clearly is a connexion". "Most bless Saviour" – "most blessed Saviour". "Become each of them a whole Christ" – "becomes each of them a whole Christ". "Maintained that the bread and wine did not cease to have the accidents of bread and wine, so that they might still be speak of as bread and wine" – "speak" should be "spoken". "Appeared to have am introduced" – "appeared to have been introduced". "Cling to the great principles" – "clung to". "Is altogether spiritual food" – "is altogether spiritual food". "Two perfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other spiritual" – "the one material and the other spiritual". "Are warrant to expected" – "are warranted to expect". "Must not was confounded" – "must not be confounded". "To endeavoured to ascertain" – "to endeavour to ascertain". "Some was endeavoured" – "some have endeavoured". "Should was held responsible" – "should be held responsible". "Carefully study" – "carefully studied". "Had made herself responsible" – "has made herself responsible". "Beared more or less upon the subject" – "bear more or less upon the subject". "Referred to sacraments in general" – "refers to sacraments in general". "Worked invisibly in us" – "works invisibly in us". "Quicken, but also strengthen" – "quicken, and also strengthen". "Sign and seal" – "sign and seal". "Are grafted into the Church" – "are grafted into the Church". "Are visibly sign and seal" – "are visibly a sign and seal". "Describe" should be "described". "Was nowhere say to be changed" – "was nowhere said to be changed". "Are God’s direct gifts to the soul, and was never say" – "are God’s direct gifts to the soul, and were never said". "The water is sanctified" – "is sanctified". "Consecration produced no change" – "consecration produces no change". "The new birth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moved in the soul" – "moved" should be "moving". "Minister on earth visibly administered the visible sign to the body" – "administers the visible sign to the body". "We trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible gift on the soul" – "bestows". "It was not my business now to discuss" – "It is not my business now to discuss". "Enough for my present purpose to pointed out" – "enough for my present purpose to point out". "One is not change into the other" – "one is not changed into the other". "Ceased to was a sign" – "ceased to be a sign".

That's a lot of grammatical errors. Some are minor, but the sheer number affects fluency. There are also some spelling issues like "connexion" instead of "connection", but that's a stylistic choice, not an error. Syntax-wise, the sentences are long and complex, which is common in formal writing, but some are awkward. For example, "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who made it, as if they, and they only, am the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine." The structure is a bit convoluted. 

Now for coherence. The text is a logical argument, moving from introduction to the doctrine, then to the Church of England's stance, using Articles, Catechism, etc. The flow is generally logical. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, moving from discussing the Church's teachings to the Articles without a smooth transition. Also, some points are repeated, like the distinction between sign and reality in sacraments. The author sometimes digresses, like mentioning the state of the Church and the need for examination, which is relevant but could be better integrated. 

Overall, the fluency is hindered by numerous grammatical errors, which would lower the score. Coherence is mostly maintained, but with some awkward transitions and repetitions. 

Fluency score: Considering the many grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing, but the overall meaning is clear, I'd say around 3.5. 

Coherence score: The argument is logical with some minor issues in transitions and structure, so maybe 4.
