Let me analyze this text to evaluate its fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

First, I'll review the text for fluency issues:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "have ventured to publish it" - The verb tense is inconsistent with the previous sentence.
- [GRAMMAR] "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" - The capitalization of "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is unusual and the punctuation is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" - The placement of the adverb "evidently" is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "In giving the antldiluvians a description" - The word "antldiluvians" appears to be a misspelling of "antediluvians" (people living before the flood).
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" - This is likely a misspelling of "antediluvians."
- [GRAMMAR] "and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them" - This sentence is awkwardly constructed.
- [GRAMMAR] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'" - The phrase "the finger of time" is metaphorical but the construction is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" - The punctuation and parallel structure are awkward.
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" - Misspelling of "admiring."
- [SPELLING] "dimentions" - Misspelling of "dimensions."
- [GRAMMAR] "I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion" - The phrase is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "And from thence,——it was which means long river" - The punctuation and sentence structure are confusing.
- [GRAMMAR] "It is located on the 'eastward bank' of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota" - The punctuation is inconsistent.
- [GRAMMAR] "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark" - The sentence structure is awkward.
- [SPELLING] "consitutes" - Misspelling of "constitutes."
- [GRAMMAR] "The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium" - This sentence is out of context with the rest of the text.
- [GRAMMAR] "This is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of bluff formation" - The sentence structure is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman" - This sentence is out of context with the rest of the text.
- [GRAMMAR] "THE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office in the City was of thick plate-glass" - The capitalization is unusual and the sentence is out of context.
- [GRAMMAR] "But as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing" - This sentence is out of context with the rest of the text.
- [GRAMMAR] "He felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near her" - This sentence is out of context with the rest of the text.

Now, let me evaluate the fluency score based on the scale:
- The text contains multiple grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward phrasing.
- The text has several sentences that appear to be out of context with the rest of the passage.
- The text is not highly fluent, but it is generally readable.
- Based on the scale, this would be a Score 3 for fluency.

Next, I'll review the text for coherence issues:

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a collection of different narratives that are not well connected.
- [LOGIC] The text begins with a narrative about the discovery of the Garden of Eden but then shifts to a completely different narrative about a romantic triangle.
- [LOGIC] The text then shifts to a narrative about a housekeeper at Canterville Chase, which is a reference to a classic ghost story.
- [LOGIC] The text then shifts to a narrative about a life insurance office and finally to a narrative about a character named George Stransom.
- [CONTEXT] The text appears to be a compilation of different excerpts from various literary works, including religious writings, ghost stories, and possibly some serialized fiction.
- [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear overall narrative or argument.
- [COHERENCE] The transitions between different narratives are abrupt and unexplained.
- [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- [COHERENCE] The text appears to be a collection of fragments rather than a cohesive whole.

Now, let me evaluate the coherence score based on the scale:
- The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing.
- Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow.
- Based on the scale, this would be a Score 2 for coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
