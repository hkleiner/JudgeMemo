Let me analyze the text according to the given evaluation criteria.

First, I need to understand the text:
- This appears to be a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "Edwin Drood"
- It discusses Dickens's approach to plot construction in his later works
- It describes the plot, characters, and some theories about the novel's ending
- The text seems to be written in a formal, academic style

Now, let me evaluate the fluency of the text:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are occasional grammatical errors, such as "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises" - the subject-verb agreement is correct, but the sentence structure is complex.
2. [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em-dashes and parentheses that could be clearer.
3. [STYLE] The text has a somewhat archaic or formal style that might feel awkward to modern readers, with phrases like "Youth will be served" and "We did salute the happy morn."
4. [REPETITION] There is some repetition of ideas and phrases, particularly in the discussion of Dickens's writing style and his later works.
5. [PASSIVE VOICE] The text uses a lot of passive voice, which can affect readability.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (biographical information about Dickens, plot summary of Edwin Drood, character analysis) without clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] Some parts of the text seem disconnected from the main argument, such as the long description of the shop-front scene that doesn't clearly relate to the main discussion of Dickens's writing.
3. [ORGANIZATION] The flow of the text is sometimes confusing, with the author moving back and forth between analysis, summary, and commentary without clear signposting.
4. [FOCUS] The text sometimes loses focus, especially in the middle sections where it discusses characters and plot points without clearly connecting them to the main thesis about Dickens's writing style.
5. [CITATIONS] There are references to other critics (Forster, Proctor, Walters) but the connections between these citations and the main argument are sometimes unclear.

Based on the evaluation criteria provided:

FLUENCY SCORE:
The text is generally well-written with few serious grammatical errors. The complex sentence structures and formal style may be challenging for some readers, but they don't significantly impede understanding. The text is mostly fluent but has some awkward phrasing and occasional grammatical issues. I would rate this as a 4.0 (mostly fluent with minor issues).

COHERENCE SCORE:
The text has some structural and organizational issues that make it less coherent. The flow between topics is sometimes abrupt, and the connections between different parts of the argument are not always clear. While the main points are understandable, the overall structure could be improved for better coherence. I would rate this as a 3.5 (generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions).

Let me review these assessments again to ensure they align with the criteria:

FLUENCY:
- The text is generally grammatically correct but has some complex sentence structures
- There are a few awkward phrasings and some repetition
- The formal style may be challenging for some readers but doesn't make the text unreadable
- The text is mostly fluent but has minor issues that could be improved

COHERENCE:
- The text moves between different topics without always clear transitions
- Some sections seem disconnected from the main argument
- The organization could be improved for better flow
- The text is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and some confusing segments

I believe my ratings of 4.0 for fluency and 3.5 for coherence are appropriate based on the criteria provided.
