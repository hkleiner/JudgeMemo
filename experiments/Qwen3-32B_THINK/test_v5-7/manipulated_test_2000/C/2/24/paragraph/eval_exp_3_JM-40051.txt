Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll need to scan for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and repetitive structures. 

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "antldiluvians" is likely a typo for "antediluvians". There's also "dimentions" instead of "dimensions". "Hanging garden and looking over the plat" – "plat" might be a typo for "plot" or "plateau". "Admirirg" is misspelled as "admirirg". "Inhabited by the most industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people" – "christianized" should be "Christianized" with a capital C. "Bridtish" is misspelled as "British". "Constitutes" is misspelled as "consitutes". "Hightest" instead of "highest". "Ragged and jageed" – "jageed" is probably "jagged". 

Looking at grammar and syntax, there are some run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary. "In giving the antldiluvians a description of the creation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts," – this is a long sentence that could be split for clarity. 

There's also repetition in phrases like "Our garden is still in the right place. Our garden is again right." The author uses "Our garden" multiple times in quick succession, which is repetitive. 

Some parts have awkward phrasing, such as "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible," where the comma after "discovery" is misplaced. "The finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the ‘North West,’ as the place." This could be phrased more clearly. 

Moving on to coherence. The text's main idea is to argue that the Garden of Eden is located in the Mississippi River valley. However, the flow of ideas is not very logical. The author jumps between different points without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Garden of Eden, the text suddenly mentions "A mobile hotspot activated" and later "The voice-activated controls blinked to life," which seem out of place and unrelated to the main argument. These parts disrupt the coherence. 

There are also inconsistencies in the argument. The author claims the Garden of Eden is in the Mississippi River area but provides references to the Euphrates, which is a Middle Eastern river, not the Mississippi. This creates confusion. The text mentions "the Euphrates river crosses that country," but the author is actually referring to the Mississippi. This inconsistency weakens the argument. 

The structure is disorganized. The author starts with the discovery, then discusses the Bible's account, then the location in the Mississippi, then goes back to the Garden of Eden's features, and finally ends with a description of the area. There's no clear progression from one idea to the next. 

Some sentences are confusing or illogical. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the ‘North West,’ as the place." The phrase "finger of time" is unclear and doesn't logically connect to the argument. The text also mentions "a scientest" instead of "scientist," which is a spelling error but also makes the term less clear. 

There are abrupt shifts in the text, such as moving from discussing the Garden of Eden to "A smart pen recorded each word." This is a random insertion and doesn't contribute to the main argument. Similarly, the mention of "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" is another disjointed element that doesn't fit with the rest of the text. 

The author also uses hyperbolic and vague language, like "the most fertile and habitable region of earth," which is subjective and not supported by evidence. The text lacks a clear thesis and supporting evidence, making it hard to follow the argument. 

In terms of coherence, the text has a weak logical structure, inconsistent arguments, and random insertions that disrupt the flow. The author's main point is not clearly developed, and the connections between ideas are weak or absent. 

For fluency, the text has several spelling and grammatical errors, repetitive phrases, and awkward sentence structures that make it harder to read. While the overall message is understandable, the issues with fluency do affect the readability. 

Considering the evaluation criteria, I would rate the coherence as a 2 because the text has frequent inconsistencies and disjointed ideas. The fluency score would be a 3 due to multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Misspellings: "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "dimentions" (dimensions), "admirirg" (admirirg), "christianized" (Christianized), "Bridtish" (British), "consitutes" (constitutes), "hightest" (highest), "jageed" (jagged).  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and missing commas: e.g., "In giving the antldiluvians a description... he simply stated the principal facts," (awkward phrasing).  
- [REPETITION] Repetitive phrases: "Our garden is still in the right place. Our garden is again right."  
- [LEXICON] Unclear or inconsistent terminology: "Euphrates" vs. "Mississippi" (confusing biblical and geographical references).  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues: "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity..." (comma splice).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent argument: Claims Eden is in the Mississippi River valley but references the Euphrates (Middle Eastern river).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow: Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., "A mobile hotspot activated" inserted randomly).  
- [CLARITY] Vague or unsupported claims: "the most fertile and habitable region of earth" without evidence.  
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitions: Sudden jumps between ideas (e.g., from Eden to "A smart pen recorded each word").  
- [CONTRADICTION] Confusing references: "Euphrates" vs. "Mississippi" in the same argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: [2.5]  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: [3.0]
