Alright, I need to evaluate this text for both fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully to understand the content and identify any issues.

First, fluency. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, and whether the sentences flow naturally. 

The text has several instances of missing articles and prepositions. For example, "in order to invite general inspection, and criticism" is missing a preposition before "criticism" (should be "and to invite general inspection and criticism"). There's also a sentence fragment: "have ventured to publish it." It should be "I have ventured to publish it."

There are some spelling errors. "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians." "Admirirg" is misspelled as "admirirg" and should be "admiring." "Dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions" and should be "dimensions." "Scientest" is misspelled as "scientest" and should be "scientist." "Ragged and jageed" is misspelled as "jageed" and should be "jagged."

The text also uses "a stuff" multiple times where it seems like a specific term or name is intended but not properly identified. This creates confusion. For example, "the stuff of the Mississippi River" and "the a stuff of Eden." It's unclear what "stuff" refers to here, making the sentences confusing.

There are instances of repetition, such as the repeated use of "a stuff" and "the thing," which don't add clarity. The text also has some awkward phrasing, like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." This could be more concise.

Now, coherence. I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the text is organized in a way that makes sense. 

The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the location of Eden, it suddenly shifts to a description of the Mississippi River and the surrounding area without a smooth transition. This makes it hard to follow the author's argument.

There are also inconsistencies in the narrative. The author mentions that the Garden of Eden is in the Mississippi River area but then provides descriptions that don't clearly connect to the biblical account. For example, the mention of rattlesnakes and modern cities like La Crosse seems out of place in a discussion about Eden.

The text lacks a clear structure. It starts with the author's discovery, moves to a discussion of the Bible's account, then to the location in America, and finally to specific geographical features. However, the connections between these sections are weak, and the overall argument is not well-organized.

The use of "a stuff" and "the thing" throughout the text creates confusion because these terms are not defined or explained. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the author's points and how they relate to the main argument.

In terms of the fluency score, while there are multiple errors and awkward phrasings, the text is still generally readable. The errors don't completely hinder understanding, so I might rate it a 3. However, the repeated use of "a stuff" and "the thing" significantly impacts fluency. 

For coherence, the lack of clear transitions, inconsistent narrative, and undefined terms make it hard to follow the author's reasoning. The text doesn't present a logical progression of ideas, so I would rate it a 2.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles/prepositions: "in order to invite general inspection, and criticism" (missing "to" before "criticism").  
- [SPELLING] Errors: "antldiluvians" → "antediluvians"; "admirirg" → "admiring"; "dimentions" → "dimensions"; "scientest" → "scientist"; "jageed" → "jagged".  
- [SYNTAX] Sentence fragments: "have ventured to publish it" (missing subject).  
- [LEXICON] Confusing terms: Repeated use of "a stuff" and "the thing" without definition.  
- [REPETITION] Overuse of phrases like "the finger of time" and "the garden of Eden".  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Weak transitions between sections (e.g., abrupt shift from biblical analysis to Mississippi geography).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative: Jumps between claims, historical context, and local descriptions without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] Undefined terms: "a stuff"/"the thing" create ambiguity.  
- [CONTRADICTION] Inconsistent claims: Descriptions of modern cities (e.g., La Crosse) clash with Eden's biblical imagery.  
- [CONTEXT] Unclear connections between Eden's supposed location and supporting evidence (e.g., rattlesnakes, "Hanging Garden" as a modern quarry).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
