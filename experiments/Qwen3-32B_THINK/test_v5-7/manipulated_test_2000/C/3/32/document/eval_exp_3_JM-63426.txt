Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start by understanding the task. The user wants me to list issues under fluency and coherence with specific labels and then assign scores based on the provided scales.

First, fluency. The definition includes grammatical correctness, non-repetitive structure, and natural phrasing. I'll go through the text looking for any grammar issues, spelling mistakes, syntax problems, or awkward word choices.

Looking at the text, I notice some instances where words are replaced with "thing" or "stuff," which seems like placeholders or intentional omissions. For example, "in a thing, Massachusetts" and "on the ‘Narrow Gauge’ on your way to a stuff." This is likely a stylistic choice, but it might be confusing for readers. Also, there are some awkward phrases like "The two jobbers are kicked," which is unclear. Maybe a missing word here, like "The two jobbers are kicked out" or "kicked off," but without context, it's hard to tell. There are also some missing articles or prepositions, like "the Gordon press" instead of "a Gordon press," which might be a typo. 

Next, coherence. The text is a biographical narrative of Will Bradley. I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the structure makes sense. The first chapter is an introduction, and the second is about his early life. The transition between these chapters seems okay, but some parts are a bit disjointed. For example, the shift from discussing his impact on American graphic arts to his early life in Ishpeming might be abrupt. Also, the use of "thing" and "stuff" as placeholders could disrupt the flow. There are some sentences that are run-on or have unclear connections, like the part about the faker selling soap. The description is detailed but might not clearly convey the sequence of events. 

Now, applying the scoring scales. For fluency, the text has several issues with awkward phrasing and missing words, which might lower the score to a 3 or 4. The errors are noticeable but not overwhelming. For coherence, the structure is mostly logical, but the placeholders and some unclear transitions might bring it down to a 3 or 4 as well. I need to decide if the issues are minor or significant based on the scale descriptions.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of placeholder words "thing" and "stuff" instead of specific terms, creating ambiguity.  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles/prepositions (e.g., "a Gordon press" vs. "the Gordon press").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The two jobbers are kicked" (unclear verb usage).  
- [SPELLING] "pi" likely intended as "ink" (contextual error).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references like "the lower-case" (missing article).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context and biographical details.  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative flow in the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter (e.g., sudden shifts in time/setting).  
- [TRANSITION] Unclear connections between Bradley’s early life and his later artistic impact.  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague terms ("a stuff," "the thing corner") disrupts narrative cohesion.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
