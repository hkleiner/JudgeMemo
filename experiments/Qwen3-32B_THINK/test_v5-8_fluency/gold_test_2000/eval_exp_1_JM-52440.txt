Alright, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the fluency of the given text based on the criteria provided. The user wants me to list issues under specific categories like [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], etc., and then assign a score between 1 and 5. 

First, I'll read through the text carefully. It's a religious text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper according to the Church of England. The language is quite formal and archaic, which might affect fluency in modern terms. 

Looking for grammatical issues: The text uses "IT is a very easy thing..." which is in all caps. That might be a typo, but maybe it's intentional for emphasis. Then there's "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors..." The comma usage here seems okay, but the structure is a bit long. 

I notice some archaic constructions like "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England; and my desire is to ascertain..." The semicolon usage here is correct. 

Looking for spelling errors: I don't see any obvious misspellings. The words are all spelled correctly. 

Syntax issues: The sentences are long and complex. For example, "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined." This is a run-on sentence but grammatically correct. It might be a bit hard to follow, but that's more about style than fluency. 

Repetition: The phrase "the Church of England" is repeated often, which is necessary for clarity but could be considered repetitive. However, in a doctrinal discussion, repetition for emphasis is common. 

Clarity: The text is clear in its arguments but uses formal and archaic language. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject..." The use of em dashes and numbering is clear. 

Other issues: The text uses "IT" in all caps at the start of a sentence, which might be a formatting issue. Also, some phrases like "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." The structure is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. 

Considering the evaluation criteria: The scale for fluency includes grammatical correctness, non-repetitive, and common English usage. The text is grammatically correct but uses complex and archaic language. There are no spelling errors. The sentences are long but structured properly. The repetition of "the Church of England" is necessary for clarity in the context. 

Possible issues to list:
- [STYLE] Use of archaic and complex sentence structures that may be difficult for modern readers to follow.
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and commas in long sentences, which may disrupt readability.
- [REPETITION] Repeated use of "the Church of England" for emphasis, though contextually appropriate.
- [FORMAT] Inconsistent capitalization ("IT" in all caps at the start of a sentence).

Based on these points, the fluency score would be a 4. The text is mostly fluent with minor issues in style and punctuation that don't significantly hinder understanding.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [STYLE] Archaic and overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion...") that may hinder readability for modern audiences.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and run-on sentences (e.g., "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time..."), creating cognitive load.  
- [REPETITION] Excessive repetition of "the Church of England" for emphasis, though contextually justified in doctrinal discourse.  
- [FORMAT] Inconsistent capitalization ("IT" in all caps at the start of a sentence; likely a formatting error).  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
