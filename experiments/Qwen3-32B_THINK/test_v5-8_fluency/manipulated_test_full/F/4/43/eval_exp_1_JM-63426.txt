I'll evaluate the text for fluency based on the given criteria. Let me go through the text carefully to identify any issues with grammar, phrasing, structure, or clarity.

First, I'll look for grammatical issues:
- There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation
- Some sentences appear to be run-on or improperly constructed
- There are some missing articles (a, an, the)
- Some verb tenses appear inconsistent
- There are some missing prepositions

Now, I'll look for phrasing issues:
- Some word order is awkward or unnatural
- There are some awkward transitions between ideas
- Some phrases are repetitive
- Some sentences are overly complex or difficult to follow

I'll now go through the text to identify specific issues:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This sentence is incoherent and lacks proper structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed." The phrase "whose hasn’t?" is awkward and unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing." This sentence is incoherent.
- [STRUCTURE] "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that." This is a run-on sentence with poor structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "You the even your of skill the feeding and cutting do; but the is at at flimsy marvel which boys-wonder slippery jogging sheets with hand greater these and." This sentence is incoherent.
- [STRUCTURE] "It fill is that for setting fail understood by drawing will you in when type orders." This sentence has poor structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "You Kasten designs lancing-McClurg the stationery are free and for making now of Mr. department." This sentence has poor grammar and structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "Joe Lyendecker covers is in for paper color bound-designing novels." This sentence has poor grammar.
- [STRUCTURE] "There is little more to tell, unless you want to listen to the way I enthuse about our present-day illustrators, their delightfully imaginative composition and masterly use of color. They are grand campaigners! God love them and the editorial lads who give them opportunity and encouragement. They are making an old man mighty happy--yes, making him envy their fun while he is relegated to sheer laziness in the siesta sun of California." This is a long, run-on sentence that could be broken into shorter, more digestible parts.
- [GRAMMAR] "All such steadily growing advances present opportunities which were nonexistent back in my own youthful days. Together of any they changed by in have superior far wonderful, youth opportunities fraught I training with enjoyed today knew with a into new the the beyond Nineties the world conditions." This sentence is incoherent and has poor structure.
- [STRUCTURE] "When asked magazine an for by McClure-provide I athen the, in opportunity to lay presented a purchase, Hearst in Mr. new the apply ’s reveled recent out suggestions to report." This sentence has poor structure and is difficult to understand.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5

The text has numerous grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and structural problems that significantly impact readability. While there are some clear and well-written passages, the many errors and incoherent sections make the text difficult to follow in places. The score of 2.5 reflects that the text contains frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, though some segments are clear and comprehensible.
