Let me analyze the text for fluency issues and then assign a score according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll go through the text looking for:
- Grammar issues
- Spelling mistakes
- Syntax problems
- Lexicon/word choice issues
- Clarity
- Awkward phrasing
- Repetitive language
- Issues with common English usage

This appears to be a theological treatise about the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. The language is formal, archaic, and complex, which is expected for this type of text. However, I need to focus on fluency issues rather than content or style.

Looking through the text, I notice several issues:

1) Grammar Issues:
- "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is."
- "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far."
- "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour."
- "Thee be unto: 'sacrifice is ourselves Lord bodies Here sentence, O and, holy, and to reasonable offer, our unto lively Thee, next, and we souls a present.'"
- "It the may the be to as changes a fourth specimen of refer rubric to sufficient made."

2) Spelling Issues:
- "consecrated" appears with and without the "d" at the end
- "consecrated" vs "consecrated"
- "consecrated" vs "consecrated"

3) Syntax Problems:
- "And if we look carefully, shall we not find it there?" (inverted word order that's awkward)
- "But there is yet another most important document, and one inexpressibly precious to the heart of every devout communicant amongst us: I mean the Communion Service, or 'Order of Administration of the Lord's Supper, or Holy Communion.'"
- "But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is the doctrine taught in them."
- "But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is the doctrine taught in them."

4) Lexicon/Word Choice Issues:
- "In doing this, our first business is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of her own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the assertion that she teaches what is commonly called 'The Doctrine of the Real Presence.'"
- "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed 'The Doctrine of the Real Presence,' is taught by the Church of England"

5) Clarity Issues:
- "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." - This sentence is extremely unclear
- "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour." - This sentence is incoherent
- "Thee be unto: 'sacrifice is ourselves Lord bodies Here sentence, O and, holy, and to reasonable offer, our unto lively Thee, next, and we souls a present.'" - This sentence is incoherent
- "It the may the be to as changes a fourth specimen of refer rubric to sufficient made." - This sentence is incoherent

6) Awkward Phrasing:
- "But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is the doctrine taught in them."
- "But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is the doctrine taught in them."
- "But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is the doctrine taught in them."

7) Repetitive Language:
- The phrase "the Church of England" is repeated frequently
- The phrase "the real presence" is repeated frequently

8) Common English Usage Issues:
- The text uses very formal and archaic language that is not common in modern English
- The text uses complex sentence structures that are not typical in everyday English

After reviewing all these issues, I'll now rate the fluency of the text according to the given scale:

Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity.
Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure.
Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented.

Given the issues I identified, particularly the grammatical errors, incoherent sentences, and awkward phrasing, I would rate this text a 2.5. It is generally readable and follows a logical structure, but contains enough grammatical and phrasing issues that make comprehension difficult at times.

Actually, let me reconsider this. While there are definite issues with grammar and clarity in some places, the text is mostly readable and the author is clearly expressing complex theological ideas. The archaic and formal language is appropriate for the subject matter, and the structure is mostly coherent. I would revise my score to a 3.5.

Let me double-check the text one more time to make sure I haven't missed anything.

I see more issues with incoherent sentences like:
- "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far."
- "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour."
- "Thee be unto: 'sacrifice is ourselves Lord bodies Here sentence, O and, holy, and to reasonable offer, our unto lively Thee, next, and we souls a present.'"
- "It the may the be to as changes a fourth specimen of refer rubric to sufficient made."

These sentences are particularly problematic. They appear to be fragments or incomplete thoughts that don't make sense.

Given these issues, I would rate the text a 2.5 for fluency. While the text is mostly readable and the author is expressing complex ideas, the grammatical errors and incoherent sentences significantly impact the fluency and readability.

Actually, let me review one more time. I notice that the text has some typographical errors, but many of the issues I identified are likely intentional based on the content (e.g., the complex theological language). The archaic style is appropriate for a theological treatise. The major issues are the incoherent sentences that make comprehension difficult.

Given all these considerations, I would rate the text a 2.5 for fluency.

Wait, I want to be absolutely sure. Let me look at the text again to see if the incoherent sentences are just typos or if they're actually in the text.

Looking at the sentence "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." - This sentence is definitely incoherent and doesn't make sense as written.

Similarly, "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." is also incoherent.

There are several other sentences that are similarly incoherent.

Given these issues, I would say the text is at a 2.5 on the fluency scale. The text is generally readable and the author is expressing complex ideas, but there are enough grammatical errors and incoherent sentences that make comprehension difficult at times.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." - This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." - This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour." - This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "Thee be unto: 'sacrifice is ourselves Lord bodies Here sentence, O and, holy, and to reasonable offer, our unto lively Thee, next, and we souls a present.'" - This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "It the may the be to as changes a fourth specimen of refer rubric to sufficient made." - This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "And if we look carefully, shall we not find it there?" - The inverted word order is awkward and unidiomatic.
- [GRAMMAR] "But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is the doctrine taught in them." - This sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly worded.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
