Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text according to the specified criteria. The text is about someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley. 

First, I need to identify fluency issues. The definition says fluency is about grammatically correct sentences, non-repetitive, and common English usage. Let me start by scanning for obvious grammar mistakes, awkward phrasing, or repetition.

Looking at the first paragraph: "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-" The title has some capitalization issues and the hyphen at the end is odd. 

Next, the sentence: "On the principle of “first know you are right, then go ahead,” I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The phrase "first know you are right" is a bit awkward, maybe "first know that you are right" would be better. 

Then there's a paragraph that starts with "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The structure here is a bit clunky. The sentence "In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he, man family the the new one, to nor thus consequently in out or—and and been how Noah the the, of a principal facts that one and not—giving stated destroyed a him the on and to, to of how a his, since the country, admitted mankind and present location creation; it of the point find being, then them, a somewhere description not be gave; could, has first, and themselves simply knew where was kept, it was able them of with he antldiluvians cause location, and all earth corrupted though then profound speculation on." This is a mess. It's a run-on sentence with no clear structure, making it hard to understand. There are missing words, incorrect word order, and non-sensical phrases. 

The author also uses archaic language and some words that don't fit, like "antldiluvians" (probably "antediluvians"). There are multiple instances of repetition, like "the the new one," "the the," etc. 

Looking at the sentence: "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place." The phrase "the finger of time" is a bit odd. 

There are also some awkward phrasings like "the discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." The word "admirirg" is misspelled as "admirirg" instead of "admir-ing." Also, "plat" is used, which is a technical term but might be confusing without context. 

Repetition is a problem: the author uses phrases like "Come and see!" multiple times. There's also a lot of run-on sentences and fragments. For example: "Since of commenced idea not have my, but with reality possible, while are claiming mocked, publish becoming the to possible only others a being views impressed some its, highly I probable." This is incoherent. 

The text is filled with run-on sentences and fragments that don't make sense. There are also some misspellings like "admirirg" and "euphony" vs. "euphony" (correct). The author uses archaic or overly formal language which might not be the issue, but combined with the structure issues, it makes reading difficult. 

Another example: "The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations of facts well known to the antideluvians." The term "antideluvians" is correct but might be obscure. 

The author also uses some non-standard phrasing like "It is located on the “eastward bank” of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota." The lack of a comma before "and Winona Minnesota" could be an issue. 

There are several instances where the author uses phrases that are not clear, like "The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to be the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable, easily cultivated, and adapted to gardening." The comparison is a bit confusing. 

The text also has some awkward transitions between ideas, making the flow of the argument hard to follow. For example, the author jumps from describing the geography to making claims about the Garden of Eden without clear connections. 

In the section discussing the author's personal experiences and observations, there are long, unbroken sentences that are hard to parse. For example: "Once, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden, and standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman, who was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted my attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, “See! (pointing) O see, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!” (as if he had never before seen its equal.) “There, if an artist should paint that, they would say, ‘That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy’; but there is the foundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up to the reality.”" This is a very long sentence with multiple clauses that could be broken down for clarity.

The author also uses some phrases that are not standard, like "Heald’s quarry," which might be a proper noun but is presented without context. 

There are also some instances where the author uses alliteration or poetic language that might be stylistic choices but could be seen as awkward if overdone. 

Overall, the text has numerous grammatical errors, run-on sentences, fragments, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. The repetition of phrases like "Come and see!" and the use of archaic language add to the issues. The author's attempt to blend scientific and religious arguments leads to some confusing transitions and unclear explanations. 

Given the scale, a score of 2 seems appropriate. The text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure that make comprehension difficult without effort. While some parts are readable, the overall fluency is poor.
