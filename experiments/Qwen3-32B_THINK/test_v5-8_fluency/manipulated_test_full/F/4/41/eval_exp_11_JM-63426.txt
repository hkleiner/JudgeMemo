Let me analyze the text for fluency issues according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, non-repetitive language, and adherence to common English usage with clear meanings.

Looking at the text, I notice it appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. It contains multiple chapters and is quite lengthy, with detailed descriptions of his life and career.

- "tov" should be "to"
- "mNineties" should be "in the Nineties"
