Let me analyze the text for fluency issues according to the given criteria. I'll go through the text systematically, looking for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, repetition, and issues with clarity or common English usage.

First, I'll identify the main issues:

1) Grammar and syntax issues:
- Subject-verb agreement errors
- Incorrect verb tenses
- Missing articles or prepositions
- Improper use of commas and other punctuation

2) Spelling issues:
- Misspelled words
- Inconsistent capitalization

3) Lexical issues:
- Word choice problems
- Misused words or phrases
- Repetition of words
- Improper collocations

4) Clarity and common English usage:
- Ambiguous or unclear sentences
- Awkward phrasing
- Unnatural expressions
