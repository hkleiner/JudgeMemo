I need to evaluate the fluency of the given text using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me carefully go through the text and identify any fluency issues.

First, let me understand what fluency means in this context: it measures the quality of individual sentences, whether they are grammatically correct, non-repetitive, and in accord with common English usage with clear meanings.

Looking at the text, I notice it's a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The text appears to be a literary work, and the language is somewhat archaic, which is appropriate for the style of the period.

Now, I'll identify any fluency issues:

1. Grammatical issues:
   - "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred."
   - "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish."
   - "The conversation in no way turn upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena."
   - "At eleven o'clock the family retired, and by half-past all the lights were out."
   - "He had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and they started on their drive in high spirits."
   - "The twins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writing-master"

   - "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world woulded induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight."
   - "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world woulded induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight."
   - "He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade."
   - "He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade."

   - "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world woulded induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight."
