Let me analyze this text for fluency issues according to the evaluation criteria. I'll identify grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and other issues that affect the readability of the text.

First, I'll go through the text systematically and note any fluency problems:

1) Grammar Issues:
- "coulded compensate" - This is incorrect; should be "could compensate"
- "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason" - This is awkward and possibly grammatically incorrect
- "He spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers." - "numbers" is ambiguous and unclear
- "Many efforts have am made to decipher his purpose" - "have am made" is grammatically incorrect; should be "have been made"
- "He saw in his vision, "that", I never saw "that" before." - The quotation marks and punctuation are problematic
- "there was two specimens" - Should be "there were two specimens"
- "he might have go to the limited extent" - Should be "he might have gone to the limited extent"
- "We may be sure that he was to see "that" in real life." - The quotation marks and punctuation are problematic
- "He has met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." - "at will" is awkwardly placed
- "He has met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." - "at will" is awkwardly placed
- "He was to had been detected" - Should be "He was to have been detected"
- "He would had been detected" - Should be "He would have been detected"
- "He would have learned something quite new" - Should be "He would have learned something quite new"
- "He would have learned something quite new, and very important—that the hag was hunting Jasper." - The punctuation is awkward
- "We do not hear that Helena ever opened a book: we do know that education had been denied to her." - The colon usage is awkward
- "He would not be afraid also to dye his eyebrows black" - The wording is awkward
