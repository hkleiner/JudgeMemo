Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. Let me read through it carefully and note any issues.

First, the text is a long, detailed description of a supposed location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. The author is quite passionate and uses a lot of descriptive language. Let me break it down.

I notice several grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "In gave the antldiluvians a description..." has a missing "has" or "gave" after "In". Also, "antldiluvians" is misspelled (should be "antediluvians"). 

There are instances of subject-verb agreement issues. Like "have ventured to publish it" – the subject is "I", so it should be "have ventured" but the tense might need to be "have ventured". Wait, actually, the correct form would be "have ventured" if the subject is "I", which it is. But the sentence is "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The "have ventured" is correct here as the subject is "I", but the sentence is a bit awkward in structure.

Spelling errors: "antldiluvians" is misspelled. Also, "admirirg" should be "admir ing" (missing "i"). "Dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"). "Euphony" is correct, but "euphonious" is used correctly in some contexts. "Jageed" is misspelled (should be "jagged"). "Beatiful" is misspelled (should be "beautiful"). "Decora’s Peak" is mentioned with an apostrophe, but it's a proper noun, so maybe it's correct. 

Syntax and structure: Some sentences are very long and run-on, making it hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man to dwell..." is a long run-on with multiple clauses. Also, the use of em dashes and commas is inconsistent. 

Idioms and phrases: "Of course I had never given it thought" – the correct phrase is "given it a thought". "The finger of time has am plainly pointing" – "am" is incorrect; should be "is". "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity..." – the comma after "discovery" is unnecessary. "Standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery..." – "admirirg" is misspelled, and the sentence structure is a bit awkward. 

Repetition: The text repeats phrases like "Come and see!" multiple times. Also, there's repetition in describing the same locations from different angles. 

Punctuation: There are missing commas and incorrect use of dashes. For example, "the Mississippi—the bible Euphrates—river" – the em dashes are used here, but maybe en dashes or commas would be better. Also, "Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names." – "euphony" is correct, but the sentence is a bit abrupt. 

Clarity: Some parts are unclear due to the dense description. For example, "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should was sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed..." – the phrase "should was sought" is grammatically incorrect. 

Consistency: The author uses "Euphrates" and "Mississippi" interchangeably, but it's not always clear. Also, "antideluvians" is used, but the correct term might be "antediluvians". 

Overall, the text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and long, run-on sentences that affect fluency. However, the content is coherent and the author's message is understandable despite the issues. The errors are frequent enough to lower the fluency score, but not so severe that the text is unreadable.
