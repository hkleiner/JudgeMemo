Alright, let's take a look at this text and assess its fluency based on the given criteria. First, I need to identify any issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexicon that might affect the fluency.

Starting with grammar, there are a few instances where the structure seems off. For example, "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT," – the use of "thing" instead of a proper noun like "thing" or "The Independent" is confusing. Similarly, phrases like "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" – "reasonable thing" doesn't make sense here, probably a typo for "reasonable thing" or another term. 

Looking at spelling, there are several misspelled words. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians," "admirirg" is "admir-ing" with a missing 'n,' "dimentions" should be "dimensions," and "jageed" is likely "jagged." Other examples include "euphony" (correct) but "euphonious" is misspelled as "euphony" in another part. 

Syntax-wise, some sentences are awkwardly constructed. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The placement of "evidently" and the structure makes it a bit jarring. Also, "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." The sentence is long and could be split for clarity. 

Lexical issues include the use of "thing" repeatedly where a specific term is needed, like "the thing" instead of a proper name. There's also inconsistency in terms, such as "the stuff" used multiple times, which is unclear. Additionally, some words are repeated unnecessarily, like "river" and "garden" which could be varied for better flow. 

There are also some punctuation issues, such as missing commas in complex sentences and incorrect use of hyphens. For example, "the veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place..." – the colon and capitalization after "Eden" should be a comma or period. 

Overall, the text has multiple grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward sentence structures, and unclear or repeated terms. However, despite these issues, the main ideas are generally understandable. The errors do not completely hinder comprehension but do make the reading experience less smooth and professional.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" – "reasonable thing" is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear.  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "jageed" (should be "jagged").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere" – misplaced adverb "evidently" disrupts flow.  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "the thing" and "the stuff" as placeholders for unclear terms (e.g., "the thing" instead of specific names).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT," – colon misuse).  
- [REPETITION] Overuse of "river," "garden," and "Eden" without variation, reducing readability.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5  
The text contains frequent grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward syntax that disrupt comprehension. While the core ideas are discernible, the repetitive use of placeholder terms ("the thing," "the stuff") and inconsistent phrasing significantly hinder fluency. Some sentences are overly complex or lack clarity, requiring effort to parse.
