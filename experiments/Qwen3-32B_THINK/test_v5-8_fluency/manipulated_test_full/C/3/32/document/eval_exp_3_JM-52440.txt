Let me analyze the text for fluency issues according to the evaluation criterion provided. I'll go through the text systematically to identify any grammatical, syntactic, or lexical issues that might affect fluency.

First, I'll look for common fluency issues such as:
- Grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, etc.)
- Spelling mistakes
- Awkward syntax or sentence structure
- Repetition of phrases or words
- Unnatural phrasing or expressions
- Confusing or unclear meanings

Now, I'll go through the text and identify specific issues:

1) Fluency Issues:

[GRAMMAR] - There are a few grammatical issues. For example, in the first paragraph, "the thing" is used repeatedly without clear antecedent. Also, "But those who are loyal to a stuff" - "a stuff" seems to be a placeholder or error.

[LEXICON] - The text contains some unusual or archaic word choices that could be confusing to modern readers, such as "a stuff" and "the thing" which appear to be placeholders or errors.

[REPETITION] - There is some repetition of phrases like "the Church of England" and "the thing" that could be reduced for better flow.

[REPETITION] - The phrase "the real objective presence" is repeated frequently.

[REPETITION] - The word "the" is overused in some places, creating a monotonous rhythm.

[REPETITION] - The phrase "the body and blood of Christ" is repeated frequently throughout the text.

[SYNTAX] - Some sentences are very long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "The Reformers knew well enough what Rome meant by 'transubstantiation,'..." is quite long and complex.

[SYNTAX] - Some sentences have awkward structure that makes them harder to follow, such as "It is my conviction that this looseness in the use of the word 'Sacrament' had led to great confusion; for when those who hold the great doctrines of the thing have declared their belief in the presence of their blessed Redeemer in the Sacrament..."

[SYNTAX] - Some sentences are missing clear subject-verb agreement or have confusing pronoun references.

[STYLE] - The text has a very formal, archaic style that may be considered less fluent by modern standards, but this is more of a stylistic choice than a fluency issue per se.

[STYLE] - The text contains some archaic expressions like "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" that sound somewhat awkward in modern English.

[STYLE] - The text has a very dense, theological style that may be difficult for some readers to follow, but this is more of a content choice than a fluency issue.

Overall, while there are some minor grammatical and stylistic issues, the text is generally well-written and clear. The author has a strong command of the English language and presents complex theological concepts in a coherent manner. The issues I've identified are relatively minor and don't significantly impact the overall fluency of the text.

Based on the evaluation criterion, I would rate this text as a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent and well-structured, with only minor issues in grammar or phrasing that don't disrupt the overall readability. The author has a clear command of the language and presents complex ideas in a coherent manner, even if the style is somewhat formal and archaic.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff" and "the thing" are used repeatedly without clear antecedents, creating confusion.  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or unclear word choices, such as "a stuff" and "the thing," may be distracting.  
- [REPETITION] Frequent repetition of phrases like "the Church of England," "the real objective presence," and "the body and blood of Christ" reduces variety.  
- [SYNTAX] Several long, complex sentences with awkward structures, such as: "The Reformers knew well enough what Rome meant by 'transubstantiation,'... it is difficult for any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as this."  
- [STYLE] The text has a very formal, archaic tone with expressions like "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" that may feel unnatural to modern readers.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
