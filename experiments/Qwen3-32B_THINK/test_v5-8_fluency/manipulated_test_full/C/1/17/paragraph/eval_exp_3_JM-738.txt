Alright, I need to evaluate the text for fluency according to the given criteria. Let me read through it carefully and identify any issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexis.

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel" - the parallel structure is inconsistent.
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have incorrect preposition usage: "He abandoned a new series of Readings. We think of Scott’s earlier seizures of a similar kind" - "of" should be "from" in the second sentence.
- [GRAMMAR] There are run-on sentences and missing punctuation. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel" - this sentence is overly long and needs to be broken up.
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have incorrect pronoun usage: "He was conspicuously defunct!" - "He" is unclear as the subject here.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and confusing: "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_." This sentence is difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] There are some archaic or unusual word choices that make comprehension more difficult: "Youth will be served;" - the phrase is archaic and doesn't flow naturally in modern English.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have misplaced modifiers: "He had met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." The modifier "for no other purpose" is misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] There are instances of incorrect capitalization: "He was painting masterpieces that make his name live." The phrase "painting masterpieces" should not be capitalized.
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have incorrect article usage: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." Missing article before "University."
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is inconsistent: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." This should be "a respected engineer and a university man."
- [GRAMMAR] There are some incorrect verb forms: "He had met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." The phrase "to obtain access at will" is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have incorrect preposition usage: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." It should be "a university man."
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward phrasing that makes them difficult to understand: "He had met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." The sentence is confusing and needs to be rephrased.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some incorrect pronoun references: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." The pronoun "He" is ambiguous.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have incorrect parallel structure: "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel." The structure is inconsistent.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some instances of incorrect word form: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." It should be "a university man."
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward word order: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." The word order is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some instances of incorrect capitalization: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." "University" should not be capitalized unless it's part of a proper noun.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some instances of incorrect punctuation: "He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man." The punctuation is incorrect.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

The text contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and complex sentence structures that make it difficult to read and understand. While the overall content is coherent and the ideas are clear, the frequent grammatical and syntactic issues significantly impact the fluency. The text is readable but requires effort to comprehend due to these issues.
