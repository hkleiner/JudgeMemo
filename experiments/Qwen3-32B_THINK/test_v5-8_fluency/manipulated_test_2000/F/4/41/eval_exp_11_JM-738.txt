Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text on a scale from 1 to 5, using half-points. The text is an academic article analyzing Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." Let me go through it carefully to identify any issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, or other aspects of fluency.

1) First, I'll look for grammatical errors:
- "He deserfed Dickens" - "deserfed" is misspelled; it should be "deserted."
- "romam policier" - "romam" is misspelled; it should be "roman."
- "apopldxy" - "apopldxy" is misspelled; it should be "apoplexy."
- "oeft side" - "oeft" is misspelled; it should be "left."
- "seuzures" - "seuzures" is misspelled; it should be "seizures."
- "notvout of reason" - "notvout" appears to be a typo; it should be "not out."
- "not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_." - This is missing a comma after "not unpleasant."
- "atmosphers" - "atmosphers" is misspelled; it should be "atmosphere."
- "x lack of softness" - "x" is used instead of "a."
- "kpium den" - "kpium" is misspelled; it should be "opium."
- "fromcthe life" - "fromcthe" is a typo; it should be "from the."
- "half-conceaoed" - "conceaoed" is misspelled; it should be "concealed."
- "there arectwo specimens" - "arectwo" is a typo; it should be "are two."
- "thebsupernormal" - "thebsupernormal" is a typo; it should be "the supernatural."

2) Next, I'll check for syntax issues:
- "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, 'smacked of the apoplexy.'" - This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be something like "We think that, like Scott’s earlier seizures of a similar kind, after which he said _Peveril_ 'smacked of the apoplexy.'"
- "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers." - The colon usage is correct, but the sentence could be clearer if it were split or rephrased.
- "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before." - The quotation marks and punctuation need to be properly placed.
- "We may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life." - The quotation marks are correctly used, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward.
- "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in _Mugby Junction_." - The phrase "too material premonitions" is awkward and could be clearer.

3) Now, let me look for issues with word choice or lexicon:
- "Youth will be served;" - The semicolon is used correctly, but the phrase "Youth will be served" is somewhat archaic and could be more clearly expressed as "Youth will be served, however."
- "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _romam policier_, careful study of character." - The phrase "combined with some of the elements" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
- "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises." - "ajd" is a typo for "and."
- "Mr. Grewgious may be caricatured too much, but notvout of reason;" - "notvout" is a typo for "not out."
- "Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_." - The phrase "in not unpleasant contrast" is somewhat awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

4) Looking for repetition or redundancy:
- The text is an academic analysis, so some repetition is expected as it discusses different aspects of the novel and its characters. However, there is no excessive or distracting repetition that would impact fluency negatively.

5) Checking for coherence and logical flow:
- The text is well-structured as an academic analysis, moving from introduction to analysis of the story and its characters. However, there are some minor issues with sentence structure and punctuation that could affect the flow.

6) Other issues:
- The text contains some archaic or formal language that is appropriate for an academic analysis but may be less common in modern English.
- There are some typographical errors that could affect readability, particularly the misspelled words and typos.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent and well-structured as an academic analysis. However, there are several grammatical errors, misspellings, and typographical errors that impact fluency. These issues are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand, but they are noticeable and would benefit from proofreading and editing.

Let me now summarize these issues in bullet points with appropriate labels and then provide a final score:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [SPELLING] "deserfed" should be "deserted."

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

The text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.

However, the overall meaning is clear and the text is well-structured as an academic analysis.
