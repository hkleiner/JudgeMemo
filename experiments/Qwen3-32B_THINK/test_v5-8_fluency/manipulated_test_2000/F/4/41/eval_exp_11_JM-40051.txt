- "locayion" is likely a typo for "location"
- "thr" is likely a typo for "the"
- "destitute of money mineral wealth" is awkward phrasing; "destitute of monetary mineral wealth" would be better
- "acclimate" should be "acclimatize"
- "prlper dimentions" is likely a typo for "proper dimensions"

- "jt" is likely a typo for "it"
