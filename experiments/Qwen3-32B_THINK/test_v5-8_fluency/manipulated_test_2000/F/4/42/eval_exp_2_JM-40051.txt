Alright, let's evaluate the fluency of this text. Fluency measures how well the sentences are structured, their grammatical correctness, and how natural and clear they are. I need to identify issues in grammar, syntax, vocabulary usage, and sentence flow.

Looking at the text:

1) Grammar Issues:
- "had venture to published it" - The verb tenses and forms are incorrect. It should be "had ventured to publish it"
- "had been presented to me, or as I had discovered them" - The verb tense is inconsistent
- "was being settled and inhabit by the most industrious..." - "inhabit" should be "inhabited"
- "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lose the reality'" - "lose" should be "lost"
- "must be see to was appreciated" - "see" should be "seen" and "was" should be "be"
- "the top of this hanging garden had its slopes..." - "had" is incorrect; should be "has"
- "this hung garden has been notable and notorious..." - "hung" should be "hanging"
- "the serpents have been destroy, or was disappearing" - "destroy" should be "destroyed" and "was" should be "are"
- "At present this 'wild scenery' was being effaced..." - "was" should be "is"

2) Syntax Issues:
- "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then went ahead,' I have been very slow..." - The phrase "first know you are right, then went ahead" is awkward and lacks parallel structure
- "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I had a reasonable thing of it" - The phrase "a reasonable thing of it" is unclear and awkward
- "In gave the antldiluvians a description of the creation..." - This sentence has incorrect word order and is confusing
- "and it not being on that continent, he could not pointed it out to them" - The sentence structure is awkward and the verb form is incorrect
- "But of this last fact I is ignorant when I made the discovery..." - The subject-verb agreement is incorrect ("I is" should be "I am")
- "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" - The punctuation and structure make this awkward
- "standing on the hung garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery" - The sentence structure is awkward and the verb "admirirg" is misspelled
- "I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This was the garden of Eden" - The comma splice is incorrect
- "and should was sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed" - The verb form is incorrect
- "But it shoulded be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual growth" - "shoulded" is incorrect; should be "should be"
- "I have relate the facts as they have been presented to me" - "relate" should be "related"

3) Vocabulary/Word Choice Issues:
- "antldiluvians" - This is likely a misspelling of "antediluvians" (people who lived before the flood)
- "admirirg" - Misspelling of "admirirg" should be "admiring"
- "mighted was its proper dimentions" - "mighted" is incorrect; should be "might have been" and "dimentions" is misspelled (should be "dimensions")
- "pleased noticed" - "pleased" should be "please"
- "know to be the richest land in the world" - "know" should be "known"
- "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lose the reality'" - "dog" is an odd word choice here
- "the 'Face of a King'" - This is an odd phrase that doesn't clearly convey meaning
- "the 'Father of Waters'" - This is a metaphor that's not clearly explained
- "the 'Land of good gold'" - This is an awkward phrase

4) Repetition Issues:
- "Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth..." - "Our garden" is repeated unnecessarily
- "Our garden is again right." - "Our garden" is repeated unnecessarily
- "Our garden is still in the right place." - "Our garden" is repeated unnecessarily
- "the 'Father of Waters,' courses, run, and play their dances." - This is repetitive and awkward
- "the 'Laughing' and 'Father of waters,' courses, run, and play their dances." - This is repetitive and awkward

5) Sentence Flow and Cohesion Issues:
- The text often jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions
- Some sentences are very long and lack proper punctuation, making them difficult to follow
- There are many abrupt shifts in perspective and subject matter
- The text uses a lot of exclamation points and rhetorical questions, which disrupt the flow
- The text often uses phrases like "Now, please, place yourself with me..." which create an awkward tone and disrupt the flow

6) Spelling Errors:
- "admirirg" - misspelled as "admirirg" should be "admiring"
- "dimentions" - misspelled as "dimentions" should be "dimensions"
- "antldiluvians" - misspelled as "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians"
- "mighted was" - "mighted" is not a standard word form
- "pleased noticed" - "pleased" is incorrect; should be "please"
- "know to be" - "know" should be "known"
- "jageed" - misspelled as "jageed" should be "jagged"
- "was being effaced" - "was" is incorrect; should be "is"
- "was being settled and inhabit" - "inhabit" should be "inhabited"

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency of this text as a 2.5. The text has frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure. While there are some clear and well-written sentences, the overall readability is significantly impacted by the many issues. The text is often difficult to understand without effort, but not so bad that it's completely unintelligible. The author's ideas are present, but the poor fluency makes it challenging to follow the argument.
