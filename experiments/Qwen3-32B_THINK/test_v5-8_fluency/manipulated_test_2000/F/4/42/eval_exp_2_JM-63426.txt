Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a text and wants me to assess its fluency using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to go through the text carefully to spot any issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexicon.

Starting with the first chapter, "AN INTRODUCTION." I notice some capitalization issues. The first sentence is in all caps: "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK." That might be intentional for emphasis, but it's inconsistent with the rest of the text. Then there's a line: "he romp like a breeze..." The verb should be "romps" instead of "romp" for present tense consistency. 

Looking at the next paragraph: "It shoulded be talked about..." The correct past tense of "should" is "should have," so "should have been talked about" would be correct. Also, "hard to realized" should be "hard to realize." 

In the section about the 19th Century: "Morris failing to revived medievalism..." The correct form is "failing to revive." Then "Beardsley, the Yellow Book and their avant garde galaxy..." The possessive might be off here. Should it be "Beardsley and the Yellow Book's avant-garde galaxy"? Also, "avant garde" should be hyphenated as "avant-garde."

Next, "Toulouse-Lautrec spread modern art..." The correct past tense is "spread" but the context might require "was spreading" for ongoing action. "Barriers being demolish everywhere." The correct past participle is "demolished."

Moving to the American section: "It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir..." The correct structure is "made the American public stir" or "made the American public stir." Also, "the only pious ambition" might be better as "the only pious ambition was..." 

In the second chapter, "It was graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse..." The sentence is okay, but there's a mix of past and present tenses in the narrative. "Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear!" Here, "is" is present tense, but the story is in past tense. Should be "was." 

Looking at the line: "You carried finished work back..." The correct past tense is "carried," but the context might need "carried" if it's past, but the sentence is in past tense. Wait, "You carried" is correct, but the following "for each trip you are paid" should be "were paid." 

There's a sentence: "Your father is drawing cartoons..." Again, present tense in a past context. Should be "was drawing." 

In the part about the father's illness: "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget." The structure is okay, but "He gave you much fine advice..." would be correct. 

The sentence: "He tells you he hasn’t long to live, said you have been a good boy..." The tenses are mixed. Should be "He told you he didn’t have long to live..." 

There's a line: "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'..." The correct form is "You were." 

Another issue: "It will be made to lasted until..." The correct form is "made to last." 

In the part about the uncle bringing a watch: "Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch." The present tense "brings" is inconsistent with the past narrative. Should be "brought." 

There's a sentence: "Your mother kept house for your cousins." The tense is correct, but "kept" is past, which matches the context. 

Looking at: "You are now a worked man--wages three dollars a week." The phrase "worked man" is awkward. It should be "worker" or "worked man" might be a typo for "worker." 

Another issue: "The print shop is above a saloon and in one corner of a big barn of a room..." The phrasing is a bit convoluted and could be clearer. 

There's a sentence: "He offered you eight dollars a week. You are not that important..." The tenses are mixed. "You are" should be "you were." 

In the section about Iron Ore moving: "You are now thirteen and Mr. Newett offers you ten dollars..." The tenses are correct here. 

Overall, there are numerous instances of incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and awkward phrasing. The text is written in a narrative style, so consistency in tense is crucial. There are also some spelling errors and incorrect word forms. However, the overall meaning is generally clear despite these issues. The text is readable but has enough errors to affect fluency. 

Considering the evaluation criteria, a score of 3 seems appropriate because there are multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow and clarity. The text is readable but requires effort to understand at times due to the errors.
