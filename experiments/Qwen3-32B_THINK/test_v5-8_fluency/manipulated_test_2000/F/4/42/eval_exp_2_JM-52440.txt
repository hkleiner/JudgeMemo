Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the fluency of the given text on a scale from 1 to 5, using the provided criteria. The evaluation should be based on grammatical correctness, non-repetitive phrasing, adherence to common English usage, and clear meaning.

First, I'll read through the text to get a general sense of its fluency. The text is a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. It's quite dense and formal, which is typical for such subjects, but I need to focus on fluency issues.

Looking for grammatical errors: I notice several instances where verb tenses and subject-verb agreement are incorrect. For example, "teach by the Church of England" should be "taught by." Also, "am the true expositors" should be "are." These are clear grammatical issues.

Next, awkward phrasing and non-standard usage: Phrases like "was supposed to had been settle" should be "had been settled." "It is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently hear" uses "hear" instead of "heard." These are errors in verb forms.

Repetition: The text uses phrases like "was not now making any assertion" and "was not now discussing," which might be repetitive in structure. However, repetition of structure for emphasis might be intentional in formal writing, so this might not be a major issue.

Clarity and coherence: The text is complex and uses formal language, but it's generally clear in its argument. However, some sentences are long and could be broken down for better readability. For example, "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently hear, and her own teaching honestly examined." This sentence is a bit convoluted but still understandable.

Now, categorizing the issues:

- [GRAMMAR]: Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "am the true expositors" should be "are").
- [SPELLING]: "settle" should be "settled."
- [SYNTAX]: Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "was supposed to had been settle" should be "had been settled").
- [LEXICON]: Use of archaic or formal language, but this is likely intentional for the context.
- [CLARITY]: Some sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability but not necessarily fluency.

Based on the evaluation criteria, the text has multiple grammatical and syntactic errors, but it's generally understandable. The errors are noticeable but don't severely disrupt comprehension. According to the scale, this would be a score of 3 or 3.5. However, the presence of multiple errors might push it to a 3.5. I need to check if the errors are frequent enough to lower the score. Since the text is long and has several issues, but still readable, 3.5 seems appropriate.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors: "am the true expositors," "the point was supposed to had been settle," "the real groundwork of that opinion am examined."  
- [SYNTAX] Incorrect verb forms: "was supposed to had been settle," "it would be found to consisted," "was loyal to the Church of England ought not to was satisfied."  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect past tense: "was not referred," "was not discussed," "was not now making."  
- [CLARITY] Awkward phrasing: "it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently hear," "we was taught by our Lord Himself," "the two acts are distinct, and the one must not was confounded."  
- [LEXICON] Non-standard word choice: "was not now making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected," "the Church had made herself responsible."  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
