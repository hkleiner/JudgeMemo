That's a total of 53 grammatical issues. There are also some other issues:

54) [SYNTAX] - Some sentences are awkwardly structured, making them harder to follow
55) [LEXICON] - Some word choices seem out of place or awkward for the context
56) [SYNTAX] - Some sentences have run-on phrases that could be better divided

Now, let me determine the fluency score based on the evaluation criteria:

The text has numerous grammatical errors that affect its fluency. There are multiple verb tense errors, subject-verb agreement issues, and awkward phrasing throughout. While the story is generally understandable, the frequent errors make the text less fluent and more difficult to read without effort.

Given the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal to no grammatical issues
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues
- Score 2: Contains frequent errors making comprehension difficult
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible

This text has many errors that interrupt the flow and make reading more effortful, but the overall meaning is still generally clear. I would place this at a Score 2.5, as the text contains frequent grammatical errors that make comprehension often difficult without effort, but it's not completely unintelligible.

Actually, let me reconsider. The text is a translation of a classic work with a humorous, satirical tone. Some of the grammatical errors might be intentional for comedic effect or to represent a particular voice (like the American Minister's character). However, many of the errors are likely unintentional. Given the number of issues, I would say this is a 2.5 on the fluency scale.
