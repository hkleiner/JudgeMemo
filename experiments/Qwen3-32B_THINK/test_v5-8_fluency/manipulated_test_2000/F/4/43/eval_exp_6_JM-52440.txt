Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. Let me start by understanding the criteria. Fluency here refers to grammatical correctness, non-repetitive phrasing, and adherence to common English usage with clear meaning. The scale is from 1 to 5, with 5 being highly fluent and 1 being largely unintelligible.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to identify any issues. The text is a religious discourse, so it's formal and uses archaic language, which might be intentional. However, fluency issues are about clarity and correctness, not style.

Looking at the first paragraph: "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion..." The use of "IT" with a capital letter is odd in a modern text. Maybe a typo? Also, the sentence structure is complex but grammatically correct. 

Next, "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence..." The phrase "at all an uncommon thing" is a bit awkward. It should be "not at all an uncommon thing" or "not at all uncommon." The repetition of "the" in "the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors..." could be simplified for clarity.

In the chapter on the Real Presence, there's a sentence that starts with "Two things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture..." The flow here is good. However, later on, there's a run-on sentence: "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This is incoherent and confusing. It seems like a sentence fragment or a mistake in punctuation, making it hard to understand. 

Another part: "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that." This is a jumbled sentence with no clear structure. It's a run-on and lacks proper punctuation, making it difficult to parse.

Similarly, the section on the Articles has a sentence: "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into." This is a complete mess. It's a run-on with no clear subject or verb, and the clauses don't connect logically. 

The text has several instances of run-on sentences and fragments, especially in the latter parts. These make the text hard to follow and disrupt the flow. There are also some grammatical errors, like missing articles or incorrect verb forms. For example, "the Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject..." The em dashes are used correctly, but the sentence structure is complex but not necessarily incorrect.

Repetition is another issue. Phrases like "the Church of England" are repeated frequently, which might be necessary for context but could be streamlined. However, repetition alone isn't a fluency issue unless it's excessive and distracts from the message.

In terms of clarity, some sentences are dense with religious terminology and complex ideas, which is expected in a theological text. However, when combined with poor punctuation and run-on sentences, it becomes difficult to follow the argument. For example, the sentence about the Articles and sacraments is long and has multiple clauses without proper commas, making it hard to parse.

Overall, the text is mostly grammatically correct where it's coherent, but the presence of run-on sentences, fragments, and jumbled phrases significantly impacts readability. The author's intent is to present a clear argument, but the fluency issues make it challenging for the reader to follow. The text is formal and uses archaic language, which might be stylistic but doesn't excuse the grammatical errors and structural problems.

Considering the scale, the text has multiple issues that interrupt the flow and clarity. However, there are sections where the writing is clear and fluent. The score would be around 3 because the text is generally readable but has enough issues to affect comprehension. The run-on sentences and incoherent parts drop it below a 4. A 2 would be if the text were mostly incomprehensible, but here, despite the problems, the main points are still discernible.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent run-on sentences with missing punctuation and unclear structure (e.g., "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith...")  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled phrases with non-parallel structure and missing subjects/verbs (e.g., "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer...")  
- [SPELLING] Repeated capitalization errors ("IT is a very easy thing...")  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence constructions that obscure meaning (e.g., "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose...")  
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur transitions between ideas without clear connectors  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
