Let me analyze this text for fluency issues and provide a rating on the 1-5 scale.

First, I'll identify fluency issues in the text:

1) [GRAMMAR] - The text contains numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb forms, and missing articles. For example: "have ventured to publish it" (should be "I have ventured..."), "he simply stated the principal facts" (should be "He simply stated..."), "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth" (should be "It should be destitute of monetary/mineral wealth").

2) [SPELLING] - There are multiple spelling errors throughout the text: "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "scientest" (should be "scientist"), "Jordon" (should be "Jordan"), "Bridtish" (should be "British"), "consitutes" (should be "constitutes"), "hightest" (should be "highest"), "jageed" (should be "jagged").

3) [SYNTAX] - The text has many run-on sentences and awkward sentence structures that make reading difficult. For example: "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The sentence structure is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

4) [PUNCTUATION] - There are issues with punctuation throughout the text. For example, missing commas in complex sentences, improper use of dashes and colons, and inconsistent punctuation at the end of sentences.

5) [REPETITION] - The text contains some repetitive phrasing and ideas. For example, the author repeatedly refers to "our garden" and "our Garden of Eden" in close proximity.

6) [CLARITY] - Some sentences are unclear or confusing in their meaning. For example: "And this hanging garden has been notable and notorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their Indian name 'rattlesnake hills,' and including Mount Trempealeau, (a separate and distinct pyramid) was formerly 'Literally alive with rattlesnakes.'"

7) [WORD CHOICE] - There are instances of awkward or inappropriate word choices. For example: "money mineral wealth" (should be "monetary/mineral wealth"), "hanging garden" (used in a way that might confuse with the famous ancient Hanging Gardens of Babylon).

8) [CONSISTENCY] - The author sometimes refers to "Eden" and "garden" in ways that are inconsistent or confusing in terms of what exactly is being referred to.

9) [SENTENCE FRAGMENTATION] - Some sentences appear to be fragments or incomplete thoughts. For example: "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." This seems out of context and disconnected from the surrounding text.

10) [LOGICAL FLOW] - While the text is attempting to make a coherent argument, the flow is often disrupted by these fluency issues and by the author's tendency to jump between different ideas.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency of this text as follows:

The text contains numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and syntactical issues that significantly impact readability. The author's argument is often obscured by these issues, and the text requires considerable effort to understand. While there are some clear and well-constructed sentences, the overall effect is of a text that is not fully polished and contains many distractions for the reader.

Given the evaluation scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

I believe the appropriate score for this text is a 2.5. The text is generally readable but contains frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make comprehension difficult in many places. The author's ideas are not entirely lost, but the fluency issues significantly impact the readability of the text.

Let me double-check my assessment:
- The text has frequent grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, missing articles, etc.)
- There are numerous spelling errors throughout
- The sentence structure is often awkward or run-on
- The author sometimes uses confusing or inappropriate word choices
- There are punctuation issues
- While some parts are clear, the overall effect is of a text that is not fully polished and requires effort to understand

Based on this assessment, a score of 2.5 seems appropriate - it's not so bad that the text is largely unintelligible (which would be a 1 or 2), but it contains enough issues that make reading and comprehension difficult in many places.
