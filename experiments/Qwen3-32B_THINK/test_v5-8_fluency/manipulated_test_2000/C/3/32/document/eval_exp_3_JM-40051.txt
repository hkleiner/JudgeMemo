Let me analyze the text for fluency issues and then determine a score based on the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll identify fluency issues in the text:

1) [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, such as missing articles (e.g., "the thing" instead of "the thing"), incorrect subject-verb agreement, and improper use of tenses.

2) [SPELLING] There are several spelling mistakes, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," "antideluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "euphony" instead of "euphony," "euphonious" instead of "euphonious," and "jageed" instead of "jagged."

3) [SYNTAX] The text contains many run-on sentences and sentences with poor structure that make comprehension difficult. For example, the sentence beginning "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth..." is extremely long and complex, making it hard to follow.

4) [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic or obscure vocabulary in a confusing way, and at times the word choice doesn't match the intended meaning.

5) [PUNCTUATION] There are numerous punctuation errors, including missing commas, incorrect use of dashes and hyphens, and improper capitalization.

6) [COHESION] The text jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's line of reasoning.

7) [REPETITION] There is excessive repetition of phrases and concepts, particularly around the "garden of Eden" and "Mississippi River" themes.

8) [STYLE] The writing style is overly verbose and contains many awkward phrases that make the text feel forced rather than natural.

9) [INCONSISTENT CAPITALIZATION] The text inconsistently capitalizes words, including some nouns that should not be capitalized and failing to capitalize proper nouns consistently.

Now I'll determine a fluency score based on the evaluation criteria:

The text has numerous fluency issues that significantly impact readability. The grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, poor syntax, and punctuation problems are frequent and often interfere with comprehension. While the text is generally readable and the author's ideas can be discerned, the frequent errors and awkward phrasing make it difficult to follow the argument and understand the content without effort.

Based on the scale:
- A score of 5 would be for "Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues."
- A score of 4 would be for "Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing."
- A score of 3 would be for "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways."
- A score of 2 would be for "Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort."
- A score of 1 would be for "Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand."

Given the frequency and severity of the issues, I would give this text a score of 2.5. The text is generally readable and the author's ideas can be understood, but the frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure make comprehension difficult at times and require effort to follow the author's argument.

Actually, let me reconsider my assessment based on the scale description more carefully:

The text is definitely not a 5 or even a 4. The frequent errors and awkward phrasing do disrupt reading and understanding.

It's also not a 2. While the text has many issues, it is generally readable and the author's ideas are mostly clear, even if they require some effort to follow.

Based on the description for a score of 3: "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways," this seems to be the most accurate description of this text. The text is generally readable and the author's ideas are mostly clear, but the multiple grammatical and structural issues do interrupt the flow and clarity in noticeable ways.

Therefore, I'll revise my score to 3 for fluency.
