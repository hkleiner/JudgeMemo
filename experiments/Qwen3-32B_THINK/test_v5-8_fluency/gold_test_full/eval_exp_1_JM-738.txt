Let me evaluate the text for fluency based on the given criteria. I'll identify any issues with grammar, repetition, structure, and English usage, then provide a final score on the 1-5 scale.

Looking at the text, it's a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang. The text is quite long and detailed, and it appears to be written in a formal academic style.

Fluency Issues:

[GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues, though they are relatively minor. For example, the text occasionally uses passive voice in a way that might be more clearly expressed in active voice. There are also some sentence fragments that could be combined for better flow.

[SYNTAX] The syntax is generally complex, as expected in an academic text, but there are a few places where the sentence structure could be clearer. For instance, some sentences are quite long and could benefit from being broken up for better readability.

[LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for an academic text on literature, but there are some places where word choice could be more precise. For example, the text uses some archaic or old-fashioned expressions that might be less familiar to modern readers.

[COHERENCE] The text is generally coherent and well-structured, with clear logical progression from one point to the next. The author presents his analysis in a logical sequence, discussing different theories and interpretations of the novel.

[STYLE] There are some stylistic choices that might be considered less fluent, such as the use of footnotes or parenthetical expressions that disrupt the flow of the text.

[REPETITION] There are a few instances of repetition, particularly in the way the author refers to different theories and interpretations. This repetition doesn't significantly impact readability but could be reduced.

[CLARITY] The text is generally clear in its meaning, though there are some complex ideas that might be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the novel or literary analysis.

[TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth, but there are a few places where the connections between ideas could be clearer.

Overall assessment:
The text is well-written and largely fluent, with clear meaning and logical structure. The author presents complex ideas in a coherent manner. The text is written in a formal academic style with appropriate vocabulary for the subject matter. While there are a few minor issues with grammar, syntax, and style, these do not significantly impact the overall readability.

Based on the evaluation criteria, I would rate this text as a 4.5. It's mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't disrupt the overall readability. The complex academic style is appropriate for the subject matter, and the author effectively communicates his analysis of the novel.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues appear in some complex constructions, such as "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow" (awkward phrasing).  
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses could be more concise, e.g., "We now come to the evidence which Forster strangely overlooked, which Mr. Proctor and Mr. Archer correctly deciphered, and which Mr. Cuming Walters misinterprets" (cumbersome structure).  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal word choices (e.g., "thenceforth," "thereunto") may feel dated to modern readers.  
- [STYLE] The academic tone is consistent but occasionally overly verbose, e.g., "We do not know, as Mr. Proctor insists, what Mr. Grewgious had been doing at Cloisterham between Christmas Day and December 27, the date of his experiment on Jasper’s nerves" (could be simplified).  
- [REPETITION] Slight repetition of phrases like "Dickens’s novel" or "Jasper’s character" appears in different sections.  
- [CLARITY] A few abstract or metaphorical phrases (e.g., "the bloom is off the plum of their prearranged loves") may require rereading for clarity.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
