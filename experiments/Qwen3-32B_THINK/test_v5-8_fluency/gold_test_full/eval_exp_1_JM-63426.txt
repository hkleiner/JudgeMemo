Alright, let's take a look at this text. It's a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. The text is quite long, with multiple chapters and a chronology at the end. I need to evaluate it for fluency according to the given criteria.

First, I'll scan through the text to identify any issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexis. The text appears to be in past tense throughout, which is consistent. However, I notice some shifts in tense and perspective in the final chapters. For example, in the "TODAY IN 1954" chapter, it shifts to present tense when discussing current conditions. This is a bit jarring but might be intentional for contrast.

Looking at grammar, I don't see any major errors. The sentences are generally well-structured. However, there are some instances of awkward phrasing or word choice. For example, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." This is a metaphor that might be confusing to some readers, but it's not a grammatical error.

There are some complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors." These sentences are long but still clear and grammatically correct.

I notice some repetition in the text, such as the repeated use of "caslon" and "typography." This is likely due to the subject matter, not a flaw in fluency.

There are some instances where the text uses archaic or less common phrasing, such as "You are six years old; next month you will be seven." This is consistent with the narrative style and not a fluency issue.

I also see some inconsistent capitalization, such as "Daily Item" and "Daily Item." This is a minor issue but could be considered a formatting inconsistency.

Overall, the text is well-written with minimal grammatical errors. The phrasing is generally clear and natural, though there are a few instances of awkward or complex sentences. The text is readable and maintains a consistent narrative voice throughout.

Based on the evaluation criteria, this text would likely score a 4.5 or 5. It's highly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability. The text is well-structured and uses clear, natural phrasing. The few awkward or complex sentences don't distract from the overall reading experience.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Some complex sentences with multiple clauses that could be simplified for better readability (e.g., "It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors").  
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or overly formal phrasing (e.g., "You are six years old; next month you will be seven").  
- [TENSE] Sudden shifts in tense and perspective in the final chapters (e.g., present tense in "TODAY IN 1954" section).  
- [STYLE] Minor repetition of terms like "Caslon" and "typography" due to subject matter.  
- [FORMAT] Inconsistent capitalization in proper nouns (e.g., "Daily Item" vs. "Daily Item").  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
