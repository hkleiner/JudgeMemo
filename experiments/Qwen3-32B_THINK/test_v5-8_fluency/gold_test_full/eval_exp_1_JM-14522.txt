Let me analyze the text for fluency issues according to the evaluation criteria. The text is a chapter excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde.

First, I'll look for any grammatical issues, non-repetitive phrasing, and whether the English usage is natural with clear meaning.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are a few minor grammatical issues, but nothing major that would significantly disrupt reading. For example, "There had been a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir Simon's tombstone" is a bit awkwardly worded but still clear.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are complex and could be simplified, but they generally maintain clarity. The narrative style is appropriate for a literary work and doesn't significantly hinder comprehension.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for a literary work of this type. Some archaic or formal language is used ("ye", "thou", etc.) which is consistent with the setting and characters.
- [REPETITION] There is some repetition of phrases like "ghost" and "Canterville" that could be reduced for better flow, but this is somewhat expected in a narrative about a ghost haunting a specific location.
- [STYLE] The writing style is consistent with 19th-century literary English, with some archaic expressions that might seem unusual to modern readers but are appropriate for the context.

Looking at the text as a whole, I don't see any major fluency issues that would significantly disrupt reading or understanding. The text is well-written and maintains a consistent style throughout. There are some complex sentences and archaic language, but these are appropriate for the genre and do not detract from the overall fluency.

Based on the evaluation criteria, this text would likely score a 5 for fluency. It is highly fluent with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. The archaic language and complex sentences are appropriate for the literary style and do not distract from reading or understanding.

However, I'll be slightly more conservative and give it a 4.5 since some of the archaic expressions and complex sentence structures might be slightly less natural to modern readers, though they are appropriate for the literary context.

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [STYLE] The text uses archaic expressions and formal language ("ye", "thou", "twilight" instead of "evening") that might seem unusual to modern readers but are appropriate for the 19th-century literary context.
- [COMPLEXITY] Some sentences are complex and lengthy, particularly in the descriptive passages, but they maintain clarity and are appropriate for the literary style.
- [REPETITION] There is some repetition of key terms like "ghost" and "Canterville" that could be reduced for better flow, but this is somewhat expected in a narrative about a ghost haunting a specific location.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for a literary work of this type, with some archaic or formal language that is consistent with the setting and characters.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
