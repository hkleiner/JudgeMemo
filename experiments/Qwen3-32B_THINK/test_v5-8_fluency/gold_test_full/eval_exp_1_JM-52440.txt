Let me analyze the text for fluency issues according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with clarity and common English usage.

The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite long and dense, but I need to focus on fluency rather than content.

Looking at the text:

1) The text is generally well-written and follows standard English grammar rules.
2) The sentence structure is complex but coherent, appropriate for a scholarly work.
3) The vocabulary is advanced but used correctly.
4) There are some instances of archaic or formal language (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing", "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him"), but these are stylistic choices rather than errors.
5) The text maintains a consistent voice and tone throughout.
6) There are some complex sentences that could be simplified, but they don't hinder understanding.
7) The text contains some theological jargon, but it's used appropriately within the context.

Specific fluency issues I notice:

- [STYLE] The text uses archaic capitalization (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing") that is inconsistent with modern English usage.
- [STYLE] The text has a very formal, archaic style with phrases like "I am not now discussing" and "I am not about to discuss" that sound old-fashioned.
- [STYLE] The text uses some outdated expressions like "I am not about to discuss" and "I am not now discussing" which are somewhat awkward in modern English.
- [STYLE] The text has a very dense, academic style that may be difficult for some readers, but this is not a fluency issue per se, just a stylistic choice.
- [STYLE] The text has some repetitive phrasing, particularly in the first chapter where it repeats the idea that "the Church of England denies" certain doctrines.
- [STYLE] The text has some complex sentence structures that could be simplified for better readability, but they don't impede understanding.
- [STYLE] The text uses some rhetorical questions and exclamations that add to the persuasive tone but don't affect fluency.

Overall, the text is highly fluent with only minor issues related to style and archaic language. The core of the evaluation criteria (grammatical correctness, clarity, and natural phrasing) is well-maintained throughout.

Based on the evaluation criteria:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
- Score 3: Generally readable but contains multiple issues that interrupt the flow.
- Score 2: Contains frequent errors making comprehension difficult.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible.

This text would receive a score of 4.5. It's mostly fluent with clear, natural phrasing, but the archaic style and some complex sentence structures represent minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

Let me refine my assessment to make sure I'm accurate:

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [STYLE] The text uses archaic capitalization (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing") that is inconsistent with modern English usage.

- [STYLE] The text has some complex sentence structures that could be simplified for better readability, but they don't impede understanding.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
