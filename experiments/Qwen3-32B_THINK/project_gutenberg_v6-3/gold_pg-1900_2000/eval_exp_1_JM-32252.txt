Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] - "But, on the one hand, I am convinced that every effort at synthesis, however premature it may seem, cannot fail to react usefully on investigations, provided one offers it in all frankness for what it is." - This sentence is grammatically correct but has complex structure that may be confusing.

2. [SYNTAX] - "Various objections which have been expressed to me, as well as my own subsequent reflections, have caused me to revise and complete on certain points my London address." - The phrase "complete on certain points" is awkwardly placed.

3. [LEXICON] - "In the essential features, however, nothing has been changed." - "complete on certain points" is awkward phrasing.

4. [SYNTAX] - "I shall not enter into the question of the formation of capital itself, that is, of the sum total of the goods employed by their possessor to produce more goods at a profit." - The phrase "the sum total of the goods employed by their possessor" is awkward.

5. [SYNTAX] - "It is the capitalist alone, the holder of capital, who will hold our attention." - The phrase "the holder of capital" is awkwardly placed.

6. [SYNTAX] - "I have observed, in surveying this history from the beginning of the Middle Ages to our own times, a very interesting phenomenon to which, so it seems to me, attention has not yet been sufficiently called." - This sentence is overly long and complex.

7. [SYNTAX] - "In their place arise new men, courageous and enterprising, who boldly permit themselves to be driven by the wind actually blowing and who know how to trim their sails to take advantage of it, until the day comes when, its direction changing and disconcerting their manoeuvres, they in their turn pause and are distanced by new craft having fresh forces and new directions." - This sentence is very long and complex.

8. [LEXICON] - "It is as if the capitalists who have up to that time been active, recognize that they are incapable of adapting, themselves to conditions which are evoked by needs hitherto unknown and which call for methods hitherto unemployed." - The phrase "adapt, themselves" has a comma splice.

9. [SYNTAX] - "But the spirit which inspired him may have inspired a goodly number of negociatores who launched their barks on the streams of the ninth century." - The phrase "a goodly number" is somewhat archaic and unusual.

10. [SYNTAX] - "But the spirit which inspired him may have inspired a goodly number of negociatores who launched their barks on the streams of the ninth century." - The sentence structure is complex and the word "negociatores" is archaic.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] - The text begins with a hypothesis and then dives into detailed analysis without clearly establishing the structure or roadmap for the argument.

2. [STRUCTURE] - The text has long, complex paragraphs with multiple ideas that could benefit from clearer organization.

3. [LOGIC] - The argument about capitalism in the Middle Ages is complex and could be clearer in its logical progression.

4. [CLARITY] - Some concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation for a general reader (e.g., "BÃ¼cher's brilliant Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft").

5. [LOGIC] - The text shifts between discussing medieval capitalism and modern capitalism without always making the connections clear.

6. [STRUCTURE] - The text moves from one historical period to another without always providing clear transitions.

7. [CLARITY] - The metaphor of capitalism as a "staircase" is introduced but not fully explained or elaborated.

8. [LOGIC] - The argument about different "classes of capitalists" for each economic period is introduced but not clearly defined or supported in the early part of the text.

9. [LOGIC] - The text discusses "anticapitalistic" organization but doesn't clearly define what this means in contrast to "capitalistic" or "acapitalistic" organization.

10. [LOGIC] - The text makes claims about the economic activities of medieval merchants but doesn't always clearly connect these to the overall thesis about capitalism.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations.

**Fluency Score:**
The text is generally well-written and readable, but it has several instances of complex sentence structures, awkward phrasing, and some archaic language. These issues can make the text more difficult to follow at times, but they don't significantly hinder understanding. I would rate this as a 4 - mostly fluent with some minor issues.

**Coherence Score:**
The text presents a complex argument about the history of capitalism. While the author has a clear thesis, the logical progression of ideas is sometimes obscured by the complex structure and dense writing. The connections between different historical periods and concepts could be clearer. I would rate this as a 3.5 - generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions at times.

Now I'll format my response according to the requested format.
