Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll examine the text for fluency issues:

1. Grammar: 
- The text uses "warn't" instead of "wasn't" in several places (e.g., "there warn’t any of them going my way")
- The text uses "ain't" in several places (e.g., "The under clerk answered up prompt and says—'There ain’t any such orb.'")

2. Spelling:
- The text has archaic or dialectal spellings like "laid" (past tense of "lie") instead of "lay"
- "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" has a spelling issue with "clothe" when it should be "clothe" (though it might be archaic usage)
- "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" has a strange capitalization of "clothe"

3. Syntax:
- The text has long, complex sentences with many subordinate clauses
- Some sentences have non-standard syntax that may be confusing to modern readers
- The dialogue format with "says I" and "says he" is archaic and may be confusing

4. Punctuation:
- The text has inconsistent punctuation in dialogue (some quotes end with em dashes, others with regular punctuation)
- The text has some missing commas in complex sentences
- The text has inconsistent capitalization in some places

Now, for coherence issues:

1. Logical progression:
- The text is a narrative that follows a logical progression of events
- The story moves through space, describes encounters with comets, and then arrives at the gates of heaven
- The sequence of events makes sense within the context of the story

2. Organization:
- The text is well-organized, with a clear beginning, middle, and end
- The narrative flows in a logical sequence
- The text uses a consistent point of view (first-person narrative)

3. Transitions:
- The text has some abrupt transitions between scenes
- Some paragraphs jump from one idea to another without clear transitions
- The shift from describing the comet race to the narrator arriving at heaven is abrupt

4. Consistency:
- The text maintains a consistent voice and perspective throughout
- The narrative remains focused on the main story
- The text maintains a consistent level of formality and style

Based on my analysis:

For Fluency:
The text has several archaic or dialectal language features that may be considered errors by modern standards, including non-standard spellings (warn't instead of wasn't, ain't), archaic verb forms (laid instead of lay), and non-standard syntax. There are also some punctuation issues and inconsistent capitalization. However, these are likely intentional stylistic choices to reflect the narrator's voice and the story's setting. Given these considerations, I would rate the fluency as a 4. The text is mostly fluent and well-structured, though it contains some minor issues in grammar or phrasing that are noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.

For Coherence:
The text is generally coherent with a clear narrative progression. The story moves logically from the narrator's journey through space to his arrival at heaven. There are some abrupt transitions between scenes and occasional jumps in the narrative, but these do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text. I would rate the coherence as a 4.5. The text is mostly coherent with only a few weak or slightly disconnected parts that do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.

Let me refine my assessment:

Fluency: 4. The text has some archaic or dialectal language features that could be considered errors by modern standards, but they seem to be intentional stylistic choices. The text is mostly fluent and well-structured.

Coherence: 4.5. The text is mostly coherent with a clear narrative progression, though there are a few abrupt transitions and occasional jumps in the narrative that don't significantly disrupt the flow.

I'll now format my response according to the requested format.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Use of archaic dialectal forms (warn't, ain't, laid) - [SYNTAX] Overly complex and archaic sentence structures - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent punctuation in dialogue - [SPELLING] Unconventional capitalization in "clothe her from stem to rudder-post"

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from space journey to arrival at heaven - [STRUCTURE] Sudden transition from comet race to gate scene - [LOGIC] Slightly disjointed dialogue with heaven's gatekeeper

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
