Alright, let's evaluate the text according to the given criteria.

## FLUENCY

First, I'll look for fluency issues in the text. Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues I notice:
- [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent punctuation, particularly in dialogue where quotation marks are used inconsistently (sometimes with a period, sometimes without).
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas in dialogue, making the flow awkward.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences end with a comma instead of a period.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences use an em dash instead of a proper punctuation mark.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are inconsistent uses of hyphens and dashes, especially in compound adjectives.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have missing periods at the end.
- [PUNCTUATION] The text uses both British and American quotation marks inconsistently.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas in compound sentences.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have inconsistent capitalization after periods.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing quotation marks for dialogue.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent but has several punctuation issues that affect readability. I would rate fluency as a 4.

## COHERENCE

Now I'll assess the coherence of the text. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds as a whole, with logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections between ideas, and clear progression from one section to another.

Issues I notice:
- [LOGIC] The story jumps between different time periods without clear transitions (past and present).
- [LOGIC] Some narrative elements are introduced suddenly without sufficient setup or explanation.
- [LOGIC] The story contains some disjointed elements that don't always flow logically from one to the next.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes shifts abruptly from one character's perspective to another.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without connecting to the previous content.
- [LOGIC] The story occasionally moves from emotional moments to more mundane details without a smooth transition.
- [LOGIC] Some of the more philosophical reflections on war and its impact on soldiers and society seem somewhat disconnected from the main narrative.

However, the story does maintain a clear central narrative about the wedding of Marjorie and Leonard, and the emotional arc is generally coherent. The text does provide a logical progression from their meeting, to Leonard's departure for war, to his return and their wedding.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent but has some logical jumps and disconnections. I would rate coherence as a 4.

Let me finalize my ratings:

Fluency: 4 - The text is mostly fluent with some punctuation issues that affect readability but don't significantly disrupt comprehension.

Coherence: 4 - The text is mostly coherent with a clear central narrative, but has some logical jumps and disconnections that could be improved.
