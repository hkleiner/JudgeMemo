Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, fluency. I need to look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text seems to be well-written overall. The sentences flow smoothly, and there are no obvious spelling mistakes. The word choice is appropriate, and the punctuation is correctly used. However, there are a few instances where the phrasing might be a bit awkward or where the sentence structure could be clearer. For example, in the sentence "Mr. Arthur Davis, in whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures devoted to the fostering of Hebraic thought and learning," the structure is a bit wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. Also, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability slightly. But these are minor issues and don't distract much from the overall fluency. I'd say the fluency is mostly fluent with minor issues, so a score of 4.

Next, coherence. The text is a book foreword and first two chapters discussing the life of Arthur Davis and the concept of the Jewish Chosen People. The structure is logical, moving from Davis's contributions to the broader discussion of chosen people. The ideas are connected smoothly, and there's a clear progression. However, there are a few places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, when moving from discussing Arthur Davis to the broader topic of Hebrew as a ritual language, the connection isn't as explicit as it could be. Also, in Chapter II, when the author starts discussing the interpretation of biblical passages, the shift from the historical examples to the philosophical argument is a bit abrupt. These are minor issues, but they do slightly affect the coherence. Still, the overall structure is logical and the ideas are well-organized. So, coherence would be mostly coherent with a few weak parts, leading to a score of 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "in whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures")
- [STYLE] Overly formal and archaic language choices ("evolved a doctrine of special election," "by argosy and caravan")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences (e.g., "The proposition contains just that dash of truth which is more dangerous than falsehood undiluted")
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization of "Hebrew" and "Jewish" in some contexts

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between historical examples and philosophical arguments without clear transitions
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Arthur Davis's biography to broader theological discussions
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "he" and "they" in multi-paragraph sections
- [COHESION] Disconnected ideas between the two chapters (foreword and main text)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
