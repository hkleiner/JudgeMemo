Alright, I'll evaluate the provided text according to the fluency and coherence criteria on a scale from 1 to 5.

Let me first understand the text and identify potential issues:

**Fluency Issues** (syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):
1. [SYNTAX] "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." - This sentence has an awkward structure that could be clearer.
2. [GRAMMAR] "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body, and it thrilled him to speak to thousands, even millions, instead of just scores." - The phrase "it thrilled him to speak to thousands" is slightly awkward.
3. [SYNTAX] "So he spread his work over magazines, newspapers, the advertising of such houses as the Strathmore Paper Company, his own lively but not limited publications, even the movies." - This sentence is long and could be clearer with better punctuation.
4. [LEXICON] "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." - "Corn-fed" is an unusual phrase choice here that might confuse readers.
5. [SYNTAX] "So he enormously enriched our arts; and he smashed more false fronts and took more liberties--successfully--than anyone has done before or since." - The semicolon and em dashes create an awkward flow.
6. [GRAMMAR] "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item." - The em dash here is appropriate, but the sentence could be clearer.
7. [GRAMMAR] "When the Iron Ore job printer leaves you are sorry." - This sentence has a missing subject-verb agreement.
8. [SYNTAX] "You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press. Then you receive your first lesson in feeding." - These sentences are short and choppy, creating an awkward rhythm.
9. [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" - This sentence appears to be a leftover instruction that doesn't belong in the text.
10. [SPELLING] "You are now on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston." - The quotation marks are unusual and not standard.
11. [SYNTAX] "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." - The phrase "anyway" is awkward here.
12. [GRAMMAR] "Your mother is troubled. Finally she says, “Perhaps it will be for the best.”" - The transition between sentences is slightly awkward.
13. [SYNTAX] "You go to the office of the Iron Agitator, that later became Iron Ore." - The phrase "that later became" should be "which later became."
14. [GRAMMAR] "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings." - The sentence structure is a bit awkward.
15. [SYNTAX] "It is nearly nine o’clock on a Friday night--“make-up” time." - The em dash placement is awkward.
16. [SYNTAX] "He is a fine man and you like him and he likes you--but of course you can’t expect him to pay for your art education." - The sentence is a bit long and could be clearer.

**Coherence Issues** (logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities, and consistent structure):
1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions (e.g., from Boston to Michigan to Ishpeming).
2. [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes moves abruptly from one concept to another without clear connections (e.g., from discussing European art movements to Will Bradley's impact in America).
3. [TRANSITION] There are several abrupt transitions between paragraphs that could benefit from smoother connections (e.g., from the introduction to the boy printer story).
4. [CLARITY] Some passages are vague or ambiguous (e.g., "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too").
5. [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes presents information in a non-linear fashion that could confuse readers (e.g., discussing Will Bradley's later career before his early life).
6. [COHESION] The text sometimes shifts between different narrative voices (e.g., from the introduction's more formal tone to the second-person narrative in the second chapter).
7. [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be two distinct chapters with different narrative styles that aren't clearly introduced or separated.
8. [LOGIC] Some cause-effect relationships are presented without clear explanations (e.g., how Will Bradley's work impacted American graphic arts).
9. [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the second chapter is abrupt and could benefit from a smoother connection.

Now I'll rate the text based on these observations:

For **Fluency**, I would give a 3.5. The text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways. There are several awkward phrasings, some grammatical issues, and a few confusing word choices that affect readability.

For **Coherence**, I would give a 3. The text is generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience. The narrative sometimes jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions, and the text shifts between different narrative voices.

Let me review my assessment one more time to ensure accuracy:

**Fluency** - I identified 16 specific issues related to syntax, grammar, and phrasing that affect the smoothness of the text. While the text is generally understandable, these issues do interrupt the flow and clarity in noticeable ways.

**Coherence** - I identified 9 specific issues related to structure, logic, and transitions that affect the overall coherence of the text. The narrative sometimes jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions, and the text shifts between different narrative styles.

I believe my ratings of 3.5 for fluency and 3 for coherence are appropriate based on the evaluation criteria.
