Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria and scales. Let's start with fluency. The text is a philosophical essay discussing Spencer's philosophy, quoting passages, and analyzing concepts. 

First, I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The text is quite dense and uses complex vocabulary. I notice a few places where the sentence structure might be a bit convoluted. For example, in the sentence "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave." The phrasing here is a bit unclear. The transition from breaking free to becoming a slave seems abrupt and the sentence structure is confusing.

Another example is the sentence: "I dimly suspected that the old gentleman--old in the sense of being my father's contemporary--was ignorant of those recent developments of modern science with which I had been acquainted for weeks, nay more for months." The use of "nay more" is archaic and might be confusing to some readers. Also, the sentence is quite long and could be split for clarity.

Looking for spelling errors, I don't see any obvious ones. The text uses proper nouns like "Tyndall" and "Spencer" correctly. The syntax is generally correct, but there are a few instances where the flow is disrupted by complex sentences that might be hard to follow. For example, the paragraph starting with "If then differentiation be the cardinal law of evolution..." is a long sentence with multiple clauses that might make it harder to read.

Now, moving to coherence. The text discusses Spencer's philosophy, quoting passages and analyzing them. The overall structure is logical, moving from an introduction to Spencer's ideas, through various aspects of his philosophy, and concluding with the impact of his work. However, there are a few points where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For instance, the shift from discussing the nebular hypothesis to the article in the Westminster Review is a bit abrupt. The connection between the friend's comment and the subsequent discussion isn't clearly explained.

Another coherence issue is the sudden shift in the last paragraph to a summary of Spencer's contributions without clear transitions. The text moves from discussing the philosophy of life and mind to the mechanical foundations and then to the summary of Spencer's creed. The flow between these sections isn't always smooth, which might confuse readers.

There are also some instances where the text introduces complex ideas without sufficient context. For example, the discussion of "subject and object" and "the Unknowable" might be confusing without prior knowledge of Spencer's philosophy. The text assumes the reader is familiar with these concepts, which could affect coherence for some readers.

Considering the coherence scale, the text is mostly coherent with a clear progression of ideas, but there are some weak transitions and confusing segments. The fluency issues are minor, mostly involving complex sentence structures and archaic language, which are present but don't significantly disrupt readability. 

Based on the fluency scale, I would rate it a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with some minor issues in phrasing and sentence structure that don't hinder understanding. For coherence, I would also give a 4.5. The overall structure is logical, but there are a few abrupt transitions and complex ideas that might need more explanation.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Believing that I was independently breaking free...")  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure terms (e.g., "nay more," "Sartor Resartus")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly long sentences disrupting readability (e.g., "I dimly suspected...")  
- [STRUCTURE] Awkward phrasing in transitions between ideas (e.g., "Thus we are led up to the statement...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between topics (e.g., from nebular hypothesis to Westminster Review article)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt connections between paragraphs (e.g., moving from "Unknowable" to Spencer's creed)  
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of Spencerian concepts without sufficient explanation (e.g., "subject and object")  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow in final sections (e.g., abrupt shift to summarizing contributions)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
