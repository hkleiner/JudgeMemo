Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Analysis

I need to look for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice a few issues:

1. Missing words: "Gen." is used as an abbreviation for "General" but then the text continues with "Robert E. Leeâ€™s Army of Northern Virginia" without completing the sentence.
2. Inconsistent capitalization: The section headings like "Union Movements" and "Confederate Movements" are capitalized in a way that doesn't match standard title case.
3. Some awkward phrasing: "The failure of Union forces to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia was a source of growing concern in Washington."
4. Some run-on sentences or overly long sentences that could be split for better readability.

However, overall the text is quite fluent, with clear natural phrasing and minimal grammatical issues.

# Coherence Analysis

I need to look for logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, and how consistent and clear the narrative is.

Looking at the text:

1. The text is well-structured with clear chapters and sections.
2. The narrative flows logically from the background of the Civil War to the specific campaign for Petersburg.
3. The text provides clear explanations of military strategies and movements.
4. The information is presented in a chronological manner that makes sense.
5. The text maintains a consistent focus on the campaign for Petersburg throughout.

There are some minor issues:
1. The brief section with "Union Movements", "Confederate Movements", and "Major Battles and Engagements" is a bit abrupt and doesn't flow as smoothly with the rest of the text.
2. The text jumps from discussing the overall situation to listing specific movements and battles, which could be better connected.

Overall, the text is highly coherent with a clear and logical progression throughout.

Based on my analysis:
- Fluency: The text has minimal issues with grammar, syntax, and phrasing. I would rate it a 4.5.
- Coherence: The text is well-structured with a clear logical progression. I would rate it a 5.

Now I'll format my response according to the requested format.
