Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user provided a long historical narrative about Canterbury. First, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice some commas are missing or misplaced. For example, in the sentence "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons was sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., 'To thee, Thomas Becket, some time Archbishop of Canterbury'--who had then been dead for 368 years--'to appear within thirty days to answer to a charge of treason, contumacy, and rebellion against his sovereign lord, King Henry II.'" The commas after "Henry VIII." and before the closing quotation might be missing, making the sentence a bit confusing. Also, the em dashes and quotation marks are used but not consistently. 

There are some awkward phrasings. For example, "the venerated bones of the wonder-working saint" could be more smoothly phrased. The phrase "the remains were not burned, but throughout the land every statue, wall-painting, and window to the said Thomas Becket was rigorously searched out and destroyed" uses "was" instead of "were" since the subject is plural, which is a grammar issue.

Another example is "who had then been dead for 368 years" â€“ the placement of "then" might be a bit awkward. Also, the sentence structure in some parts is complex and might be hard to follow, like "Further than this went the sentence, for Thomas of Canterbury was to be a saint no longer..." which is a bit wordy and could be rephrased for clarity.

Spelling seems okay, but I noticed "cosmopolitan groups of travel-soiled men and women who for century after century feasted their eyes from the selfsame spot." The word "century" is repeated, which is a minor issue but might be a typo if it's supposed to be "centuries."

Moving to coherence, the text is a historical narrative, so the flow of ideas should be logical. The transition between the 16th-century events and the discussion about modern pilgrims is a bit abrupt. The author mentions the 1538 events and then jumps to a century ago, which might confuse the reader about the time frame.

In the second chapter, the transition from the Roman period to the Saxon invasions is handled, but there's a sudden shift from discussing the Romans to the Jutes taking over, which could be clearer. Also, the mention of Ethelbert and the timeline might be a bit confusing. The text introduces several historical figures and events, but the connections between them aren't always explicit, which could make the narrative feel disjointed.

There's a part where the author discusses the church of St. Martin and the debate among archaeologists. The flow here is logical, but the conclusion about St. Martin's being a Saxon building with Roman materials is a bit abrupt after discussing the different viewpoints. The reader might need more context to understand why the conclusion is drawn that way.

Overall, the text is well-structured, but some transitions and connections between historical periods could be smoother. The coherence is generally good, but there are a few spots where the narrative jumps or the logical flow isn't as clear as it could be.

For fluency, the issues are mostly minor: some grammar errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues. These don't severely impact readability but are noticeable. For coherence, the structure is mostly logical, but some transitions and connections between ideas could be improved. The score for fluency would be around 4 because the text is mostly fluent with minor issues. Coherence might be a 4 as well, with a few weak transitions but overall good structure.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "every statue, wall-painting, and window to the said Thomas Becket was rigorously searched out" (subject-verb agreement error).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Further than this went the sentence, for Thomas of Canterbury was to be a saint no longer..." (inverted structure disrupts flow).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misplaced commas and inconsistent quotation/em dash usage (e.g., "Henry VIII., 'To thee...'--who...--'to appear...'").  
- [LEXICON] Redundant phrasing in "the most convenient, rapid, and comfortable method of travel then available" (repetition of adjectives).  
- [SPELLING] Minor typo: "century after century" instead of "centuries after centuries" (contextually acceptable but slightly jarring).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from 1538 events to a "century ago" discussion without clear temporal linkage.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from Roman history to Saxon invasions in Chapter II without bridging context.  
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear connection between the debate over St. Martin's origins and the narrative's main focus on Canterbury's history.  
- [CLARITY] Confusing timeline in Ethelbert's reign and the Christianization process (e.g., "nearly nine centuries to make up its mind" implies a timeline that lacks explicit explanation).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
