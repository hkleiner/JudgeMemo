Alright, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully to understand what I'm evaluating. The text is an excerpt from "The Feast of St. Friend," which seems to be a reflective piece on the changing nature of Christmas over time. It's divided into two chapters, "The Fact" and "The Reason," each exploring different aspects of how the author perceives the loss of Christmas's original spirit.

Now, I need to evaluate this text on two main criteria: fluency and coherence, using the Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. Let me start with fluency.

**Fluency Evaluation:**
The fluency of a text refers to how smoothly and clearly it reads, including grammar, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I'll look for any issues that might disrupt the flow or make the text harder to read.

- [SYNTAX] "Something has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both." The repetition of "or to" is slightly redundant and could be simplified for better flow.
- [GRAMMAR] "The tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap." The phrase "the cord snapping" is metaphorical, but the use of "cord" might be unclear without context.
- [LEXICON] "We did salute the happy morn." The use of "morn" is archaic and might be less clear to modern readers, but it's stylistic and not an error.
- [SPELLING] I don't see any spelling errors in the text.
- [PUNCTUATION] The text generally uses appropriate punctuation, but there are a few instances where commas or periods might be missing or misplaced. For example, "And we ate, and we drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition..." The repetition of "and" is stylistic, but the semicolon might be better replaced with a comma or a period for clarity.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent. The author uses a formal, somewhat archaic style that might be challenging for some readers, but the issues I've noted are minor and don't significantly hinder understanding. I would rate fluency as a 4, as there are a few minor grammatical and syntactical issues but nothing that disrupts the overall readability.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are connected and how logically the text progresses. I'll look for abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.

- [LOGIC] The text transitions from describing the past Christmas to the present, then to the reasons for the change. The flow is logical, but the shift from personal reflection to philosophical discussion might feel abrupt to some readers.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is structured into two chapters, each with a clear theme. However, the transition between "The Fact" and "The Reason" could be smoother. The reader might expect a clearer link between the two chapters.
- [CLARITY] The author's argument is generally clear, but some of the philosophical points, especially regarding the impact of science and philosophy on the Christmas spirit, might be dense or require additional context for full understanding.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth, but there are a few instances where the connection between ideas is not immediately clear. For example, the shift from discussing the children's role in maintaining Christmas traditions to the impact of philosophers and scientists is somewhat abrupt.
- [COHESION] The text maintains a cohesive theme throughout, focusing on the loss of the Christmas spirit and the reasons behind it. The author revisits and reinforces the central idea in different ways, which helps maintain coherence.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent. The structure is logical, and the themes are well-developed, but there are a few places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. I would rate coherence as a 4, as the text is generally well-organized and the ideas are connected, but there are a few instances of abrupt shifts or unclear connections.

Now, I'll summarize my findings and assign the final scores based on the evaluation criteria.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Redundant use of "or to" in "Something has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both."
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous reference in "the cord snapping before it ought to snap."
- [PUNCTUATION] Potential comma splice in "And we ate, and we drank, and we ate again; with no thought..."
- [LEXICON] Archaic word choice in "morn" that may confuse modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from personal anecdote to philosophical discussion of Christmas's decline
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between children's role in Christmas traditions and the impact of 19th-century philosophers
- [CLARITY] Dense philosophical concepts about faith and science could benefit from clearer connections
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
