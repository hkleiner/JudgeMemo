Alright, let's start by analyzing the text for fluency and coherence issues. 

**Fluency Issues:**
Looking at the text, I notice some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, in the sentence "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised as well as we do," there's a missing comma after "did" which makes the sentence run-on. Also, the phrase "the man in the street might stare open-mouthed and talk about her brother" uses "her" which could be confusing if the context isn't clear that the sister is female. There are instances where the sentence structure is complex and could be clearer, like in "So in dealing with things of art, Reynolds said much to his audience that his own practice did not bear out." The lack of punctuation and the run-on nature of some sentences might affect fluency.

**Coherence Issues:**
The text is a biographical essay on Reynolds, and while it flows generally, there are some transitions that could be smoother. For instance, the shift from discussing Reynolds' early life to his time in Italy is abrupt. Also, some paragraphs jump between different aspects of Reynolds' life and work without clear transitions, like from his return to England to his studio locations. There's a mention of his personal flaws and how he overcame them, but the connection between his personal growth and his professional achievements isn't always clear. The text also references other artists and historical figures without sufficient context, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the period.

**Scoring:**
For fluency, the text is mostly readable with some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but nothing that severely hinders understanding. I'd rate this around a 4.5. For coherence, the text is generally coherent with a logical progression, but some transitions and contextual references could be improved. I'd give it a 4 as well.
