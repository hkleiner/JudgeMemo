Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentences and older language. I need to check for grammatical errors, syntax issues, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing.

Looking at the first chapter, the sentences are long and convoluted. For example, the first paragraph has a run-on sentence that's hard to follow. There are instances where the punctuation might not be sufficient to separate ideas, leading to confusion. Also, some phrases like "I had perhaps even had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the patronising" are awkward. The use of words like "lucubrations" might be archaic and less common, which could affect fluency for some readers.

In the second chapter, there's a sentence: "The effect of my visit to Bridges was to turn me out for more profundity." The phrase "turn me out for more profundity" is a bit unclear and might be a case of awkward phrasing. There's also a part where the sentence structure is complex: "I’m afraid I even watched the result of my manœuvre, but up to luncheon I watched in vain." The use of "manœuvre" with an 'e' instead of 'oe' is a spelling error.

Now, checking for coherence. The story is a narrative with a clear progression, but the dense and complex sentences might make it hard to follow the plot. The transition between the two chapters is smooth, but the dense language could make the story feel disjointed. The narrative structure is logical, but the archaic language and complex syntax might make it challenging for some readers to follow the flow of ideas. There are some instances where the cause and effect are not immediately clear due to the sentence structure. For example, in the first chapter, the relationship between Corvick's actions and the author's response isn't immediately clear because of the long sentences and lack of clear transitions.

Putting this all together, for fluency, the main issues are the complex and convoluted sentences, archaic language, and some spelling errors. For coherence, the dense language and complex structure make it harder to follow the narrative, but the overall structure is logical. The fluency score would be around 3.5 because while there are many issues, the text is still generally readable. The coherence score would be around 3 because the narrative is logical but the complex language and structure make it less coherent for some readers.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex and convoluted sentence structures impede readability. - [SPELLING] Incorrect spelling ("manœuvre" instead of "manoeuvre"). - [LEXICON] Use of archaic/obsolete terms ("lucubrations," "manœuvre") that may confuse modern readers. - [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "I had perhaps even had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the patronising" creates grammatical ambiguity. - [PUNCTUATION] Insufficient punctuation in long sentences creates confusion (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?").

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Dense narrative with complex cause-effect relationships that are difficult to follow due to sentence structure. - [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "they declared vividly at the office" lacks clear antecedent). - [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in narrative focus (e.g., from Corvick's story to Vereker's reaction at dinner) create disjointedness. - [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs, particularly in Chapter II where the narrative abruptly shifts from the author's internal thoughts to external dialogue. - [COHESION] Overuse of indirect speech and nested clauses disrupts narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
