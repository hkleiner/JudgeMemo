Okay, let's start by reading through the text carefully. The story is about Little Jack Rabbit and Danny Fox, with several chapters. First, I need to evaluate the fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

For fluency, I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. Let me go through the text again, checking each sentence for errors. 

In the first chapter, "whom should he see but Danny Fox..." – that's a common phrase, so maybe okay. Then "No, sir. Whenever Danny Fox was around there was sure to be trouble." The use of "there was sure to be" is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. "Mrs. John Rabbit gave her head a jerk..." Wait, the name is "Mrs. Rabbit" earlier, but here it's "Mrs. John Rabbit." That's a possible inconsistency in names. 

Next, "If he had only gone inside the house to ask his mother." The structure here is correct. Then the poem in the first chapter: "Now everybody don’t get scared" – "don’t" should be "doesn’t" for subject-verb agreement. That's a grammar error. 

In the second chapter, "Mr. Merry Sun knew something was wrong..." Using a personified "Mr. Sun" is a stylistic choice, but the sentence is clear. "He knew if anybody went with that old robber something mighty unpleasant would surely happen." The double adverb "surely" might be redundant. 

In the third chapter, "Old Sic’em was a good hunter and wouldn’t leave. That’s what the Farmer’s Boy thought..." The sentence is a bit long but still understandable. 

In the fourth chapter, "You see, it had happened on the night he had tiptoed..." The repetition of "had" might be a bit awkward. 

Looking at other parts, I notice some missing commas in dialogue tags. For example, "answered the little rabbit; "but stay where you are..." The semicolon before the dialogue might be better as a comma. Also, some sentences have inconsistent punctuation, like missing periods or commas. 

For coherence, the story is a fable with a clear progression. The chapters are structured to build the plot. However, there are a few points where the flow might be confusing. In the second chapter, the transition from the Farmer's Boy to Danny Fox's reaction is smooth. However, in the third chapter, the shift to Mrs. Fox and their escape might be a bit abrupt. Also, the poem in the first chapter is part of the narrative, but it's not clear if it's a separate stanza or part of the story. 

Another point is the name inconsistency: "Mrs. John Rabbit" versus "Mrs. Rabbit" earlier. That could confuse readers. Also, in the chapter about the alarm, the transition from the rats to the farmer's wife is logical. However, the mention of "two stories ago" in the last chapter might be confusing if the reader hasn't been following closely. 

There's also a possible inconsistency in the timeline. The story jumps between different characters and events, which could affect coherence if not clearly connected. However, the chapters are labeled, so that helps with organization. 

Overall, the text is mostly fluent and coherent, with some minor issues in grammar and name consistency. The coherence is good, with a logical progression, but there are a few abrupt transitions and inconsistencies that could be improved.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Now everybody don’t get scared" (subject-verb agreement error).  
- [SPELLING] "Sic’em" inconsistent with "Sic’em" (hyphenation/spacing inconsistency).  
- [SYNTAX] "He didn’t want the Farmer’s Boy to hear him" (awkward phrasing; better: "he didn’t want the Farmer’s Boy to hear him").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in dialogue tags (e.g., "answered the little rabbit; "but stay where you are...").  
- [LEXICON] "Mrs. John Rabbit" (inconsistent naming; earlier called "Mrs. Rabbit").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Mrs. Fox’s dialogue to Danny Fox’s escape plan (Chapter 2).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear how Danny Fox and family evade the Farmer’s Boy despite the shovel digging (Chapter 3).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "two stories ago" in the final chapter.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Name inconsistency ("Mrs. John Rabbit" vs. "Mrs. Rabbit").  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the alarm chapter to the Willow Tree chapter.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
