Alright, I'm going to evaluate the text for fluency and coherence. Let me read through the text and identify any issues.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] The text has some awkward phrasing and grammatical errors. For example, "the glovemaker looked out of his sombre house over the sunlit slopes of the grey-green olive-trees that stretched away to the deep blue waters of the sea" is a run-on sentence with poor structure.
- [SYNTAX] There are instances of awkward syntax that make the text harder to follow, such as "the wizardry of the flower-garden of France never left him, casting its spell over all his thinking, and calling to him to utter it to the world."
- [LEXICON] Some word choices seem overly complex or archaic for the context, like "pleasaunces" and "gadding fashions."
- [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation, such as the lack of commas in long, complex sentences.
- [WORD CHOICE] Some phrases use words that are not commonly used in modern English, making the text feel outdated or difficult to understand, such as "wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet."
- [SENTENCE STRUCTURE] The text contains very long sentences with multiple clauses that are difficult to follow, such as the sentence describing the mercer's thoughts about Paris.
- [PUNCTUATION] The use of em-dashes and ellipses appears inconsistent and sometimes confusing.
- [GRAMMAR] There are instances of subject-verb agreement issues, such as "the nations, weary of war, agreed to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748."

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions, such as from the description of Grasse to political events in France.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is somewhat disjointed, with the story of Fragonard's life interwoven with historical events and commentary on French art and politics.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt or missing, making the flow of the text difficult to follow.
- [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or confusing, such as the description of the Pompadour's role in French politics and her influence on art.
- [SEQUENCE] The chronological sequence of events is not always clear, making it difficult to follow the timeline of Fragonard's life and the historical context.
- [FOCUS] The text sometimes strays from the main narrative to provide extensive details about historical events that are only tangentially related to Fragonard's life.
- [COHESION] The text lacks cohesive devices that would help connect ideas and maintain a logical flow, such as transitional phrases or clear signposts.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The narrative perspective shifts between third-person omniscient and more journalistic style, which can be disorienting for the reader.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

**Fluency Score:** 3.5 - The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical and syntactical issues that interrupt the flow and clarity in noticeable ways.

**Coherence Score:** 3 - The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.
