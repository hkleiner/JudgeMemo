Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user wants me to check for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll go through the text paragraph by paragraph.

First paragraph: "Amongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean François Millet stands out prominently." The word "Amongst" is British English; maybe that's a style choice. "A long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin..." The word "betwixt" is archaic and might be a bit jarring. Also, the sentence structure here is a bit complex but not necessarily incorrect. 

Next, "It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position..." The phrasing here is a bit awkward. "Has come to occupy" could be smoother. 

Looking at other parts: "His peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a fidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries possess." The use of "possess" is repeated, which might be a minor issue. 

In the sentence about the Dutchmen and Millet: "In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound and sympathetic rendering..." The em dash usage is correct, but maybe a comma would be better. 

Then, "Their temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth century does to the nineteenth." The structure here is a bit confusing. The comparison might be unclear. 

"Living, as he always did, a life of struggle..." The "as he always did" is a bit awkward. Maybe "as he always lived" would be better. 

In the section about the Angelus: "The two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most touching..." The word "symbolical" is correct, but "symbolic" might be more modern. 

Now for coherence. The text is about Millet and his place in the tradition of peasant painters. The flow from Brueghel to the Dutch painters to Millet seems logical. However, there are some jumps. For example, after discussing the Dutch painters, the text moves to changes over two centuries, which is a bit abrupt. 

The transition from discussing the Dutchmen's brutality to Millet's gentleness is okay, but the connection could be smoother. Also, when the author starts discussing the "Angelus" painting, the shift from general discussion to specific example is clear, but the explanation of why it's not sentimental could be more tightly connected to the previous points. 

The section about the "Sheep Pen" painting seems a bit out of place compared to the previous discussion of Millet's temperament and style. It's a good example, but the transition from the philosophical aspects to the specific painting example is abrupt. 

There's also some repetition in the arguments about Millet's style, such as his restraint and focus on truth over virtuosity. These points are made in different sections, which might make the text feel a bit redundant. 

Overall, the text is well-structured but has some minor issues in fluency and coherence. For fluency, the main problems are some archaic or awkward phrasing and minor grammatical issues. For coherence, the transitions between sections and ideas could be smoother in a few places.
