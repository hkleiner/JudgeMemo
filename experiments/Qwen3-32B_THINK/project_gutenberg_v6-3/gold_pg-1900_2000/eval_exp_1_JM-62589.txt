Let me analyze the text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

## Fluency Analysis:

I'll look for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1) Overall, the text appears to be written in 19th century English with archaic spellings and phrasing that are consistent throughout. This is not an error but rather a stylistic choice.

2) I don't see any obvious spelling errors in the text.

3) I notice some occasional punctuation issues:
   - Some dialogue lines are not properly separated with commas
   - Some sentences have inconsistent capitalization of names

4) There are a few grammatical issues:
   - "There was a Molly, and with her we must deal first" - "Molly" is mentioned before it's introduced
   - "One July morning, over a hundred years ago there stood" - this is awkward phrasing
   - "He was going to fight. If I come back" - tense inconsistency

5) Some word choice issues:
   - "He would not leave me, but even if he did he would come back" - awkward phrasing
   - "She, proud, free Debby Mason!" - awkward sentence structure

6) Some punctuation issues:
   - "I won’t go with you!” she shrieked, “I’ll go with father! He loves me, and, and beside I promised mother!” - repetition of "and"
   - "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes." - awkward sentence structure

7) Some inconsistencies in quotation usage:
   - Some dialogue lines use em-dashes instead of quotation marks
   - Some dialogue lines are not properly enclosed in quotes

8) Some awkward phrasing:
   - "He was going to be a man, so help me God for her sake and yours—or I won’t come back!"
   - "You’re as good as a lad any day, and a better fighter I swear than your daddy."

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency as a 4. There are a few minor issues with grammar, phrasing, and punctuation that are noticeable but don't significantly disrupt the overall readability.

## Coherence Analysis:

I'll look at how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities, and narrative consistency.

1) The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end. It follows a logical progression as Debby Mason's life changes from being with her father to being with Mrs. Lane.

2) There are some transitions that could be smoother:
   - The transition from Debby's father leaving to her being taken in by Mrs. Lane could be more clearly connected
   - The transition from the first chapter to the second chapter is abrupt

3) Some parts of the story are a bit confusing:
   - The exact nature of Debby's relationship with her mother is somewhat unclear
   - The political context (revolutionary period) is mentioned but not clearly explained
   - The motivations of some characters are not fully explained

4) There are some inconsistencies:
   - Debby's personality seems to change abruptly from angry and rebellious to contemplative and reflective
   - The shift in tone from the dramatic confrontation with her father to her time with Mrs. Lane is abrupt
   - Some details about Debby's past and her father's history are mentioned but not fully developed

5) There are some logical gaps:
   - Why is Debby's father being expelled from the town?
   - Why is Debby being bound out to Mrs. Lane?
   - What is the significance of Debby's desire to be a boy?

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The story is generally coherent and has a clear narrative, but there are some noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and logical gaps that affect the reading experience.

Now, I'll summarize the specific issues for each category:
