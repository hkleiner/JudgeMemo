Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues to provide a proper evaluation.

First, I'll read through the text to understand its content and structure. This appears to be an essay discussing two contrasting types of mind: one that is retrospective/legal/submissive and one that is forward-looking/creative/legislative. The author explores how these different mental approaches affect morality, decision-making, and historical events.

Now, let me evaluate for fluency issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1) [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and run-on, making them difficult to follow (e.g., "The first of these two types of mind, and it is, I think, the predominant type, the type of the majority of living people, is that which seems scarcely to think of the future at all...")
2) [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often inverted or unusual, which can be confusing (e.g., "It will lead into my subject most conveniently to contrast and separate two divergent types of mind...")
3) [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences use commas excessively, creating run-on sentences or confusing phrasing
4) [LEXICON] Some words are used in archaic or obscure ways that might be difficult for modern readers to understand
5) [PUNCTUATION] The use of em-dashes and other punctuation is inconsistent
6) [SYNTAX] There are some awkward or unnatural phrasings (e.g., "The former type of mind, when one gets it in its purity...")
7) [SPELLING] There appears to be a typo with "æsthetic" which should be "esthetic" or "aesthetic"
8) [SYNTAX] Some sentences use passive voice in a way that makes the writing feel less direct and engaging
9) [PUNCTUATION] The text has some missing commas where they would help clarify meaning
10) [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and dense, making the text feel more academic than accessible

Now, let me evaluate for coherence issues:

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1) [LOGIC] The essay jumps between abstract concepts and specific examples without clear transitions
2) [STRUCTURE] The essay follows a logical progression, but the dense writing style sometimes obscures the flow of ideas
3) [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation for readers who may not be familiar with the philosophical context
4) [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt or unclear
5) [STRUCTURE] The essay is quite long and dense, making it difficult to track the main argument at times
6) [LOGIC] Some of the examples (e.g., the wars in England and South Africa) are not fully explained or contextualized
7) [CLARITY] The distinction between the two types of mind is clear, but the implications of this distinction are sometimes not fully explained
8) [LOGIC] The essay makes some sweeping generalizations about "the legal mind" and "the creative mind" that could be more nuanced
9) [STRUCTURE] The essay could benefit from clearer signposting of its argument and structure
10) [CLARITY] Some of the philosophical concepts are presented without sufficient context for readers who may not be familiar with them

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For fluency, I notice that the text has several issues with complex sentence structure, awkward phrasing, and some spelling/punctuation problems. However, the overall message is still understandable, and the writing is generally clear despite these issues. The text is well-written for an academic/philosophical essay, but could be more accessible to a general audience.

For coherence, the essay presents a clear central argument and maintains a logical progression throughout. The distinction between the two types of mind is consistent, and the examples support this distinction. However, the dense writing style and occasional abrupt transitions make the text less accessible to some readers.

Based on these assessments:

FLUENCY SCORE: The text has multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways, but it remains mostly understandable. This places it around a 3.

COHERENCE SCORE: The text is generally coherent with a clear and logical progression, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and some unclear transitions that affect the reading experience. This places it around a 3.5.
