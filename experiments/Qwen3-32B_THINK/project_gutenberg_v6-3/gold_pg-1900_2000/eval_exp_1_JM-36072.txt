Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. 

First, I'll go through the text looking for any obvious errors. The text is quite long, so I'll need to be thorough. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "Each generation takes a special pleasure in removing the household gods of its parents from their pedestals, and consigning them to the cupboard." The sentence is long but grammatically correct. The structure is a bit complex, but that's common in academic writing.

Next sentence: "The prophet or pioneer, after being at first declared to be unintelligible or absurd, has a brief spell of popularity, after which he is said to be conventional, and then antiquated." The structure here is a bit convoluted, but still grammatically sound. 

Moving on, I notice some instances where the sentence structure is complex, which might be a bit confusing but not necessarily incorrect. For example, "We may find more than one reason for this. A movement has more to fear from its disciples than from its critics." These sentences are clear but might be considered a bit wordy.

I don't see any obvious spelling mistakes. The text uses formal language, which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, there are some instances of awkward phrasing. For example, "The German Von Eicken found, in this tendency of all human movements to provoke violent reactions, the master key of history." The placement of the prepositional phrase "in this tendency..." is a bit off, making the sentence a bit awkward. 

Another example: "The Catholic Church began by renouncing the world, and became the heir of the defunct Roman empire." The transition from "renouncing the world" to becoming an heir is abrupt, but the grammar is correct. 

There are also instances where the use of passive voice might make the sentences less direct. For example, "The Industrial Revolution began in reality before the accession of George III..." The passive voice here is acceptable but could be more active for clarity. 

Looking at the paragraph about the English nation in the 18th century: "The roads between villages were mere tracks across the common, often so bad that carts were driven by preference through the fields, as they still are in Greece." The comparison to Greece is a bit out of place and might be a factual error, but it's more of a content issue than a fluency one. 

In the section discussing the working class: "It was repealed only when the ruined farmers were abandoning their land, and the glebe-owning clergy their livings." The sentence is a bit choppy but grammatically correct. 

I notice some instances where the author uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures, which might be challenging but are not errors. For example, "Modern sociologists have drawn lurid pictures of the condition of the working class during the earlier part of the last century." The word "lurid" is appropriate here.

Overall, there are a few instances of awkward phrasing and complex sentence structures, but no major grammatical errors. The text is generally fluent and well-structured, though some sentences could be more concise. 

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow together and how logically the text is organized. 

The text is a historical analysis of the Victorian Age and its context within broader historical trends. The author discusses the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and their impacts on society. 

The structure starts with a general discussion of historical movements and their cyclical nature, then moves to specific examples like the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. The text then shifts to a description of the English nation in the 18th century before the Industrial Revolution, and continues with the social and economic changes that followed.

One issue I notice is that the transition between the general discussion of historical cycles and the specific examples is abrupt. The author jumps from talking about Von Eicken's theory to specific historical events without a smooth transition. 

Another coherence issue is the shift in focus from the broader historical trends to the specific case of England in the 18th century. The connection between these sections is not always clear. For example, the paragraph about the English nation in the 18th century seems to come out of nowhere after discussing the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. 

The text also jumps from discussing the Industrial Revolution to the state of the working class without a clear transition. Additionally, the author brings up the example of Greece in the context of 18th-century England, which is an anachronism and disrupts the coherence.

There are also instances where the author introduces new ideas without sufficient explanation. For example, the discussion of the Catholic Church's transformation is introduced without linking it to the previous points about historical cycles and reactions. 

The conclusion about the Victorian Age and the "age of hope" is somewhat abrupt and doesn't tie together all the previous points as effectively as it could. The author ends with a reflection on the progress made, but the connection to the earlier discussions is not clearly established.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are some abrupt transitions and shifts in focus that could be improved. The ideas are related, but the flow between them is not always smooth, which affects the overall coherence.
