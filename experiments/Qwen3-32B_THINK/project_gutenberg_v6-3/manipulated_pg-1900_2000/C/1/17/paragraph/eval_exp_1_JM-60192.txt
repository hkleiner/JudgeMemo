Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence using the given criteria. Let's start with fluency.

First, I'll look for grammar issues. The text has some contractions like "altho" instead of "although" and "it’s" correctly used. There are a few instances where commas are missing or misplaced, like in "After picking, the berries are dried in the sun or in kilns until dark brown and then separated from the stalk." The comma after "After picking" is correct, but maybe the structure could be smoother. Also, some sentences are run-on, like the one about Bahá’u’lláh’s life and writings. It's a long sentence with multiple clauses that could use a semicolon or a period.

Spelling errors: "altho" is a common abbreviation but might be considered informal. "Pimento" is spelled consistently, but I need to check if that's the correct term. "Cordate" in "oblong accumminate, ¾ to 1½ in. long and ¼ to ¾ in. in diameter" – "accumminate" might be a typo for "acuminate." Also, "C. Acumination" should probably be "C. acuminate." There's a mention of "C. frutesens" which might be "frutescens." The word "thoroly" in "thoroly washed" is misspelled as "thoroly" instead of "thoroughly."

Syntax and phrasing: Some sentences are awkwardly structured. For example, "The dried berries are light, brittle, of roundish form and crowned with the remains of the flower calyx in the shape of a raised, seared-like ring" – "seared-like" might be a typo for "seared-like" or "seared-like"? Maybe "seared-like" is intended but not standard. Also, "If they were to do nothing else, the effects which Bahá’u’lláh’s life and writings have already had should command the earnest attention..." – this sentence is confusing and doesn't logically connect with the surrounding text about allspice. It seems out of place, which is a coherence issue but also affects fluency.

Punctuation: The use of em dashes and semicolons is inconsistent. For example, "the leaves--which when fresh abound in essential oil--are 5 in. long" – the em dashes are correct here. However, some sentences end with a semicolon where a period might be better. Also, the use of "etc." in "meat, fish, other vegetables, etc." is okay, but sometimes overused.

Now for coherence. The text is a book on spices, so each chapter should focus on a specific spice. The chapter on allspice starts well, but then there's a paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh that seems unrelated. This is a major coherence issue as it disrupts the flow and logical progression. Similarly, in the capsicum chapter, there are mentions of Reynolds and Boucher, which are about painters and not related to peppers. These sections are jarring and make the text confusing.

The structure of each chapter is generally logical, but the insertion of unrelated topics breaks the coherence. For example, the part about Bahá’u’lláh in the allspice chapter and the painter sections in the capsicum chapter are out of place. The transitions between topics are abrupt, and there's no clear connection between the inserted content and the main subject. Also, some sections jump from one idea to another without explanation, like the part about family size and social ambitions in the capsicum chapter. This is confusing and affects the overall coherence.

The text also has some repetition, like the mention of different capsicum species and their characteristics, which is necessary for the topic but could be organized better. However, the main coherence issues are the unrelated paragraphs that interrupt the flow. These instances make the text less coherent and harder to follow.

For fluency, the main issues are the spelling errors ("altho," "thoroly," "C. frutesens"), some awkward phrasing, and the long, run-on sentences. The coherence issues are the unrelated sections that disrupt the logical flow. Considering the criteria, the fluency score would be around 3.5 to 4, but the coherence is lower due to the major disruptions. However, the text is mostly readable with some issues, so fluency might be a 4. Coherence, due to the unrelated paragraphs, might be a 3.5.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "altho" instead of "although"  
- [SPELLING] "thoroly" misspelled as "thoroly"  
- [SPELLING] "C. frutesens" likely should be "frutescens"
