Let me analyze the text to evaluate its fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "Of Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known." - The structure is awkward and should be "Little is known of Boucher's wander-years in Italy."

2. [GRAMMAR] "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste..." - The placement of "in fact" is awkward and the sentence structure is awkward.

3. [GRAMMAR] "However, whether he were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short or not..." - The semicolon is incorrectly used between two independent clauses.

4. [GRAMMAR] "He appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like the three years' conventional Italian study..." - The structure is awkward and the use of em dash is not standard.

5. [SPELLING] "The experience of Divine Revelation, touched on only at secondhand in surviving accounts..." - The word "secondhand" is spelled incorrectly (should be "second-hand").

6. [GRAMMAR] "The coachman was killed on the spot, and the guard escaped with bruises." - The sentence is grammatically correct but the transition from a fatal accident to a minor injury is abrupt and could be smoother.

7. [GRAMMAR] "The experience of Divine Revelation, touched on only at secondhand in surviving accounts of the lives of the Buddha, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Muḥammad, is described graphically in Bahá’u’lláh’s own words:" - The sentence is extremely long and complex, making it difficult to follow.

8. [GRAMMAR] "During the days I lay in the prison of Ṭihrán, though the galling weight of the chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still in those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the crown of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit of a lofty mountain." - The archaic verb form "precipitateth" is inconsistent with the rest of the text.

9. [GRAMMAR] "Coachmen and guards were apt to leave too much to the honour of the horses when stopping, and it was not at all uncommon for the team to start on its journey with nobody on the box." - The sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly structured.

10. [GRAMMAR] "An old coachman told Lord Algernon St. Maur that on one night's drive he met two coaches without any driver!" - The exclamation mark at the end is inappropriate for a factual statement.

11. [GRAMMAR] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." - The placement of the comma is incorrect.

12. [GRAMMAR] "Of course the faults of a man and the merits of his work are distinct and stand apart from one another, but we are too apt to look at Reynolds the man in the light of Goldsmith's epitaph..." - The sentence is grammatically correct but the structure is complex and could be clearer.

13. [GRAMMAR] "It is far more interesting to see great men as they lived." - The sentence is grammatically correct but feels abrupt after the previous one.

14. [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" - This line seems to be an instruction to the reader rather than part of the main text.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Boucher to Nimrod's description of the coachman without a clear transition.

2. [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing the coachman to an account of a specific accident without a clear transition.

3. [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing accidents to a completely different topic about Divine Revelation without a clear transition.

4. [LOGIC] The text shifts from the Divine Revelation passage back to discussing coachmen and guards without a clear transition.

5. [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing coachmen to making a philosophical statement about great men without a clear transition.

6. [LOGIC] The text ends with an instruction to the reader about output format, which is out of place and unrelated to the rest of the content.

7. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure or organization. It jumps between different topics (aristocracy, coaching, Boucher, Divine Revelation, etc.) without a logical progression.

8. [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a collection of different essays or articles pasted together without integration or transitions.

9. [CLARITY] The text often discusses complex topics (like Divine Revelation) in the same context as more mundane topics (like coach accidents), making the overall purpose and focus unclear.

10. [TRANSITION] The text lacks effective transitions between paragraphs and topics, making it difficult to follow the author's intended message or narrative.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations.

For fluency, the text has several grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but it remains largely readable. The most serious issues are the incorrect semicolon, the awkward sentence structures, and the inconsistent verb forms. I would rate this as a 3.5.

For coherence, the text has significant issues with logical progression and structure. The abrupt shifts between topics and the lack of integration make it difficult to follow. The most serious issues are the lack of clear structure and the many abrupt topic shifts. I would rate this as a 2.5.

Let me review my analysis once more to ensure accuracy:

For fluency:
- There are several grammatical issues, but the text remains largely readable.
- The most serious issues include incorrect semicolon use, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent verb forms.
- The text is generally understandable despite these issues.
- I believe a score of 3.5 is appropriate.

For coherence:
- The text has significant issues with logical progression and structure.
- There are numerous abrupt shifts between topics with no clear transitions.
- The text appears to be a collection of different pieces pasted together without integration.
- The most serious issue is the lack of clear structure and organization.
- I believe a score of 2.5 is appropriate.

I'll now format my response according to the required format.
