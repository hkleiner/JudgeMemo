Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the text's fluency and coherence according to the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The text is a biography of Rosa Bonheur. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and punctuation issues. Let me scan through.

Looking at the first paragraph: "In 1821, a young painter of brilliant promise was living in Bordeaux." That's fine. Then "His name was Raymond Bonheur. But the fairies who presided at his birth omitted to endow him with riches, in addition to talent." The structure is a bit old-fashioned but grammatically correct. 

Next, "The hardships of existence compelled him to relinquish his dreams of glory and to pursue the irksome task of earning his daily bread." "Irk some" should be "irksome" as one word. That's a spelling mistake. 

Then, "The artist became a drawing master and went the rounds of private lessons." Maybe "went the rounds" is a bit awkward, but it's a set phrase. 

"Among his pupils he made the acquaintance of a young girl, Mlle. Sophie Marquis, as penniless as himself, but attractive and gentle, full of courage, and displaying exceptional ability in music." The comma usage here is correct. 

"A similarity of tastes and opinions drew these two artistic natures toward each other." "Toward" is correct. 

"They fell in love, and the marriage service united their destinies." This is a bit abrupt. Maybe "service" is correct, but the sentence could be smoother. 

Continuing to the next paragraphs: "No doubt, political corruption was rampant; but it was not till George III tried to govern himself by means of corruption, that its consequences were disastrous." The semicolon and comma usage here is a bit off. It should be a semicolon or a period. Also, "govern himself" is correct. 

"The loss of America was the first serious blow to the aristocratic régime." "Régime" is misspelled as "régime" with an accent. 

In the section about Rosa's childhood: "Rosalie could hardly walk before she was drawing and painting everywhere." "Before she was drawing" is correct. 

In the part about the Silvela family: "the latter left Bordeaux in 1828 in order to assume the direction of an institute for boys in Paris." "Institute for boys" is okay. 

In the section about the revolution of 1830: "The revolution of 1830 ensued and Rosa witnessed it develop beneath the windows of her father's dwelling." "Enseued" is correct, but "ensued" is the right spelling. Wait, no, "ensued" is correct. 

Moving to the part about English art in the 18th century: "When one turns to consider English art in the eighteenth century, the name of Joshua Reynolds stands out in a brighter light than any other." That's a long sentence but grammatically correct. 

"Such gifts, if they do not always create a genius, may enable their possessor to achieve work that has certain affinities with the masterpieces of the immortals." The structure is a bit complex but correct. 

In the section about Rosa's school: "She engaged her new comrades in games of mimic warfare, combats, cavalry charges across the flower-beds of the garden which was reduced to ruins before the end of the second day." The relative clause is missing a comma before "which." 

In the part about her father's studio: "While her father scoured the city on his round of lessons, she would shut herself into the studio and work with desperate energy, taking in turn every object hanging on the walls for her models." The phrase "taking in turn every object" might be better as "taking each object in turn." 

In the section about the Louvre: "She wore an eccentric costume, consisting of a sort of dolman with military frogs." "Dolman" is correct. 

In the part about the Salon: "In 1842 she sent three paintings to the Salon: namely, an Evening Effect in a Pasture, a Cow lying in a Pasture, and a Horse for Sale; and in addition to these, a terra-cotta, the Shorn Sheep, which received the approval of the critics." The colon and semicolon usage here is correct. 

Looking for other issues: "The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done, there was exchange of compliments..." This sentence is a bit confusing. The structure is awkward, and it's unclear how the clauses connect. 

Also, "the gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather Prévost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of things?" This sentence is very convoluted and hard to follow. The use of "for is not" is incorrect; it should be "for is he not." 

There are a few instances of inconsistent punctuation, like missing commas in complex sentences. For example, "The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done, there was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of good-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of snuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the Court and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth; the gossip is not without authority and weight..." The em dash and semicolon usage here is a bit jarring. 

Now, for coherence. The text is a biography, so the flow should be logical. The chapters are "Childhood and Youth" and "The First Successes." The first chapter starts with Raymond Bonheur, then his marriage, Rosa's birth, their struggles, and her early life. Then there's a shift to discussing English art in the 18th century, which seems out of place. This is a coherence issue because it's a non-sequitur. 

The mention of Bahá’u’lláh and Bábí community in Baghdad also seems unrelated to Rosa Bonheur's story. That's a significant coherence problem as it disrupts the narrative flow. 

The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, after discussing Rosa's early life, it suddenly talks about English art and then jumps to Bahá’u’lláh. These shifts make the text disjointed. 

There's also a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs. For example, after discussing the cholera outbreak, the text moves to Raymond's change of residence and then his involvement with Saint-Simonism. The connection between these events isn't clearly explained. 

The section about the Louvre and her studies is followed by a paragraph about the Rue Rumford and her animal studies, which is logical, but the sudden shift to Bahá’u’lláh is confusing. 

Overall, the text has some coherence issues due to abrupt shifts in topic and lack of transitions. The inclusion of unrelated historical topics disrupts the narrative flow. 

For fluency, the main issues are the spelling errors like "irksome" (should be one word), "régime" (accented), and the awkward sentence structures in some parts. The convoluted sentence about the sand and snuff-boxes is a major fluency problem. 

So, for fluency, there are several minor issues but also some more serious ones. The text is mostly fluent but has some problems that might interrupt the flow. 

For coherence, the main issues are the non-sequiturs and unrelated topics. The text is generally coherent but has significant disruptions that affect the overall structure and flow.
