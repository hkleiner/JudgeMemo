Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in the text. First, I'll need to check for any grammar, spelling, or syntax problems. The text is quite long, so I'll go through it paragraph by paragraph.

Starting with the first chapter, the sentence structure seems okay, but I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, "He had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid himself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound French fashion." The use of "had founded" followed by "had rid" and "was painting" might be a bit jarring. It's a mix of past perfect and simple past, which could be confusing. That's a [SYNTAX] issue.

Next, "The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift, that he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what he wanted to acquire..." The comma splice here is problematic. The phrase "that he displayed..." is a dependent clause, and the comma before "of rapidly" doesn't correctly separate the clauses. This is a [GRAMMAR] error.

Looking at the sentence: "The youth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on the eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that it is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or the pupil without most careful evidence." The semicolon before "and" is correct, but the structure is a bit long and could be clearer. Maybe a [SYNTAX] issue here.

In the second paragraph, "But who will maintain that all those who formed the motley throng of the medieval pilgrimages came with their minds properly attuned..." The use of "motley throng" is correct, but the sentence is a bit convoluted. The structure might be confusing, so [SYNTAX] again.

Moving to the part about Reynolds: "There is no doubt that the sixteenth-century Venetians impressed Reynolds as much as they impressed Ruskin at a later date..." The repetition of "impressed" is a bit redundant. That's a [LEXICON] issue.

Another sentence: "He was always perfect master of his self-control..." Missing article "a" before "perfect master." That's a [GRAMMAR] error.

Now, checking for coherence. The text jumps between different historical figures and events without clear transitions. For example, after discussing Thomas Becket and the pilgrimage, the text suddenly shifts to Boucher and art techniques. There's no clear connection between these sections. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue.

Also, in the chapter about Canterbury, the text starts with German Von Eicken's historical theory, then jumps to Roman invasions, then to Saxon conversions. These transitions are abrupt and don't clearly link the ideas. That's a [LOGIC] issue.

The mention of Bahá’u’lláh’s life and work seems out of place in the middle of discussing Canterbury's history. It's a non-sequitur and disrupts the flow. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue.

The text also has some sections where the cause-effect relationships aren't clear. For instance, the discussion about the Roman roads and the importance of Canterbury's location is presented without explaining the connection to the later Saxon conversions. That's a [LOGIC] issue.

There are also some ambiguous references, like "these people" when discussing the Palaeolithic Age. It's unclear who "these people" refers to without context. That's a [CLARITY] issue.

Overall, the fluency issues are mostly minor but present in several places, affecting the readability. The coherence issues are more significant, with abrupt transitions and disconnected ideas making the overall structure confusing. 

For the fluency score, considering the number of issues but the text is still mostly readable, I'd say a 4. For coherence, the significant structural and logical issues would lower the score to a 3.
