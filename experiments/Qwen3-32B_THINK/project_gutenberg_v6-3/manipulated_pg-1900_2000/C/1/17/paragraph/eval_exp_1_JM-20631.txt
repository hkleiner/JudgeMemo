Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll look for fluency issues:

Fluency issues (grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, punctuation):
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Arthur Davis, in whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures..." - This is a passive construction that's awkwardly phrased. It would be clearer as "The series of lectures... was founded in whose memory by Mr. Arthur Davis."
- [GRAMMAR] "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." - The double dash and complex structure makes this sentence hard to follow.
- [GRAMMAR] "He would receive no payment for any of his religious work or writings." - This sentence is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "Part of the profits that accrued from the publication of his edition of 'The Services of the Synagogue' has been devoted..." - Subject-verb agreement issue ("profits" is plural, but "has" is singular).
- [GRAMMAR] "We were consigned for four months to a place foul beyond comparison...." - This sentence is cut off mid-paragraph without any clear connection to the following text.
- [GRAMMAR] "Thou shalt suck the milk of nations." - This is an old-fashioned form of "you shall" that's inconsistent with the rest of the text's modern style.
- [GRAMMAR] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel..." - This is a passive construction that could be simplified for better clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] "It is by this canon that we must interpret the concept of a Chosen People, and so much else in our Scriptures." - This is an awkward phrasing that could be simplified.
- [GRAMMAR] "This is the only 'Guide to the Perplexed,' and Maimonides but made confusion worse confounded when by allegations of allegory." - This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.

Now for coherence issues:

Coherence issues (logical sequence, transitions, clarity, structure):
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from a biography of Arthur Davis to a discussion of ritual languages and then to a completely different narrative about Reynolds and painting, with no clear connection between these sections.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has an abrupt transition from the biography of Arthur Davis to a section about ritual languages, then to an unrelated section about Reynolds, and then back to the discussion of the Chosen People.
- [LOGIC] The section about Reynolds seems completely out of place in a text about Arthur Davis and the Chosen People. There's no logical connection established between these topics.
- [LOGIC] The text begins with a biography of Arthur Davis, then shifts to a discussion of ritual languages, then to a completely different narrative about Reynolds, and then back to the original topic of the Chosen People. This creates a disjointed reading experience.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between different topics and sections are abrupt and lack any connecting phrases or explanations.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions "We were consigned for four months to a place foul beyond comparison...." but this sentence is cut off mid-paragraph without any explanation or connection to the rest of the text.
- [LOGIC] The text contains a quote from the second Psalm but doesn't provide any context or explanation for how this relates to the discussion of the Chosen People.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel..." but doesn't explain how this relates to the overall theme of the text.
- [LOGIC] The text ends with a quote from the second Psalm ("Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord!") but doesn't provide any resolution or connection to the previous discussion.

Based on these issues, I'll now assign scores:

For Fluency:
The text has several grammatical issues and awkward phrasings that affect readability. However, the text is generally understandable despite these issues. I would rate it a 3.5 on the fluency scale - it has noticeable issues that interrupt the flow but is generally readable.

For Coherence:
The text has significant coherence issues, with abrupt transitions between unrelated topics and sections, and a lack of logical connections between different parts of the text. The structure is disjointed and confusing. I would rate it a 2.5 on the coherence scale - it has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort.

Let me review my analysis once more to ensure accuracy:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward passive construction in the opening sentence
- [GRAMMAR] Complex and hard-to-follow sentence structure with double dashes
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issue with "profits" and "has"
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence cut off mid-paragraph with no clear connection to the following text
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of old-fashioned language form ("Thou shalt")
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward passive constructions in several sentences
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent and grammatically incorrect final sentence

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Disjointed structure with multiple unrelated topics
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different sections
- [LOGIC] Completely out-of-place section about Reynolds and painting
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connecting phrases or explanations between topics
- [LOGIC] Disconnected sentence about being consigned to a place
- [LOGIC] Lack of context for biblical quotes
- [LOGIC] Disconnected reference to Reynolds with no explanation

My final assessment:
- Fluency Score: 3.5
- Coherence Score: 2.5
