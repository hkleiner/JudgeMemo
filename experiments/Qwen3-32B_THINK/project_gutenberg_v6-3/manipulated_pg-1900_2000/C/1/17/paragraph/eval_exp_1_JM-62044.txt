Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in the text. The user wants me to identify problems related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I notice some capitalization inconsistencies. For example, "Boucher" is mentioned as "Boucher" but later it's "Boucher" again, but in the first paragraph, "Boucher" is capitalized, which is correct. However, there's a line that says "Louis Quinze--a comely little fellow--with Orleans as Regent." The em dashes here are used correctly, but maybe the double em dash could be a typo. Wait, the user might be using two hyphens instead of em dashes. Let me check the original text again. The original uses "--" which is actually the correct way to denote em dashes in some formatting. So maybe that's okay.

Looking for grammar issues. The sentence "When I was living much with hunters in the American wilderness, I have been struck with the differences..." uses past perfect "have been struck" after a past tense "was living." That's incorrect. It should be "had been struck." Also, "the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little fellow--with Orleans as Regent." The structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe a comma after "Quinze" would help.

Another example: "The history—for it is the simple record as faithful to the facts as my memory serves—of the little lives it deals with, was written not merely to preserve..." The em dashes here are correct, but the sentence structure is a bit complex and could be confusing. Maybe breaking it into two sentences would help. Also, "the history—for it is the simple record..." might be better as "the history, for it is a simple record..."

Spelling issues: I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "heredity," "domestication," "sympathies" all seem correct. 

Syntax: Some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, "The numerous expressions of pleasure at the reading of my history of two pet squirrels, printed in the Century Magazine several years ago, persuaded me that in a more permanent and convenient form it may serve still further the purpose for which it was written..." This is a long sentence that could be split for clarity.

Word choice: Some phrases like "the unsuspected intelligence and moral qualities of a humble creature" are a bit archaic but not incorrect. The use of "tamed animals of any species is for children of almost any growth the means of opening the nature to a higher attainment of human sympathy." The phrase "children of almost any growth" is a bit awkward. Maybe "children of almost any age" would be clearer.

Punctuation: The use of em dashes is consistent, but some sentences might benefit from commas to separate clauses. For example, "I do not discuss the question; I feel for myself..." The semicolon is correct here. 

Now, moving to coherence. The text starts with a discussion about animal intelligence, then shifts to a boy named Boucher, then back to the author's experiences with squirrels, and later mentions historical figures like Joshua Reynolds and Bahá’u’lláh. The transition between these topics is abrupt and not well-connected. The introduction of the Boucher character seems out of place in a text primarily about animals and their treatment. 

The structure is also a bit disjointed. The author jumps between different subjects: animal behavior, personal anecdotes, historical context, and even a gamekeeper's testimony. There's a lack of clear progression from one idea to the next. For example, after discussing the squirrel's impact on forests, the text suddenly mentions Bahá’u’lláh and his work in Baghdad, which seems unrelated to the previous discussion. 

Some ideas are repeated, like the author's stance on animal cruelty and the benefits of domesticating squirrels. While repetition can emphasize a point, it can also make the text feel redundant. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, leading to a disjointed reading experience. 

The conclusion about squirrels and their treatment is mixed with philosophical musings on humanity and sympathy, which might confuse the reader. The final paragraphs about Bahá’u’lláh and the gamekeeper's testimony don't clearly connect back to the main theme, making the overall structure less cohesive.

In terms of coherence, the text lacks a clear narrative flow. The author's personal experiences, historical anecdotes, and scientific observations are not well-integrated, leading to a fragmented structure. The abrupt shifts in topic and the lack of transitional phrases make it difficult to follow the author's argument or the story's progression.

For the fluency score, considering the minor grammatical errors and complex sentence structures, but overall readability, I'd say it's a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent, with some awkward phrasing but not distracting.

For coherence, the disjointed structure and abrupt topic shifts would lower the score. I'd give it a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but has noticeable issues with transitions and logical flow.
