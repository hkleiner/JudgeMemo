Alright, let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what I need to evaluate. The user wants me to rate the text on fluency and coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. I need to identify the most serious problems for each metric, categorize them, and then assign scores.

First, for fluency, I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me scan the text for any issues. The first thing I notice is the title: "-SOME NOTES ON EARLY WOODCUT BOOKS, WITH A CHAPTER ON ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS-". The hyphens at the beginning and end might be a formatting issue rather than a fluency problem, but maybe they're unnecessary. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "The invention of printing books, and the use of wood-blocks for book ornament in place of hand-painting, though it belongs to the period of the degradation of mediæval art, gave an opportunity to the Germans to regain the place..." This is a long sentence with some complex structure. The word "mediæval" uses an archaic 'æ' which might be a stylistic choice but could be a typo if not intentional. 

In the sentence "Unhappily, even at the time of their first woodcut book, the beginning of the end was on them;" the phrase "was on them" is a bit awkward. Maybe "was upon them" would be more natural. 

Moving on, there's a mention of "the Báb had been publicly executed on July 9, 1850." The name "Báb" might be a proper noun, but the context here shifts from woodcut books to the Báb, which seems out of place. This might be a coherence issue rather than fluency. 

In the section about John Zainer's books, there's a sentence that starts with "John Zainer's German Bible of c. 1474 has a full set of pictured letters..." The abbreviation "c." for circa is okay, but it's not clear if it's in italics or not. 

Looking at the paragraph about the De Claris Mulieribus, the sentence "All this is done with admirable invention and romantic meaning, and with very great beauty of design and a full sense of decorative necessities." The phrase "a full sense of decorative necessities" is a bit awkward. 

For fluency issues, I notice some run-on sentences, awkward phrasing, and possible spelling or grammar errors. For example, "The German Von Eicken found, in this tendency of all human movements to provoke violent reactions, the master key of history." The structure here is a bit complex and could be clearer. 

Now, for coherence, the main issue is the shift in topic. The text starts discussing woodcut books and then abruptly moves to the Báb and his execution. This is a significant jump and disrupts the logical flow. Additionally, there are mentions of different printers and their works, but the transition between these sections isn't always smooth. For example, after discussing the Báb, the text goes back to talking about printers in Augsburg and Ulm. 

Another coherence issue is the lack of clear transitions between different sections. The text jumps from one printer to another without clear indicators of how they relate. Also, the mention of "the German Von Eicken" at the end seems disconnected from the rest of the content. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "Anthony Sorg, a little later than these, was a printer somewhat inferior, rather a reprinter in fact, but by dint of reusing the old blocks, or getting them recut and in some cases redesigned, not always to their disadvantage, produced some very beautiful books." The reference to "these" might be unclear to the reader. 

In terms of coherence, the text is generally about woodcut books in Germany, but the shift to the Báb and later to Von Eicken's historical theory disrupts the focus. The reader might find it hard to follow the main topic due to these abrupt changes.

Putting this all together, for fluency, the main issues are run-on sentences, awkward phrasing, and some possible spelling or grammar errors. For coherence, the main problem is the abrupt shift in topics and lack of clear transitions. 

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, the text is mostly fluent but has some issues that are noticeable but don't severely disrupt readability. I would say a 4. For coherence, the shifts in topic and lack of transitions make it a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections between sections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with complex clauses (e.g., "The invention of printing books... gave an opportunity to the Germans...").  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "the beginning of the end was on them" (likely intended as "was upon them").  
- [SPELLING] Use of archaic "mediæval" with ligature 'æ' (may be stylistic but could be inconsistent).  
- [LEXICON] Unclear phrasing in "a full sense of decorative necessities" (awkward word choice).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "the Báb had been publicly executed on July 9, 1850" lacks a comma after "executed").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from woodcut books to the Báb’s execution (unrelated topic).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transitions between sections (e.g., jumping from printers to historical theory of Von Eicken).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "these" in "Anthony Sorg... a little later than these").  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of logical flow between printers and their works (e.g., moving from Zainer to Hohenwang without connection).  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected final paragraph on Von Eicken’s historical theory (irrelevant to main topic).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
