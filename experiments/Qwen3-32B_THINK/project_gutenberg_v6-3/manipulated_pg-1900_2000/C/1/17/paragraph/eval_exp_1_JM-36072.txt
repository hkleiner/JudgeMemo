Let me evaluate this text according to the given criteria.

First, I'll analyze the text for fluency issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] - "The reign of Queen Victoria, which I have chosen to mark the limits of my survey to-day, covered the latter half of this saeculum mirabile, the most wonderful century in human history." The phrasing is awkward and the sentence structure is complex and confusing.
2. [SYNTAX] - "The French Revolution, which coincided with its first stages, helped to break the continuity between the old order and the new, and both by its direct influence and by the vigorous reactions which it generated cleft society into conflicting elements." This sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses that make it difficult to follow.
3. [SPELLING] - "The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down the French at Blenheim--a day that made "Malbrook" a name of dread to every French child" The use of "Malbrook" appears to be a spelling error, it should be "Marlborough".
4. [GRAMMAR] - "There were no large towns, and the typical unit was the self-contained village, which included craftsmen as well as agriculturists, and especially workers in wool, the staple national industry." This sentence has a run-on quality with multiple clauses.
5. [SYNTAX] - "The typical village was a street of cottages, each with a small garden, and an open field round it, divided up like a modern allotments area." The sentence structure is awkward and the phrasing is unclear.
6. [SYNTAX] - "The roads between villages were mere tracks across the common, often so bad that carts were driven by preference through the fields, as they still are in Greece." The sentence is complex and the comparison to Greece is somewhat jarring in this context.
7. [GRAMMAR] - "This is the more remarkable, when we remember the manner in which young children were treated before the Factory Acts." The phrasing is awkward and the sentence structure is confusing.
8. [SYNTAX] - "Families like that of Dean Colet, who was one of twenty-two children, among whom he was the only one to grow up, remained common till the middle of the eighteenth century." This sentence is complex and the meaning is somewhat unclear.
9. [SYNTAX] - "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company, even though we may think in our heart of hearts that the benefit of the inspiration was not without serious drawbacks." The phrasing is awkward and the sentence is complex.
10. [SYNTAX] - "There is hardly a "Lion Comique," or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene, who would commit such an offence to-day, and against these lapses from taste Sir Joshua's acquaintance with the best minds of his day failed to save him." This sentence is extremely complex and difficult to follow.
11. [GRAMMAR] - "The astonishing progress in all measurable values which marked the first half of the reign produced a whole literature of complacency." The sentence structure is awkward.
12. [SYNTAX] - "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." This sentence is somewhat confusing in its phrasing.

Now, I'll analyze the text for coherence issues:

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] - The text jumps between different historical periods and topics with little transition or explanation. For example, it moves from the Victorian age to Louis XIV to the Industrial Revolution without clear connections.
2. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear overall structure. It begins with a philosophical discussion of historical change, then shifts to specific historical events, then to economic and social conditions, then to literary and cultural figures, and then to more philosophical discussions again.
3. [LOGIC] - There are some logical inconsistencies in the text. For example, it discusses the Victorian age as a period of progress, but then describes it as a period of social and economic hardship for the working class.
4. [TRANSITION] - The transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt and lack clear connections. For example, the text moves from a discussion of the Industrial Revolution to a description of Dr. Johnson with no clear transition.
5. [LOGIC] - The text sometimes presents contradictory information. For example, it states that the country was "a going concern" during the Victorian age, but also describes it as a time of "appalling difficulties" for the government.
6. [LOGIC] - There are some historical inconsistencies. For example, it mentions Louis XIV while discussing the Victorian age, which is historically anachronistic.
7. [CLARITY] - Some of the concepts and ideas presented are not clearly explained or contextualized for the reader.
8. [LOGIC] - The text sometimes presents cause-and-effect relationships without sufficient evidence or explanation.
9. [LOGIC] - The text sometimes presents historical events in a way that suggests a linear or deterministic progression of history, which may not be accurate.
10. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear thesis or central argument that ties all the different elements together.

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For fluency, I would rate this text a 3.5. It is generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways. There are several awkward sentence structures, complex phrasing, and some spelling issues that make the text harder to follow.

For coherence, I would rate this text a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. While some parts are understandable, the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort. The text jumps between different historical periods, topics, and ideas without clear transitions or connections, making it challenging to follow the author's argument or purpose.

Let me finalize my evaluation:

**Fluency Score:** 3.5
**Coherence Score:** 2.5
