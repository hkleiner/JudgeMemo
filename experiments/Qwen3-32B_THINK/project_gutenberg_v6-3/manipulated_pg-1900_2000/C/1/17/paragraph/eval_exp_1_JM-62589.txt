Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text for Fluency and Coherence using the provided criteria and scale. The user wants me to list issues under each category with appropriate labels and then assign scores between 1 and 5, including half-points. 

First, I'll tackle Fluency. The definition mentions grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to look for errors or awkwardness in these areas. Let me read through the text again.

Looking at the text, there are some instances of archaic language, like "’Tis a lie!" and "’tis not like I’d forget Jack." These aren't errors per se but might be considered in terms of fluency if they disrupt the flow. However, the story is set in the past, so this is likely intentional. 

Next, I check for grammatical issues. There's a sentence: "He became soon a painter strong enough..." which should be "He soon became a painter..." That's a syntax issue. Another example: "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise his own limitations..." The placement of "soon" is awkward. Also, "He became soon a painter strong enough..." – the correct order would be "He soon became a painter..." 

There's a run-on sentence in the middle: "The German Von Eicken found, in this tendency of all human movements to provoke violent reactions, the master key of history." This is a long sentence with a comma splice. It could be split into two sentences for better readability. 

Another example: "Bahá’u’lláh’s writings forbid the aggressive proselytism through which many religious messages have been widely promulgated." The structure is a bit complex, but it's grammatically correct. 

Spelling-wise, I notice "realise" instead of "realize" – that's British spelling, which is acceptable but might be a point if the text is using American English. However, the story seems to be using British English given the archaic language, so maybe that's intentional. 

Word choice: "He became soon a painter strong enough..." – "strong enough" is a bit awkward. Maybe "capable of realizing..." would be better, but that's a matter of style. 

Punctuation: There are some missing commas in dialogue. For example, "‘Tis a lie!’ screamed the girl, ‘he did not know when he promised.’" The comma after the first dialogue tag is missing. Also, some sentences are run-on and could benefit from periods or semicolons. 

Now, Coherence. The text tells a story of Debby losing her father and her struggle. The main issue here is whether the narrative flows logically and ideas are connected. 

The story starts with Debby's situation, then there's a sudden shift to discussing Reynolds, an artist. This seems out of place. The paragraph about Reynolds and the Royal Academy doesn't connect to the main narrative. This is a coherence issue because it disrupts the flow. 

Another shift is the paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh and the Bahá’í Faith. Again, this seems unrelated to the main story. These sections don't contribute to Debby's character or the plot, making the narrative disjointed. 

There's also a paragraph about Von Eicken and historical movements. This is another non-sequitur. The story jumps from Debby's personal struggles to abstract historical analysis, which breaks the narrative flow. 

The structure of the text has these random interjections that don't tie into the main plot. For example, the section about Reynolds is in the middle of Debby's story, then later the Bahá’í section. These transitions are abrupt and make the story confusing. 

The story does return to Debby's perspective after these interludes, but the lack of clear transitions makes it hard to follow. The coherence is affected because the reader is pulled away from the main narrative into unrelated topics. 

Now, assigning scores. For Fluency: The text has some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but overall it's readable. The errors are minor and don't severely disrupt reading. So maybe a 4. 

For Coherence: The main issue is the disjointed structure with unrelated paragraphs. The story has logical progression but is interrupted by non-sequiturs. This affects the overall coherence. So maybe a 3.5, as there are noticeable issues but the main narrative is still understandable.
