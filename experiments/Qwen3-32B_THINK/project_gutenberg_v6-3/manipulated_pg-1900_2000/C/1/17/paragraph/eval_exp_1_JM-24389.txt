Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **[GRAMMAR]** - "He was now set to work upon important designs for engravings." The verb "was set" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
2. **[SPELLING]** - "a musican" should be "a musician."
3. **[SYNTAX]** - "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised as well as we do..." This sentence is overly complex and hard to follow.
4. **[LEXICON]** - "He went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely setting his hand to anything that was wanted of him..." The phrase "setting his hand to anything that was wanted of him" is somewhat unclear.
5. **[PUNCTUATION]** - Missing commas in long sentences, such as "A musican knows that the laws of harmony and counterpoint are not fixed, that the musical horizon widens year by year..." which could be improved for readability.
6. **[SPELLING]** - "Bahá’u’lláh’s mission began in a subterranean dungeon in Teheran..." "Teheran" is the older spelling; the current common spelling is "Tehran."
7. **[GRAMMAR]** - "He had never even seen Herold; but, through lack of personal interest, and also because he needed somebody to look out for the property..." The semicolon usage here is incorrect and should be a comma.

### Coherence Issues:
1. **[LOGIC]** - The narrative abruptly shifts from Marche's conversation with the boy and his sister to a detailed historical account of Bahá’u’lláh and then to a discussion about progress in the first half of a reign. These sections are disjointed and do not logically connect to the main story.
2. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text transitions from a fictional narrative about Marche to an unrelated historical and analytical section without any clear transition or context, which disrupts the narrative flow.
3. **[CLARITY]** - The mention of Bahá’u’lláh and the discussion about progress are unclear in their relevance to the main story, making the text confusing for the reader.
4. **[TRANSITION]** - The transition from the fictional narrative to the historical and analytical sections is abrupt and lacks any connecting elements or foreshadowing, making the text feel fragmented.

### Final Scores:
- **Fluency Score**: The text has several grammatical errors, spelling issues, and complex sentences that affect readability. However, these issues are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand. I would rate this a 3.5.
- **Coherence Score**: The narrative is disrupted by unrelated sections that do not logically connect, leading to a fragmented reading experience. The abrupt transitions and lack of clear relevance between sections significantly impact coherence. I would rate this a 2.5.
