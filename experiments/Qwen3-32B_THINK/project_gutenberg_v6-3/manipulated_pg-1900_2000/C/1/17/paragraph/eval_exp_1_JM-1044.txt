Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency. The first thing I notice is the mix of different writing styles and topics. The text begins with a description of Bahá’u’lláh’s life, then transitions into a narrative about a comet and a captain, followed by a historical account of pre-Industrial Revolution England, and ends with a discussion about Sir Joshua Reynolds and art. This inconsistency in style could affect fluency.

Looking for grammar issues, there are a few instances where subject-verb agreement might be off. For example, "The country was on the whole prosperous and contented. The masses had no voice..." The transition between these sentences is abrupt. Also, there's a sentence fragment: "Yes, it was a mistake, Peters—that remark of mine." The em dash might be used correctly here, but it's a bit informal.

Punctuation issues include the use of em dashes without proper spacing or commas where needed. For example, "I found out, over there, that a kazark is exactly the bulk of a _hundred and sixty-nine worlds like ours_!" The em dash here might not be the best choice. Also, some sentences are run-ons, like the long dialogue sections with multiple exclamation points and interruptions.

Spelling seems okay, but there are some non-standard spellings like "b’fore" or "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" which might be archaic or stylistic choices. However, "b’fore" is a contraction that's not standard in formal writing. 

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases are archaic or overly complex, such as "He declined the ministerial career open to Him in government," which uses "Him" in a capital letter, possibly indicating a title or reverence, but might be confusing. Also, the use of "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" is metaphorical but might not be immediately clear to all readers.

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different narratives and time periods without clear transitions. The shift from the Bahá’u’lláh section to the comet story is abrupt. Then there's a sudden switch to the Industrial Revolution and then to Sir Joshua Reynolds. These shifts make it hard to follow a single thread.

The structure is disjointed. The comet story has a lot of dialogue and action, but it's unclear how it connects to the other sections. The mention of "Peters" in the dialogue is unclear—there's no context provided about who Peters is. This lack of context affects coherence.

Logical sequencing is an issue. The sections don't build on each other or lead naturally from one to the next. For example, after the comet story, the text moves to a historical account of England, which is unrelated to the previous narrative. The final section about Reynolds seems to come out of nowhere and doesn't connect to the earlier parts.

Clarity is affected by the inconsistent tone and style. The comet narrative is written in a first-person, adventurous style, while the historical and art sections are more academic. This inconsistency can confuse readers and make the text feel incoherent.

There are also some ambiguities. The term "kazark" is introduced without explanation, and the comet's actions (like heaving cargo overboard) are described in a way that's hard to visualize. The dialogue between the narrator and the clerk in the heaven scene is confusing because the context of why they're discussing San Francisco isn't clear.

Overall, the text has multiple sections that don't connect logically, abrupt transitions, and unclear references, which affect both fluency and coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transitions between unrelated topics (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh to comet narrative).  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., “The country *was*... The masses *had*...”).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation in dialogue (e.g., “I found out, over there, that a kazark is...”).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or unclear phrasing (e.g., “clothe her from stem to rudder-post”).  
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spellings (e.g., “b’fore” instead of “before”).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed shifts between narratives (e.g., comet story to Industrial Revolution).  
- [LOGIC] Illogical sequencing of unrelated sections (e.g., Reynolds’ art discourse after heaven scene).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., “Peters” and “kazark” without context).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitions between abrupt topic changes (e.g., from comet to village agriculture).  
- [CONTEXT] Ambiguous setting and character roles (e.g., who Peters is, why the clerk questions San Francisco).
