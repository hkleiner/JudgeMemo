Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is a chapter from what seems like a travelogue or ethnographic study of the Sarö Yögurs. First, I need to assess fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. The text has some inconsistencies in formatting. For example, the date is written as "December 13th 1907" without a comma, and there are missing commas after dates and locations. There are also some awkward phrasings, like "we soon left behind us the pleasant little Chinese town Chin-t'a" which could be smoother. The term "halfrounded" should probably be hyphenated as "half-rounded." The use of "ol which" instead of "of which" is a typo. Also, "K'ou-li (the territory inside the Great Wall) and K'ou-wai (the territory outside)" is a bit repetitive and could be rephrased for clarity. There are some run-on sentences that could be split for better readability. The transition from the main narrative to the section about Bahá’u’lláh seems abrupt and unrelated, which might be a coherence issue but also affects fluency. Overall, there are minor grammatical and punctuation issues, but the text is generally readable.

Moving on to coherence. The main question is whether the ideas flow logically and the narrative is structured clearly. The text starts with the expedition, describes the geography, then moves to the Yögur village, their customs, clothing, and so on. However, there's a sudden shift to a paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh and another about a young fellow in Lemoyne's studio, which seems out of place and unrelated to the rest of the text. This abrupt transition disrupts the coherence. Additionally, the paragraph about Sir Joshua Reynolds and the Royal Academy is also unrelated and doesn't fit the context of the Yögurs. These sections create confusion and break the logical flow. There are also some unclear transitions between different topics, like moving from clothing to handicrafts without clear connections. The overall structure is somewhat disjointed due to these unrelated sections, which affects the coherence of the narrative.

For fluency, the main issues are minor grammatical errors, missing punctuation, and some awkward phrasing. These don't severely impact readability but are noticeable. For coherence, the main problem is the inclusion of unrelated paragraphs that disrupt the flow and logical progression of the text. These sections don't contribute to the understanding of the Sarö Yögurs and create confusion. The rest of the text is generally coherent, but these disruptions lower the overall score.

Considering the scales, fluency would be a 4 because there are minor issues that don't significantly hinder understanding. Coherence would be a 3 because the text is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unrelated sections that affect the overall structure.
