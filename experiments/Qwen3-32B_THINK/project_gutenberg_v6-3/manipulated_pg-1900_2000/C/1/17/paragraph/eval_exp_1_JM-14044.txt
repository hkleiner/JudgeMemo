Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. First, I'll look at fluency. The text is a long essay, so I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure is complex but mostly correct. However, there are some instances of awkward phrasing. For example, "the river of civilisation reached a stretch of rapids towards the end of the eighteenth century" uses a metaphor that's a bit unclear. Also, "the fast sailing clippers had a short lease of life before steam was used for crossing the seas" has a mixed metaphor. 

There are some spelling issues. The word "dross" is spelled correctly, but "waggon" is an old variant; maybe "wagon" is more standard. The word "mediævalism" has a diacritic which might be a typo. Also, "livres" is French, so that's intentional, but "double-florins" is a bit confusing. 

In terms of grammar, the sentence "There was a thing happened about this time..." is incorrect. It should be "There was a thing that happened..." Also, "It was at about this period that variants of my tale began to be told as authentic histories." The phrase "at about this period" is redundant and awkward. 

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, the author starts discussing Reynolds and art, then moves to the 18th century's technological changes, then to a personal anecdote about a Sunday in August. The connection between these sections isn't clear. 

There's also a shift from discussing historical events to the author's personal experiences and then to the development of a story, which is confusing. The mention of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings in the middle of the text seems out of place and disrupts the flow. 

The text also has some inconsistencies. The author mentions the "Angels of Mons" legend but then shifts to discussing the story's creation and reception without clearly linking these parts. The structure is fragmented, making it hard to follow the narrative thread. 

In terms of clarity, some sentences are too long and convoluted. For example, "The musician, or the literary man, with very simple education may be able to achieve wonders, but the artist who looks to brushes and colours for his medium must sacrifice diligently for many years at the shrine of technique before his hand can express what is in his brain." This is a run-on sentence and hard to parse. 

There are also some logical issues. The author talks about the story's reception and then abruptly discusses Watteau and Boucher's art, which doesn't seem connected to the main topic. The transition between the journalist's perspective and the author's personal experiences is jarring. 

Overall, the text has several fluency issues with grammar and awkward phrasing, and coherence problems with structure and transitions. The score for fluency would be around 3 because of multiple issues, and coherence around 2.5 due to the disjointed structure and unclear connections between sections.

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect construction in "There was a thing happened..." (should be "There was a thing that happened..."). - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the river of civilisation reached a stretch of rapids..." (metaphor is unclear). - [LEXICON] Mixed metaphor in "the fast sailing clippers had a short lease of life before steam was used..." - [SPELLING] Use of archaic "waggon" instead of standard "wagon". - [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences in complex descriptions of 18th-century changes. - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences like "The musician, or the literary man, with very simple education may be able to achieve wonders..." - [SPELLING] Diacritic in "mediævalism" may be a typo.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between Reynolds' art, 18th-century history, personal anecdotes, and Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. - [LOGIC] Disconnected sections on art history, the "Angels of Mons" legend, and the author's creative process. - [TRANSITION] No clear links between the author's Sunday experience and the development of "The Bowmen". - [CLARITY] Confusing references to historical figures (Watteau, Boucher) without context. - [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of Bahá’u’lláh’s themes without connection to previous content. - [LOGIC] Inconsistent focus on the legend's evolution and the author's personal reflections.
