Alright, let me start by carefully reading the given text and evaluating it for fluency and coherence according to the provided criteria. 

### Fluency Assessment:

I'll look for issues related to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

**Detected Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "In the streets of Teheran, Western observers were appalled by scenes of Bábí victims blown from cannon mouths, hacked to death by axes and swords, and led to their deaths with burning candles inserted into open wounds in their bodies." - This is a very long sentence with multiple actions described in a complex manner that could be clearer and more grammatically structured.

2. [SYNTAX] "It was in these circumstances, and faced with the prospect of His own imminent death, that Bahá’u’lláh received the first intimation of His mission:" - The sentence structure is complex and could be clearer with proper punctuation or restructuring.

3. [SPELLING] "Teheran" - This appears to be a misspelling. The correct spelling is "Tehran."

4. [LEXICON] "He succeeded none the less in inscribing his name in modest yet precise characters--that will long remain legible--upon the marble of the temple." - The metaphor "precise characters" and "marble of the temple" is somewhat abstract and might not be the most effective word choice.

5. [PUNCTUATION] "The father of Meissonier was a dealer in colonial products and chemicals, and kept a drug and provision shop in the Rue des Ecouffes." - The sentence could use a comma after "chemicals" to separate the two independent clauses.

6. [GRAMMAR] "It should be remembered that, for some years previous, the question of painting in France had been taking on a rather bitter tone." - The phrase "for some years previous" is not typically used in this way; "for some years previously" would be more standard.

7. [SYNTAX] "The mere sight of a picture often takes our attention from our serious duties." - The phrasing is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

8. [GRAMMAR] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." - This sentence has a complex structure that could be clearer with proper punctuation and perhaps restructuring.

9. [GRAMMAR] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." - The phrasing is somewhat awkward and could be clearer.

10. [GRAMMAR] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." - This is a bit awkward; "He had to content himself with simply frequenting the Louvre" would be more natural.

### Coherence Assessment:

I'll look for issues related to logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, and how consistent and clear the narrative is.

**Detected Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a story about a military maneuver to a discussion about the Bábí victims in Tehran. This jump is confusing and lacks clear connection or transition.

2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is somewhat disjointed. The text begins with a specific anecdote about Meissonier observing a military maneuver, then shifts to a completely different topic about Bahá’u’lláh, and then returns to Meissonier's artistic philosophy.

3. [LOGIC] The discussion about Bahá’u’lláh and the Bábí victims seems out of place in a text about Meissonier. There's no clear connection established between these religious/political events and Meissonier's artistic philosophy.

4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are often abrupt. For example, the text moves from discussing Meissonier's early years to a discussion of Joshua Reynolds and Nicolas Boucher without clear transitional phrases.

5. [CLARITY] The text sometimes presents ideas in a convoluted manner. For example, the explanation of the French Revolution's impact on art is complex and not clearly connected to Meissonier's story.

6. [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from Meissonier's early life to a broader discussion about French art history, then back to Meissonier's personal story. This structure could be confusing for readers trying to follow a coherent narrative.

7. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new ideas or comparisons (like with Delacroix or Reynolds) that are not fully explained or integrated into the main narrative about Meissonier.

8. [LOGIC] The text discusses Meissonier's early years and then shifts to a discussion of the French Revolution and its impact on art, which is not clearly connected to Meissonier's personal development as an artist.

9. [LOGIC] The narrative occasionally includes tangential information (like the story about the Bábí victims in Tehran) that doesn't directly contribute to the understanding of Meissonier's life or art.

### Final Scores:

**Fluency Score:**
The text is generally well-written with clear and natural phrasing. There are a few grammatical and syntactic issues, as well as one spelling error, but these don't significantly disrupt the overall readability. Based on the scale, this would be a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with minor issues that don't distract from understanding.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has several coherence issues, including abrupt shifts in topic, out-of-place discussions, and a lack of clear transitions. These issues affect the logical flow and make the narrative less cohesive. Based on the scale, this would be a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.

Let me review my evaluation one more time to ensure accuracy:

For fluency, I identified 10 issues, most of which are minor and don't significantly disrupt the flow. The text is generally well-written.

For coherence, I identified 9 issues, including significant jumps in topic and unclear connections between ideas. These issues make the narrative less cohesive.

I believe my scores of 4.5 for fluency and 3.5 for coherence are accurate based on the evaluation criteria provided.

- [GRAMMAR] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." (complex structure needs restructuring)
