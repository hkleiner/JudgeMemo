Let me analyze the text to evaluate it for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll look for fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, punctuation):

1. There are some archaic or unusual phrasings that might affect fluency for modern readers:
   - "[T]he attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse"
   - "[T]he dark-eyed, long-nosed folk that trudged these steep and narrow thoroughfares were a sluggish people"

2. Some sentences are quite long and complex, which could make them less fluent:
   - "As the glovemaker looked out of his sombre house over the sunlit slopes of the grey-green olive-trees that stretched away to the deep blue waters of the sea, he vowed his child to commerce and a thrifty life in this far-away country place that was but little vexed with the high ambitions of distant, fickle, laughing Paris, or her splendid scandals; nay, scarce gave serious thought to her gadding fashions or her feverish vogues--indeed, the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse--as the worthy mercer was first in all the little town to know by his modest traffic in them; and that, too, only long after the things they shadowed were buried under new millineries and fopperies and fantastic riot in the gay capital."

3. There are some awkward transitions or phrasing:
   - "So it came about--'twas in that year of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the year that saw the Pompadour come to supreme power (she had been for three years the king's acknowledged mistress)--the youth's mother, with all a French mother's shrewdness and common-sense, gathered together the sixteen-year-old lad's sketches, and bundled off with him in a diligence to Paris."

4. There are some instances of inconsistent verb tense usage:
   - The text switches between past and present tense in some sections.

5. Some word choices seem unusual or might be considered archaic:
   - "He was prodigal in her encouragement of the arts"
   - "He idled his master into despair"

6. There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of dashes and semicolons.

Now for coherence issues (logical progression, connected ideas, clear structure):

1. The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions:
   - It moves from describing Fragonard's early life to a general discussion of 18th century international relations and then back to Fragonard's story.

2. There are some abrupt shifts in focus:
   - The text suddenly shifts to discussing Bahá’u’lláh's writings in the middle of a section about the Pompadour, with no clear connection or transition.

3. Some information seems out of place or disconnected from the main narrative:
   - The detailed explanation about tapestry production seems somewhat tangential to Fragonard's biography.

4. The text occasionally introduces new information without sufficient context:
   - The discussion about the Director-General of Buildings and the Pompadour's brother appears without much prior setup.

5. There are some inconsistencies in the narrative flow:
   - The text mentions the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in relation to Fragonard's life, but then later discusses the same treaty in a more general historical context.

6. Some sentences seem to be non-sequiturs or have unclear logical connections:
   - "The nations, weary of war, agreed to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. In this, our artist's sixteenth year, the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years."

Based on these observations, I'll now rate the text for fluency and coherence.

For fluency:
The text has some notable issues with archaic phrasing, complex sentence structures, and occasional awkward transitions. However, it's generally readable and the main message is clear. I would rate it as mostly fluent with some minor issues, so a score of 3.5 out of 5.

For coherence:
The text has several issues with logical progression and narrative flow. There are abrupt shifts in topic, some disconnected information, and a few non-sequiturs. However, the main narrative about Fragonard is generally coherent and the text maintains a biographical structure. I would rate it as mostly coherent with some noticeable issues, so a score of 3.5 out of 5.
