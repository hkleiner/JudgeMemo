Let me analyze this text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll look at fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "THE Pyreneean valley" - The word "THE" is capitalized unnecessarily.
- [GRAMMAR] "Tourists in search of good hotels and picturesque beauty combined, do not generally extend their journeys..." - This sentence has awkward phrasing with the placement of "combined."
- [GRAMMAR] "They rarely get beyond Luchon; and in this they are right..." - The semicolon usage is questionable here.
- [GRAMMAR] "as to become undesirous of further travel." - This phrase is somewhat awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "And probably they will remain so; for though there are among them lovely valleys..." - The semicolon usage is questionable.
- [GRAMMAR] "At the Port de Venasquez and the Brèche de Roland in the Western Pyrenees, or rather, to speak more truly..." - This sentence is convoluted.
- [GRAMMAR] "one can make comparisons with Switzerland, Northern Italy, the Tyrol, and Ireland, which will not be injurious to the scenes then under view." - This sentence is awkward and has a problematic relative clause.
- [GRAMMAR] "And then, as a natural consequence of all this, the hotels—are not quite as good as they should be." - The em dash is used in an awkward way.
- [GRAMMAR] "The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] "The years between 1749 and 1752, devoted by Reynolds to studying and copying the Vatican frescoes and the pictures of Padua, Milan, Turin, and Paris, were invaluable." - This sentence is very long and convoluted.
- [GRAMMAR] "Indeed he was one of the greatest copyists of his time, and Sir Walter Armstrong thinks that one of his copies of a Rembrandt is classed among the originals in the National Gallery to-day!" - The exclamation mark at the end is inappropriate for this type of text.
- [GRAMMAR] "The early nineteenth century was a period of messianic expectations in many lands." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] "In Europe and America groups like the Templers and the Millerites believed they had found in the Christian scriptures evidence supporting their conviction that history had ended and the return of Jesus Christ was at hand." - This sentence is very long and could be more clearly structured.
- [GRAMMAR] "A markedly similar ferment developed in the Middle East around the belief that the fulfillment of various prophecies in the Qur’án and Islamic Traditions was imminent." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] "The former caused a panic which now seems to us exaggerated." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] "They did not realise how different the conditions were in the two countries." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.
- [GRAMMAR] "The most modest democratic reforms were therefore impossible till Napoleon was out of the way, and till the anti-revolutionary panic had subsided." - This sentence is out of context and seems misplaced.

Now for coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text has several segments that seem completely out of place and unrelated to the main narrative about La Mère Bauche and Vernet. These include:
  - The section about Reynolds and his copies of artworks
  - The section about messianic expectations in the 19th century
  - The section about the French Revolution and its impact on reforms
- [LOGIC] The narrative about La Mère Bauche is interrupted by these unrelated historical passages, which disrupt the flow of the story.
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the main narrative about Vernet and the unrelated historical segments.
- [COHESION] The text lacks cohesion as it jumps between different topics and time periods without clear connections.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text shifts between different narrative perspectives and time periods without explanation.
- [CONTEXT] Several sentences appear in the wrong context, such as "The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs" which seems to refer to a different narrative entirely.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the text:

For fluency, there are multiple grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but the text is generally readable. I would give a score of 3.5.

For coherence, the text has significant issues with structure, logic, and cohesion due to the unrelated historical passages interrupting the main narrative. I would give a score of 2.5.
