Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to look for any issues in these areas.

The text is quite long and complex, with many sentences that are lengthy and contain intricate structures. Let me scan through for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "THEY cannot be separated any more than sheep and a shepherd..." - This seems fine. However, I notice that "THEY" is capitalized, which might be intentional if it's the start of a section, but it's not clear why it's capitalized otherwise. 

In the second paragraph: "It does not follow that one is a bookman because he has many books, for he may be a book huckster or his books may be those without which a gentlemanâ€™s library is not complete." The phrasing is complex but grammatically correct. 

Further on: "And in the present imperfect arrangement of life one may be a bookman and yet have very few books..." This sentence is a bit awkward, but it's still understandable. 

In the long anecdote about the dinner: "As he was to preside at a lecture I was delivering he had in his courtesy invited me to dinner..." The sentence is a bit long and could be clearer with a comma after "dinner," but it's still comprehensible. 

There are several instances of complex sentences that are well-constructed but could be clearer. For example: "Before I saw the doors I had no doubt about my host, but they were a seal upon my faith..." This sentence is grammatically correct but somewhat complex. 

There are also some instances of awkward phrasing, like "It has seemed to me as if certain old friends looked out from their prison with appealing glance..." The use of "appealing glance" is a bit unusual but not incorrect. 

I don't see any major spelling errors. The text is well-written with few grammatical issues. However, there are some complex sentences that might be slightly awkward or could be clearer. 

Now for coherence. Coherence is about logical progression, transitions, and overall structure. The text is a long essay about bookmen, with various anecdotes and references. Let me check for logical flow and transitions.

The text starts with a definition of a bookman, then moves to an anecdote about a dinner with a bookman, then shifts to another anecdote about a colonial squatter, then to Dr. Johnson, then to Boucher, and finally to the French Revolution and its impact. These shifts are abrupt and not well-connected. There's a lack of clear transitions between these different sections. 

For example, after the anecdote about the colonial squatter, the text suddenly moves to Dr. Johnson. There's no clear connection between these two sections. Similarly, the shift from Dr. Johnson to Boucher is also abrupt. 

The text also jumps from discussing the French Revolution to a description of prisoners being executed. This transition is not explained and seems disconnected from the rest of the text. 

The overall structure lacks a clear progression. Each section seems to be a separate idea or anecdote without a unifying thread. The reader is left to piece together the connections between these different parts. 

There are also some instances of repetition, such as the repeated use of "bookman" and "books" throughout the text. While this might be intentional for emphasis, it can make the text feel repetitive and less engaging. 

The conclusion about classic literature and the French Revolution seems disconnected from the earlier anecdotes and discussions about bookmen. The text ends with a description of prisoners being executed, which feels out of place and does not tie back to the main theme. 

In summary, while the text is well-written in terms of fluency, it suffers from a lack of coherence due to abrupt transitions, disconnected sections, and an overall lack of structure.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and convoluted sentence structures hinder readability.  
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous antecedents in long sentences (e.g., "he" referring to multiple possible subjects).  
- [LEXICON] Unconventional phrasing ("seal upon my faith," "appealing glance") creates minor confusion.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in compound sentences (e.g., "As he was to preside... he had in his courtesy invited me to dinner").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between unrelated anecdotes (e.g., colonial squatter to Dr. Johnson to Boucher).  
- [STRUCTURE] No clear progression or unifying theme connecting sections.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from French Revolution to prisoners being executed with no contextual link.  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive use of "bookman" and "books" without evolving the central argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
