Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

For fluency, I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues:

1. "a thing it naked and you stand face to face with the notion..." - This sentence has a grammatical error. It should be "a thing is naked..."
2. "the notion was not stripped too naked..." - This phrasing is awkward and should be "the notion was not stripped too bare..."
3. "the philosophy of nature is a Philosophy of Clothes" - Inconsistent capitalization of "Philosophy" in the middle of the sentence.
4. "a stuff, of Commerce, of Language..." - "a stuff" seems to be a typo for "a stuff" (possibly "a stuff" is a placeholder or typo for "a stuff" or "a stuff").
5. "the one in the many" - This is a common philosophical phrase but is a bit awkward in context.
6. "the magic of differentiation" - The use of "magic" here is a bit strange and creates an odd metaphor.
7. "the more heterogeneous the products--inorganic, organic, and superorganic, as I learnt to call them--the stronger the evidence for the law." - This sentence is quite long and complex, making it harder to follow.
8. "Only by shutting one's eyes to the light that had been shed on the world by evolution could one fail to see how simple and yet how inevitable was the whole business." - This sentence is awkwardly structured and the phrase "how simple and yet how inevitable was the whole business" is somewhat informal and out of place in an academic text.
9. "Thus we are led up to the statement of the all-pervading principle..." - The phrase "led up to" is a bit informal.
10. "It is this: Every active force produces more than one change--every cause produces more than one effect." - The repetition of "every" is somewhat redundant.
11. "The decomposition of every expended force into several forces has been perpetually producing a higher complication..." - This sentence is quite complex and the phrasing is awkward.
12. "In a brief third part we are bidden to remember that" - "biden" is a somewhat archaic and formal word that feels out of place in this context.
13. "The sincere man of science, content to follow wherever the evidence leads him becomes by each new enquiry more profoundly convinced..." - This sentence is missing a comma after "him" which makes it run-on.
14. "The story of evolution is the story of inter-related changes." - The hyphen in "inter-related" is inconsistent with the rest of the text.
15. "The thing, says James is a most vital and original piece of attitude-taking in the world of ideals." - This sentence is missing a comma after "James" and the word "thing" seems to refer to something not previously mentioned.
16. "It was his signal merit to work biological interpretation for all, and perhaps more than, it was worth." - The phrase "work biological interpretation for all" is awkward and unclear.
17. "It was on these lines that he was led to find a clue to those social and political developments, the discussion of which, in the Nonconformist of 1842, constituted the first step from the life of an engineer to that other kind of life which led to the elaboration of a thing." - This sentence is extremely long and complex, with multiple subordinate clauses that make it hard to follow.
18. "He was so obsessed with the paramount importance of biological relationships that in his Sociology, his Ethics, his Psychology, he failed to do justice to, or even to realize the presence of, other and higher relationships--higher, that is, in the evolutionary scale." - This sentence is very long and the repetition of "higher" is redundant.
19. "It was his firm and often inflexible 'attitude' which was a source of strength in Spencer, though it was the strength of rigidity rather than that of sinewy suppleness." - The phrase "the strength of rigidity rather than that of sinewy suppleness" is a bit awkward and the metaphor is somewhat unclear.
20. "He was so obsessed with the paramount importance of biological relationships that in his Sociology, his Ethics, his Psychology, he failed to do justice to, or even to realize the presence of, other and higher relationships--higher, that is, in the evolutionary scale." - This sentence is very long and the repetition of "higher" is redundant.
21. "It was his signal merit to work biological interpretation for all, and perhaps more than, it was worth." - The phrase "work biological interpretation for all" is awkward and unclear.
22. "He was so obsessed with the paramount importance of biological relationships that in his Sociology, his Ethics, his Psychology, he failed to do justice to, or even to realize the presence of, other and higher relationships--higher, that is, in the evolutionary scale." - This sentence is very long and the repetition of "higher" is redundant.
23. "But even here 'specifically stated, the problem is to interpret mental evolution in terms of the redistribution of matter and motion'." - The quotation is not properly formatted with quotation marks on both ends.
24. "It is true that the antithesis of subject and object is never to be transcended 'while consciousness lasts'." - The quotation is not properly formatted with quotation marks on both ends.
25. "We can think of Matter only in terms of Mind. We can think of Mind only in terms of Matter." - These two sentences are very similar and the repetition is somewhat redundant.

For coherence, I'll look for logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is:

1. The text jumps between personal recollections and more general philosophical discussions without clear transitions.
2. The narrative is somewhat disjointed, with the author moving between different topics (Spencer's philosophy, personal experiences, quotes from other works) without clear connections.
3. There are some abrupt shifts in perspective and focus, such as moving from a personal anecdote to a detailed philosophical discussion.
4. The text contains some repetition of ideas without clear progression or development.
5. Some quotes are introduced without proper context or explanation of their relevance.
6. The text sometimes presents complex philosophical ideas without sufficient explanation or context for the reader.
7. The flow of the argument is not always clear, with some ideas presented out of sequence or without proper introduction.
8. The text moves between different aspects of Spencer's philosophy without always making clear connections between them.
9. The final section contains a lot of abstract philosophical concepts without always connecting them back to the main narrative or argument.

Based on my analysis, I would rate the fluency and coherence as follows:

Fluency: I would give this a 3.5. The text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but it contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways. There are several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some confusing sentence structures that make reading the text more difficult than it should be.

Coherence: I would give this a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience. The narrative jumps between different topics and perspectives without always making clear connections, and some complex ideas are presented without sufficient explanation or context.
