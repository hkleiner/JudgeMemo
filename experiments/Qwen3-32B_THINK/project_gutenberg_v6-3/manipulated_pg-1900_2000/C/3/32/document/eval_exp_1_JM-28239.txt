Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**
I notice several problems with the text's fluency:
1. [LEXICON] The text repeatedly uses the word "stuff" in place of specific geographical names, which is clearly a placeholder or error.
2. [LEXICON] The text repeatedly uses the phrase "the thing" in place of specific geographical names, another placeholder or error.
3. [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues, such as missing articles ("In its eastern portion, constituting nearly one-third of its area") and incomplete sentences.
4. [SPELLING] There are some spelling inconsistencies, such as "Allegheny" vs. "Alleghenies" later in the text.
5. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or run on without proper punctuation.
6. [GRAMMAR] There are issues with subject-verb agreement and tense consistency in some places.

**Coherence Issues:**
I notice several problems with the text's coherence:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure as a historical narrative, but the use of "stuff" and "thing" throughout makes it difficult to follow the geographical context.
2. [LOGIC] The narrative has logical flow issues because of the missing geographical information.
3. [CLARITY] The text is confusing in places because of the repeated use of "stuff" and "thing" instead of specific names.
4. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions in some places.
5. [LOGIC] Some historical facts are presented without clear connections to the broader narrative.
6. [STRUCTURE] The narrative sometimes shifts between different locations and events without sufficient context.

Based on my assessment:

**Fluency Score:** The text has multiple issues with word choice (repeated use of "stuff" and "thing") and some grammatical errors. However, the core narrative is still readable and the language flows reasonably well despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 - it contains frequent issues that interrupt the flow and clarity, but is still generally understandable.

**Coherence Score:** The text has a clear narrative structure but is significantly hindered by the repeated use of "stuff" and "thing" instead of specific geographical names, making it difficult to follow the geographical context and understand the relationships between locations. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make understanding difficult without extra effort.
