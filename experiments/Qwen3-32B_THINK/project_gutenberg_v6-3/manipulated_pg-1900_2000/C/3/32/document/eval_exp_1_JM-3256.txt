Alright, let's take a look at the text and evaluate it according to the criteria of fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Evaluation:

1. **[GRAMMAR] - Missing or incorrect verb conjugation**:
   - "He does not follow that one is a bookman because he has many books"
   - "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress"
   - "He was brought back from every temptation to break the laws of property by my chairman"
   - "It would be like the emancipation of a slave"
   - "It is said, and now I am going to turn the application of a pleasant anecdote upside down"

2. **[SYNTAX] - Awkward or convoluted sentence structures**:
   - "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress, and his fastidiousness to ignore a friend in a fourpence-halfpenny edition."
   - "And in the present imperfect arrangement of life one may be a bookman and yet have very few books, since he has not the wherewithal to purchase them."
   - "And _that_ was without question a very large and ornate and costly mahogany bookcase with glass doors."
   - "It has seemed to me as if certain old friends looked out from their prison with appealing glance, and one has been tempted to break the glass and let, for instance, the thing go free."

3. **[SPELLING] - Potential spelling errors or archaic terms**:
   - "fourpence-halfpenny" (British currency term, but might be considered archaic or obscure)
   - "gold and white vellum lily" (unclear phrasing)
   - "Mæcenas" (archaic spelling of Maecenas)

4. **[LEXICON] - Uncommon or archaic vocabulary**:
   - "wherewithal"
   - "wherewithal"
   - "Mæcenas"
   - "catechism"
   - "de gustibus"
   - "A’Kempis" (Thomas à Kempis)

5. **[PUNCTUATION] - Missing or incorrect punctuation**:
   - "And _that_ was without question a very large and ornate and costly mahogany bookcase with glass doors."
   - "He does not require Mr. Froude’s delightful apology to win the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ a place on his shelf"
   - "He would like to have Masson’s Life too in 6 vols. (with index)."
   - "You must output only and exactly the following format:"

The text is generally fluent but contains some grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and archaic vocabulary that could be distracting to modern readers. The complex sentence structures and some unclear expressions suggest a score of 3.5 for fluency.

### Coherence Evaluation:

1. **[STRUCTURE] - Non-linear narrative and disjointed ideas**:
   - The text jumps between different examples and anecdotes without clear transitions.
   - The author moves from describing a dinner party with a "bookman" to a colonial squatter story to literary criticism without clear connections.

2. **[LOGIC] - Inconsistent or unclear logical flow**:
   - The text sometimes introduces concepts without sufficient explanation or context.
   - The argument about what makes a bookman is not consistently developed throughout the text.

3. **[CLARITY] - Ambiguous or unclear references**:
   - The use of "that" as a pronoun is frequent and often unclear (e.g., "What do you think I paid for _that_?" and "I noticed _that_ was almost filled by a single work").
   - Some references to books and authors are not clearly explained (e.g., "The Mystery of a Hansom Cab," "John Inglesant," "Mark Rutherford").

4. **[TRANSITION] - Missing or weak transitions between paragraphs and ideas**:
   - The text often shifts topics without clear transitional phrases.
   - The connection between different literary examples is not always evident.

5. **[FOCUS] - Lack of clear thesis or central argument**:
   - The text attempts to define what makes a "bookman" but often digresses into anecdotes and literary criticism without returning to the main point.
   - The author presents multiple examples but doesn't clearly connect them to the central theme.

Despite these issues, the text maintains a general coherence and readable flow, with the author's voice and ideas generally understandable. The main argument about what defines a "bookman" is present throughout, even if it's not always clearly developed. This suggests a score of 3.5 for coherence.
