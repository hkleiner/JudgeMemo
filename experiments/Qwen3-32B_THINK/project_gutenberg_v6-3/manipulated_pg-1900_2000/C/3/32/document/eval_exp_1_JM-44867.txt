Okay, I need to evaluate the given text based on the fluency and coherence criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand its content and structure.

The text is a philosophical essay discussing two contrasting types of mind: one focused on the past (legal/submissive) and the other on the future (creative/legislative). The author contrasts these types, their implications, and examples from morality, law, and public affairs. The language is formal and dense, with complex sentences and abstract concepts.

Starting with **Fluency**. The main aspects to check are grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll look for any errors or awkward phrasing that might disrupt the flow.

1. **Complex Sentences**: The text has very long sentences with multiple clauses, which might be confusing. For example, "The first of these two types of mind, and it is, I think, the predominant type, the type of the majority of living people, is that which seems scarcely to think of the future at all..." This is a run-on sentence with several commas but no periods, which could affect readability.

2. **Word Choice and Repetition**: The author uses words like "predominant," "abundant," "submissive," "creative," etc., which are appropriate, but there's some repetition, like "the future" and "the past" repeated for emphasis. However, repetition here might be intentional for rhetorical effect.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: I notice some passive constructions and complex noun phrases. For example, "the relative importance they attach and the relative amount of thought they give to the future." The structure here is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct.

4. **Punctuation**: The text uses commas effectively, but the long sentences might benefit from periods or semicolons to break them up. For example, "The former type of mind, when one gets it in its purity, is retrospective in habit, and it interprets the things of the present, and gives value to this and denies it to that, entirely with relation to the past." The commas here are used correctly, but the sentence is quite long.

5. **Spelling**: I don't see any obvious spelling errors. Words like "Ã¦sthetic" (with the ligature) are correctly spelled in the context of the text's style.

6. **Phrasing and Flow**: The phrasing is mostly clear, but the dense and formal language might be a bit stiff. For example, "The legal mind says we are here because things have yet to be." This is clear, but the overall style is more academic and might not be as fluid as a more casual text.

**Fluency Issues Summary**:
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences that may be difficult to follow.
- [STRUCTURE] Overuse of commas without breaking sentences into shorter ones.
- [LEXICON] Some abstract and dense language that might hinder fluency for some readers.

Now, moving to **Coherence**. This involves checking the logical flow, transitions between ideas, clarity, and overall structure.

1. **Logical Flow**: The text introduces the two types of mind and then explores their implications in various areas like morality, law, and public affairs. The flow is generally logical, moving from introduction to examples and then to the implications of the conflict between these types.

2. **Transitions**: The author uses transitional phrases like "Now I do not wish to suggest," "But before pointing out," and "I suppose that three hundred years ago..." These help in connecting different parts of the argument.

3. **Clarity**: The concepts are abstract and might be challenging for some readers, but the author does a good job of explaining them. For example, the contrast between the legal and creative minds is maintained throughout the text.

4. **Structure**: The text is structured with an introduction of the two types, followed by examples and arguments. However, some sections might be a bit dense, such as the discussion on morality and promises, which could be clearer with more concrete examples.

5. **Ambiguities**: There are a few points where the argument might be ambiguous. For example, the line "the crown of a stuff" seems like a typo or misstatement, possibly intending "the crown of a country" or similar. This could confuse the reader.

6. **Consistency**: The author consistently contrasts the two types of mind, maintaining the focus on their differences and the consequences of their conflict. However, the shift from moral to public affairs could be smoother.

**Coherence Issues Summary**:
- [LOGIC] Some sections could benefit from clearer transitions, especially when moving between different examples (e.g., from morality to public affairs).
- [CLARITY] Abstract concepts and dense language may make some parts less accessible.
- [STRUCTURE] The long, complex sentences and paragraphs might disrupt the flow of ideas.
- [AMBIGUITY] Potential ambiguity in phrases like "the crown of a stuff" could confuse readers.

**Final Scores**:

For **Fluency**, the text is mostly fluent with some issues in syntax and structure. The long sentences and complex phrasing may affect readability, but the errors are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand. I would give a 3.5 because while the text is generally readable, the complexity and structure issues are noticeable and could be improved.

For **Coherence**, the text is logically structured with a clear progression of ideas, but there are some transitions and clarity issues that could be better. The main ideas are coherent, but some parts might be confusing due to abstract language and structure. I would give a 4.0, as the overall coherence is strong, with only minor issues that don't significantly disrupt understanding.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with excessive commas and lack of sentence breaks.
- [STRUCTURE] Overly convoluted phrasing in abstract concepts (e.g., "the relative importance they attach and the relative amount of thought they give to the future").
- [LEXICON] Dense academic language and repetitive phrasing ("the future" repeated for emphasis) may hinder natural flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between moral philosophy and historical examples (e.g., Plantagenet wars) with minimal transitional context.
- [CLARITY] Abstract concepts (e.g., "the crown of a stuff") lack sufficient explanation for clarity.
- [STRUCTURE] Paragraphs become excessively long, making logical progression harder to follow.
- [AMBIGUITY] Ambiguous phrasing like "the crown of a stuff" creates confusion without contextual clarification.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
