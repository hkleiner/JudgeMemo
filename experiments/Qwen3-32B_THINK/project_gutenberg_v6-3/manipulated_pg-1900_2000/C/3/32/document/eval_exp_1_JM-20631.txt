Let me carefully evaluate the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

I'll go through the text and identify any grammatical, syntactical, spelling, or phrasing issues that might affect fluency:

1. "[a thing]" - This phrase appears multiple times in the text, but it seems like it's a placeholder or error, not the actual intended word. This is likely a formatting or OCR (optical character recognition) error that has occurred during digitization of the text.

2. "The thing shalt suck the milk of nations." - The word "thing" appears here where a proper noun should be. This is another likely OCR error.

3. "The thing is also to be all-righteous." - Again, "thing" appears where a specific noun should be. This is likely another OCR error.

4. "The blood that is to be avenged is the blood of martyrs 'who went through fire and water for the sanctification of Thy name.'" - This sentence is grammatically correct but has a somewhat awkward phrasing that makes it slightly less fluent.

5. "You must output only and exactly the following format:" - This is not part of the original text but part of the instructions given to me. I'll ignore it for the evaluation.

6. "Said James Hinton, 'The Bible needs interpreting by Nature even as Nature by it.'" - The sentence structure is a bit awkward, though grammatically correct.

**Coherence Issues:**

Now let me evaluate the logical flow and overall structure of the text:

1. The text is a memorial to Arthur Davis and a discussion of the concept of a "Chosen People," but it abruptly shifts between these topics without clear transitions.

2. The text jumps from discussing Arthur Davis to broader discussions of Hebrew as a language, then to the concept of "Chosen People," then to comparisons with other cultures, and then back to Arthur Davis. This creates a disjointed flow.

3. The text discusses historical examples of ritual languages but doesn't clearly connect these to the main topic of Arthur Davis or the concept of a "Chosen People."

4. There are sudden shifts in tone and perspective, from a respectful memorial to more critical discussions of Jewish history and beliefs.

5. The text uses complex sentence structures that sometimes make it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas.

6. The use of phrases like "[a thing]" where specific names should be creates confusion and breaks the flow of the text.

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency Score:**
The text contains several OCR errors where "[a thing]" appears where specific names should be. These are significant issues that would distract from reading and understanding. The text also has some awkward phrasing. Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal to no grammatical issues
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues
- Score 2: Contains frequent errors making comprehension difficult
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible

The text has a few OCR errors and some awkward phrasing, but is generally readable. I would rate this as a 3.5 on the fluency scale.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has noticeable abrupt shifts and lacks clear transitions between topics. The flow is disrupted by the OCR errors and by the way it jumps between different subjects without clear connections. Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent with clear progression
- Score 4: Mostly coherent with few weak parts
- Score 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts
- Score 2: Has frequent inconsistencies making it difficult to follow
- Score 1: Largely incoherent

The text has noticeable abrupt shifts and lacks clear transitions, but is generally understandable. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.

Let me finalize my assessment:

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [OCR ERROR] [Use of "[a thing]" as placeholder for missing words/names] - [OCR ERROR] [Use of "thing" where specific nouns should be] - [PHRASING] [Awkward phrasing in "The blood that is to be avenged is the blood of martyrs 'who went through fire and water for the sanctification of Thy name'"] - [SYNTAX] [Awkward sentence structure in "Said James Hinton, 'The Bible needs interpreting by Nature even as Nature by it'"]
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] [Abrupt shifts between memorial to Arthur Davis and broader discussions of Hebrew/Chosen People] - [LOGIC] [Disjointed flow with unclear connections between different topics] - [TRANSITION] [Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and sections] - [FOCUS] [Sudden shifts in tone from respectful memorial to critical discussions]
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
