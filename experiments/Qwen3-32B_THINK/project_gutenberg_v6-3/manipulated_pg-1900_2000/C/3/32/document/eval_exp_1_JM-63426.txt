Okay, let's start by reading through the text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate fluency and coherence using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. I need to identify issues in each category and then assign scores.

First, for fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling mistakes, or issues with punctuation. The text seems to be a biographical account of Will Bradley. I notice some parts where the sentences are a bit run-on or have awkward structures. For example, in the first chapter, there's a sentence that says, "It was Bradley in the stuff who made the American public stir in its sleep..." The phrase "in the stuff" seems out of place and might be a placeholder or a typo. Also, there are some instances where the syntax is a bit confusing. For example, "Toulouse-Lautrec spreading modern art in the kiosks of the thing when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, a thing; barriers being demolished everywhere." The use of "a thing" here is unclear and might be a placeholder. There are also some missing punctuation marks, like the sentence ending with a semicolon instead of a period. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." The phrase "didn’t work" is a bit abrupt and might be better phrased as "it didn’t turn out that way." There are also some missing articles or prepositions that make the sentences feel incomplete. For example, "the advertising of such houses as the thing" – "the thing" seems to be a placeholder. These issues might affect the fluency of the text, making it a bit harder to read smoothly.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text starts with an introduction and then moves into a narrative about Bradley's early life. However, there are some abrupt shifts in the narrative. For example, the transition from the introduction to the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter is a bit sudden. The text jumps from discussing Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to his childhood in Ishpeming. There are also some unclear references, such as "the stuff" which appears multiple times without explanation. These instances of "the stuff" make the text confusing because the reader is left wondering what is being referred to. Additionally, the narrative structure could be more organized. The text moves through different phases of Bradley's life, but some parts feel disjointed. For instance, the section about the Iron Ore print shop and the encounter with the faker is a detailed story, but it's not clearly connected to the broader narrative of Bradley's career. The use of phrases like "the stuff" without context disrupts the coherence. There are also some missing transitions between paragraphs, which makes the flow of ideas less smooth. For example, the transition from Bradley's early work to his later career is a bit abrupt. The text also has some repetitive elements, such as the repeated mentions of "the stuff," which could be consolidated for better clarity. Overall, the text has a clear progression in terms of Bradley's life events, but the presence of unresolved references and abrupt shifts affects the overall coherence.

For the fluency score, considering the issues mentioned, the text has several grammatical and syntactical errors, some awkward phrasing, and instances of unclear or placeholder words. However, the majority of the text is readable, and the errors don't completely hinder understanding. I would rate this as a 3, as there are multiple issues that interrupt the flow and clarity.

For coherence, the text has some logical progression but suffers from unclear references, abrupt shifts, and disjointed sections. The repeated use of "the stuff" without explanation is a significant issue. The score here would be around 3 as well, as the coherence is generally there but marred by these issues.
