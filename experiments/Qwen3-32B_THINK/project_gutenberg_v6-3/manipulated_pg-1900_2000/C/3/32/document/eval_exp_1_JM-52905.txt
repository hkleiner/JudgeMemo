Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency looks at how smooth and easy the text is to read, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. I'll scan through the text to identify any issues that might affect fluency.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "stuff" is used in "behind the stuff" which doesn't make sense in context. It should probably be "bush" or another noun. There's also "a thing" and "Bushytail" which might be a typo or unclear reference. 

Next, there are some grammatical issues. The phrase "Now everybody don’t get scared" uses "don’t" with "everybody," which is incorrect. It should be "doesn’t." There's also a sentence fragment: "You can thank me that Danny Fox didn’t get in your house," which is missing a subject or verb.

In terms of syntax and structure, some sentences are awkwardly constructed. For example, "He didn’t want the Farmer’s Boy to hear him. “Never fear, my dear. I’ve rolled a great big stone against the front door. Old Sic’em is all bark." The transition between these sentences is abrupt. Also, "At the same time, it’s not very pleasant to have enemies so close to the house. Where are Slyboots and Bushytail?" The connection between these sentences is unclear.

Word choice issues include "a stuff was empty" which should probably be "the den was empty." Also, "along a stuff" is unclear and likely a typo. 

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence assesses how well the story flows and how logically the ideas are connected. 

The narrative structure seems mostly logical, but there are some inconsistencies. For example, the transition between chapters is abrupt, and some plot points are introduced without sufficient explanation. The character "a thing" is mentioned without clarification, which might confuse readers. 

There are also some unclear transitions. For instance, the shift from Danny Fox's escape to the Farmer's Boy's actions is a bit jarring. Additionally, some events are introduced suddenly without proper setup, like the Farmer's Boy finding the den empty without prior indication that the foxes had left.

The story has a clear progression, but there are a few instances where the cause-and-effect relationships are not clearly explained. For example, how Danny Fox loses his tail isn't clearly connected to the previous events. Also, the introduction of the Kind Willow Tree chapter seems a bit out of place in the overall narrative flow.

In terms of logical sequencing, some parts are disjointed. The mention of "Slyboots" and "Bushytail" without prior introduction can confuse readers. Also, the shift in time when returning to Little Jack Rabbit and Old Sic’em in the Willow Tree chapter is a bit abrupt.

Overall, the fluency issues are mostly minor but affect readability. The coherence issues are more about the narrative flow and transitions between events, which can make the story a bit confusing at times. I'll now assign scores based on these observations.
