Let me evaluate the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues**:
- [GRAMMAR] "It would have made me unpopular to have said so, even if I had had any designs in that direction." - This is grammatically awkward with multiple "had" verbs.
- [GRAMMAR] "My college mates, who were planning to be lawyers, engineers, or commercial men of prominence, considered teaching creditable only as a 'fill in job.'" - Missing apostrophe in "fill in job."
- [GRAMMAR] "I must not accept just a mere job, and to escape that humiliation I became a teacher." - The conjunction "and" is awkward here.
- [GRAMMAR] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession." - Awkward phrasing and structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "One man had made school teaching a job; the other had made it a profession." - Semicolon usage is awkward here.
- [GRAMMAR] "I was forced to stop over in a small town for about two hours, in order to make connection with the train that would take me to my destination." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "I noticed that the front door was open, and entered the building." - Missing conjunction between the two independent clauses.
- [GRAMMAR] "When I was elected here a year ago, the president of the board told me they had been unfortunate for years in securing a satisfactory fifth and sixth grade teacher." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "It was quite evident, as we went from room to room, that he had put the lesson into practice." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "I shall never forget that young man. Three years later he was at the head of one of the largest consolidated high schools in the state, and when I met him at the meeting of the thing in Detroit in 1916 he told me..." - "the meeting of the thing" is unclear and awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted in the field of education." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "Specializing in one or more subjects based upon a fragmentary educational foundation is the cause of many failures in the teaching profession." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "In reading applications I have often noticed statements of this character given by one of the references: 'Mr. ---- is good in his particular subject, but his use of English is so bad that I cannot recommend him for a position where he comes in contact daily with young people.'" - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "A teacher, however, should never cease to utilize every opportunity of broadening his general education." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "Not long ago a young man came to see me about a promotion. I asked him in what line of work he was best fitted for advancement." - Awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "It was interesting to note his idea of the teaching profession as contrasted with that of a young woman who had interviewed me a short time before concerning a possible opening in one of the high schools." - Awkward phrasing.

**Coherence Issues**:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the author's personal experience to the experiences of two other individuals without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes lacks clear cause-and-effect relationships between events and observations.
- [LOGIC] The text moves back and forth in time without clear indicators of when events are occurring.
- [LOGIC] The transition between the two young men's stories is abrupt and lacks clear connection.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents observations without clear context or explanation of their significance.
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about the two young men is somewhat abrupt and lacks development of the contrast between them.
- [LOGIC] The transition from the two young men's stories to the general advice about getting a teaching position is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents multiple ideas without clearly connecting them or showing how they relate.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes lacks a clear central theme or focus, jumping between different aspects of teaching.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents general advice without clearly connecting it to the specific examples provided.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

**Fluency Score**:
The text has multiple grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but these are generally minor and do not severely disrupt readability. The text is mostly fluent and well-structured with only occasional issues. I would rate this as a 4.

**Coherence Score**:
The text has some issues with logical flow and transitions between ideas. While the overall narrative is generally coherent, there are noticeable abrupt shifts and disconnected parts. I would rate this as a 3.5.
