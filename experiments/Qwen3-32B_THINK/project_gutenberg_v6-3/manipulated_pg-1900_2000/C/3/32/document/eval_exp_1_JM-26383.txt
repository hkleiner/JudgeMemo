Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues, and then provide the appropriate scores.

# Fluency Issues

Looking at the text, I can identify several fluency problems:

1. [GRAMMAR] - "The poetess was born at the thing in a thing" - This is grammatically incorrect and confusing. The word "thing" is used twice where specific locations should be mentioned.

2. [GRAMMAR] - "The thing, the Venus of Gothic creation, as now existing, was built piecemeal during the 13th and early part of 14th centuries." - This sentence is awkwardly constructed with unclear references.

3. [GRAMMAR] - "He once said, "My master whipt me very well." - The verb "whipt" is an archaic form that may not be familiar to all readers, though it is technically correct.

4. [GRAMMAR] - "The body of the palace is, however, to this day little changed from its state when inhabited by the Sewards." - The placement of "however" is awkward and disrupts the flow.

5. [LEXICON] - Repeated use of the word "thing" in various contexts where specific names should be (e.g., "the stuff," "a thing," etc.) - This is a major issue that makes the text confusing and difficult to follow.

6. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence structure is awkward and could be more concise.

7. [SYNTAX] - "He writes, "How am I honoured in Mr. and Mrs. Seward’s attachment to me!" - The punctuation is incorrect, with a comma used instead of a colon or dash.

8. [SYNTAX] - "The bier was decorated with garlands and flowers, as it was transported to the ship." - The sentence is awkwardly structured and could be more concise.

9. [SPELLING] - "whipt" - While not technically incorrect (it's an older form of "whipped"), it may be unfamiliar to modern readers and could be considered a spelling issue.

10. [SPELLING] - "trebly absurd" - This is an archaic form of "triply absurd" that may be confusing to some readers.

11. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

12. [SYNTAX] - "He writes, "How am I honoured in Mr. and Mrs. Seward’s attachment to me!" - The sentence structure is awkward.

13. [SYNTAX] - "A reference to "Notes and Queries," in the Sixth and Eighth Series, will show an inquirer that later search throws some doubt on such derivation." - The sentence is unnecessarily complex and awkward.

14. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

15. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

16. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

17. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

18. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

19. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

20. [SYNTAX] - "The derivation of the word "Lichfield" has excited a good deal of controversy." - The sentence is awkwardly constructed.

The most significant fluency issue is the repeated use of "the thing," "a thing," and "a stuff" where specific names should be. This is a major problem that severely impacts readability and understanding.

# Coherence Issues

Looking at the text for coherence problems:

1. [LOGIC] - The text frequently jumps between topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.

2. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear structure and organization. It appears to be a collection of facts and anecdotes without a cohesive narrative thread.

3. [CLARITY] - The repeated use of "the thing," "a thing," and "a stuff" where specific names should be creates confusion and reduces clarity.

4. [LOGIC] - The text often introduces new topics without clear connections to the previous content, making it difficult to follow the logical progression.

5. [TRANSITION] - The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it feel disjointed and fragmented.

6. [LOGIC] - The text sometimes presents information in a non-chronological or non-logical order, making it difficult to follow the narrative.

7. [CLARITY] - The text frequently mentions people and events without sufficient context, making it difficult for readers to understand the relationships between characters and events.

8. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, making it difficult to identify the main points and purpose of the writing.

9. [LOGIC] - The text sometimes presents contradictory or confusing information without clarification.

The most significant coherence issue is the lack of clear organization and structure, combined with the confusing use of "the thing" and "a stuff" where specific names should be.

# Final Scores

Based on my analysis:

For Fluency:
- The text has significant fluency issues, particularly with the repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" where specific names should be.
- There are also issues with grammar, syntax, and some spelling/word choice.
- The text is generally readable, but the repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" severely impacts fluency and readability.

Given these considerations, I would rate the fluency as a 2.5. The text is partially readable but has enough issues (especially with the repeated use of "the thing") that comprehension is often difficult.

For Coherence:
- The text lacks clear structure and organization.
- The repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" creates confusion and reduces coherence.
- The text jumps between topics without clear transitions.
- The logical progression is often unclear.

Given these considerations, I would rate the coherence as a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas, but some parts are understandable.

Let me finalize my evaluation:
