Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The user wants me to look for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious errors. The title is in all caps and hyphenated, which might be stylistic but not a problem. The first paragraph has a sentence that starts with "From the women of China I have learned..." – that's correct. However, there's a part that says "it is as accurate as she with her small store of the English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it." The phrase "small store of the English words" seems a bit awkward. Maybe "small store of English words" without "the" would be better. Also, the structure "she with her... and I with my..." could be smoother. 

Looking further, there's a line: "Turning off from the Da Mou Lui or the stuff, the name common to the main street..." Here, "the stuff" is unclear. It seems like a typo or a misused word. Maybe it should be "the name" again, or perhaps "the stuff" is a mistranslation. That's a problem.

Another part: "the bases of buildings and the grasses that had ventured up through the paving stones were worn away only in a central path..." The phrase "had ventured up" is a bit odd. Maybe "had grown up" would be better. 

In the paragraph about Kuei Ping's mother and the relative, the sentence structure is a bit long but not necessarily incorrect. However, "as if to agree that they were not worthy of attention" – the "as if to agree" part is a bit awkward. 

In the section where Madame Yen and Wong Lui are bargaining, there's a sentence that starts with "Kuei Ping, resting her eyes upon the pearls..." which is okay, but the flow is a bit choppy. 

Looking for spelling errors, I don't see any obvious ones. Punctuation seems mostly correct, though some sentences are quite long and could use commas for clarity. For example, "Wong Lui had noted that also and put it down in his favor in the game before them." The comma after "that also" might be missing, but it's not a critical error. 

Overall, the text is mostly fluent but has some awkward phrasing and minor grammatical issues that slightly affect readability. I would rate fluency as a 4 because there are some minor issues but the text is still mostly clear and readable.

Now for coherence. The story needs to have a logical progression, smooth transitions, and avoid abrupt shifts. The narrative starts with the dedication, then describes the Street of Precious Pearls, followed by the procession of Kuei Ping and her family. There's a flashback to her time at the mission school and her internal conflict about freedom versus family duty. 

The transition into the flashback is a bit abrupt. The sentence "With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically, Kuei Ping was back in memory..." is a bit jarring. It might be better to have a smoother transition to the flashback. 

The story does connect ideas, but the shift from the jewel-buying scene to the memory might confuse some readers. The internal conflict is presented clearly, but the connection between the pearls and her memories could be more explicit. 

The ending wraps up the scene at the shop but leaves some threads hanging, like the resolution of her internal conflict. However, the story is a slice of life, so that might be intentional. 

There are some moments where the narrative could be clearer, like the mention of "the stuff" which is confusing. Also, the mention of "the latter had been a trifle curt" refers to Miss Porter's response, but it's not entirely clear without prior context. 

Overall, the story is coherent with a clear progression, but there are a few points where transitions could be smoother and some minor confusion in certain parts. I would rate coherence as a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few areas that could be improved.
