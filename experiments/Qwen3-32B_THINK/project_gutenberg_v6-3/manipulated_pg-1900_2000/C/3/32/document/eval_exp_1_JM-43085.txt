Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] "in the neighbourhood of a thing" - This phrase doesn't make sense and appears to be a grammatical error.
2. [SPELLING] There are several instances of "the stuff" and "a stuff" which likely represent missing words or names.
3. [SPELLING] "the thing" appears multiple times in the text where specific words should be.
4. [SPELLING] "the thing catalogue" - "thing" is used where a specific name/catalogue title should be.
5. [SPELLING] "the thing." - This appears at the end of a sentence where a specific name should be.
6. [SPELLING] "the thing." - This appears in the sentence "in company with his friend Trimolet, a needy artist who succumbed to poverty before his real talent had had time to ripen, he obtained an opportunity to decorate fans. Then, some religious figures and emblems of saints for certain publishers in the Rue Saint-Jacques. This meant the assurance of an honest living; they could go to a restaurant twice a day, every day in the week, and proudly pass the paint-shop knowing their account was paid."

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The text references missing information ("a thing," "the stuff") that creates confusion about what is being discussed.
2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative flow is sometimes disrupted by the missing words, making it difficult to follow the story.
3. [CLARITY] The references to "the thing" and "a stuff" make it hard to understand what specific objects, places, or people are being referred to.
4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas and paragraphs are generally smooth, but the missing information sometimes creates abrupt shifts in understanding.
5. [LOGIC] The narrative about Meissonier's early career has some logical gaps due to the missing information, making it difficult to fully understand the chronology and context of events.

Now, let me assign scores based on these observations:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several significant issues with grammar, spelling, and word choice that would distract from reading and understanding. These are not just minor issues but rather ones that significantly affect the flow and readability of the text. I would rate this a 2 on the scale. The text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure that makes comprehension difficult.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has some issues with coherence due to the missing information and confusing references. However, the overall narrative about Meissonier's life and artistic philosophy is generally logical and well-structured. The story does have some logical gaps and confusion points, but the core narrative remains understandable. I would rate this a 3 on the scale. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me double-check my analysis:

**Fluency Issues:**
- The text contains numerous grammatical errors, most notably the repeated use of "a thing" and "the stuff" where specific words should be.
- These errors would significantly distract from reading and understanding.
- The text has awkward phrasing in several places that would make reading difficult.

**Coherence Issues:**
- The missing information creates logical gaps in the narrative.
- The confusing references make it hard to follow the story in some places.
- However, the overall narrative about Meissonier's life and artistic philosophy is generally logical and well-structured.
- The text has a clear progression from one section to another, despite the missing information.

I believe my scores are appropriate based on the evaluation criteria.
