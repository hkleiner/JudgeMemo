Let me evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll identify fluency issues in the text:

[GRAMMAR] "A stuff began by renouncing the world, and became the heir of the defunct Roman empire." - "A stuff" is likely a typo for "A sect" or "A certain group."
[LEXICON] "The French monarchy was stricken with mortal disease before Louis XV bequeathed his kingdom to his luckless successor." - "Stricken with mortal disease" is a metaphorical expression that might be confusing for some readers.
[GRAMMAR] "The reign of Queen Victoria, which I have chosen to mark the limits of my survey to-day, covered the latter half of this saeculum mirabile, the most wonderful century in human history." - The phrase "mark the limits of my survey to-day" is awkwardly phrased.
[GRAMMAR] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." - The sentence structure is slightly awkward.
[GRAMMAR] "The eighteenth century had been international; there was no Chauvinism or Jingoism anywhere till the French, fighting ostensibly under the banner of humanity, had kindled the fire of patriotism in a thing, in Germany, and even in the thing." - This sentence is confusing and contains multiple issues.
[GRAMMAR] "England had always had a strong national self-consciousness; and after the war the bonds of sympathy with a stuff were not at once renewed, so that our country, during the early part of the thing's reign, was more isolated from the main currents of European thought than ever before or since." - This sentence is confusing with multiple instances of "a thing" and "the thing."
[GRAMMAR] "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." - The second sentence is abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the first.
[GRAMMAR] "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." - The phrase "a going concern" is an idiom that may be confusing to some readers.

Now, for coherence issues:

[LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics (history, economics, social conditions) without clear transitions.
[STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, making it difficult to follow the author's argument or narrative.
[LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient supporting evidence or explanation.
[CLARITY] The text contains several confusing or ambiguous statements that make it hard to understand the author's point.
[LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory or inconsistent ideas.
[LOGIC] The text often makes broad historical claims without providing specific examples or context.
[LOGIC] The author frequently makes assumptions about the reader's knowledge without explanation.
[LOGIC] The text sometimes presents cause-and-effect relationships without sufficient evidence.

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores:

For fluency, the text has several grammatical and lexical issues that affect readability, but the overall text is still understandable. The problems are not so severe as to make the text difficult to follow, but they are noticeable. I would rate the fluency as a 3.5.

For coherence, the text has significant issues with logical flow and structure. The author jumps between topics without clear transitions, and the organization is not well defined. The arguments are often presented without sufficient context or explanation. While there are some coherent sections, the overall coherence is significantly impacted by these issues. I would rate the coherence as a 2.5.
