Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user wants me to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious errors. I notice a few instances where words might be missing or sentences are awkward. For example, in the line "In a thing. They had been in love two months," the word "thing" seems out of place and might be a typo or a missing word. It should probably be "In a town" or something similar.

There's also a sentence that reads: "It was now May: they were to be married at last." The colon here is correct, but maybe a semicolon would be better for clarity. Not a major issue, though.

Another spot is "It's a long, long time," she said, without knowing what she was saying." The comma after "saying" might be better as a period to end the sentence properly. Also, the phrase "without knowing what she was saying" is a bit unclear. Maybe "without knowing what she was saying" is correct, but the structure could be smoother.

Looking for spelling errors, I don't see any obvious ones. Words like "palsied" and "crooked" are spelled correctly. The use of British English terms like "veil" and "station" is consistent, so that's fine.

In terms of syntax, some sentences are a bit long and could be broken up for better readability. For example, the sentence about the footman explaining the horses: "Well, sir, the others were taken by the Government. Madam gave them all away except Starlight and Ginger Girl. There is only me and Burns and another boy under military age in the stables now, sir." The structure here is okay, but the transition between the footman's sentences could be smoother.

There's also a part where the text says, "He looked about him at the bright hangings, with a wandering gaze that reverted to a spot of sunlight on Marjorie's hair and rested there." The phrase "with a wandering gaze" is a bit redundant, maybe "with a wandering gaze that lingered on a spot of sunlight..." would be better. But this is more about style than fluency.

Now moving on to coherence. The story is about Marjorie and Leonard's reunion and wedding after the war. The narrative flows from the station to the carriage, then to the homecoming, and the wedding preparations. 

I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced and connected. The transition from the station to the carriage is smooth. The introduction of characters like the footman and the family at the house is done well. However, there's a part where the text shifts from the wedding preparations to a broader reflection on the war and its impact on young soldiers. This shift feels a bit abrupt. The paragraph about the silent soldiers and their experiences is a thematic deepening, but it might interrupt the personal story of Marjorie and Leonard. It could be a bit jarring for the reader, making the narrative less coherent.

Another point is the sudden introduction of Little Herbert and the family interactions. The text moves from the couple's reunion to the family's reaction, which is logical, but the transition could be smoother. Also, the mention of the war's impact on the soldiers is a good thematic element, but it's a bit dense and might not be well-integrated into the immediate narrative of the wedding.

The ending shifts back to the immediate family scene with Little Herbert and the dinner preparations. This is a good return to the main narrative, but the earlier reflection on the war might have been better placed elsewhere or more clearly connected to the characters' emotions.

Overall, the fluency has minor issues with some awkward phrasing and possible missing words, but nothing too distracting. The coherence is mostly there, but the thematic shift about the war might disrupt the flow slightly. So, for fluency, I'd give a 4.5, and for coherence, maybe a 4, since the main narrative is clear but with a few jarring transitions.
