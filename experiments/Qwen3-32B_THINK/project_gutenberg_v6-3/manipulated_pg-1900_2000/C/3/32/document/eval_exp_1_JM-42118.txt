Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency focuses on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I need to look for any errors that might disrupt the flow.

First, I notice some repeated phrases like "the thing" and "a stuff." These seem like placeholders or missing words. For example, "the high promenades of the thing" – "the thing" doesn't make sense here, so that's a [LEXICON] issue. Similarly, "a stuff" is used multiple times where a noun should be. This affects fluency because it's unclear and disrupts reading.

There are also some awkward phrasings. For instance, "the glovemaker looked out of his sombre house over the sunlit slopes..." The phrase "over the sunlit slopes" is a bit awkward and could be smoother. That's a [SYNTAX] issue. 

Punctuation seems okay, but some sentences are run-on or have complex structures that might be hard to follow. For example, the long sentence starting with "As a fact..." could be broken up for better readability. That's a [SYNTAX] problem again.

Looking at spelling, I don't see any obvious misspellings. The words are correctly spelled. So [SPELLING] isn't an issue here.

Now, moving to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is about Fragonard's early life and the historical context. 

There are some abrupt shifts in the narrative. For example, the text jumps from describing Fragonard's childhood to the political events in France without smooth transitions. This makes the flow a bit disjointed. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue.

The use of "the thing" and "a stuff" throughout the text creates confusion. These placeholders break the narrative flow and make it hard to understand the context. That's a [CLARITY] issue.

Some historical events are mentioned in passing without sufficient context. For example, the mention of Damiens stabbing the king is a significant event, but it's not explained well in the flow of the story. This affects coherence as it's unclear how it connects to Fragonard's story. That's a [LOGIC] issue.

The text also has some inconsistencies. For example, it mentions "the king's school of six élèves protégés under Carle Van Loo" but doesn't clearly link this to Fragonard's development. This lack of connection reduces coherence. Another [STRUCTURE] issue.

Putting it all together, the fluency issues are mainly due to the placeholder words and awkward syntax. The coherence issues stem from abrupt transitions, unclear placeholders, and lack of logical connections between events. 

For the fluency score, the text has several problems with word choice and some syntax issues, but the overall readability isn't too bad. So maybe a 3.5? It's not perfect, but it's understandable. 

For coherence, the text has noticeable issues with structure and clarity due to the placeholders and abrupt shifts. The score might be around 3.0. It's coherent in parts but has enough issues to lower the score.
