Alright, let's analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

### Fluency Issues:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** The text has numerous grammatical errors, such as missing prepositions or articles. For example, "in the City of Worcester, in the Year of our Lord 1723" is grammatically correct, but other parts like "to be by him printed and published" are awkward.
2. **[SPELLING]** There are misspelled words or incorrect word forms. For example, "a stuff" and "a thing" appear repeatedly where specific nouns should be.
3. **[SYNTAX]** The syntax is often awkward or unidiomatic for modern English. The text reads more like an 18th-century document, with long, complex sentences and archaic structures.
4. **[LEXICON]** The vocabulary is archaic and inconsistent with modern English. The use of "Deponent" and "Sworn before me" is appropriate for the context but creates a barrier for modern readers.
5. **[PUNCTUATION]** The punctuation is inconsistent and sometimes incorrect. For example, the text uses semicolons and commas in ways that don't always follow modern English conventions.
6. **[WORD CHOICE]** The text uses "a stuff" and "a thing" in place of specific nouns, which is confusing and suggests placeholders or omissions.
7. **[REPETITION]** There is excessive repetition of phrases like "a stuff" and "a thing" which suggests problems with the text.
8. **[PASSIVE VOICE]** The text uses excessive passive voice constructions, which can make it less clear and more difficult to follow.

### Coherence Issues:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text lacks a clear, consistent structure. It jumps between different elements of the narrative without clear transitions.
2. **[LOGIC]** There are logical inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, the text abruptly shifts from the oath to a general commentary on heroism and then back to the narrative.
3. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt and often confusing. The text lacks smooth connections between different sections.
4. **[CLARITY]** The text is often unclear, especially with the repeated use of "a stuff" and "a thing" instead of specific nouns.
5. **[FOCUS]** The text loses focus at times, shifting from the specific story of Hannah Snell to general commentary on heroism and then back to her story.
6. **[PLOT]** The narrative is disjointed, with missing elements and unclear connections between events.
7. **[CHARACTERIZATION]** The characterization of Hannah Snell is inconsistent, shifting between a soldier and a woman without clear transitions.
8. **[CONTEXT]** The text lacks context for many of the historical references and events mentioned, making it difficult to follow for a modern reader.
9. **[TIME LINE]** The timeline of events is often unclear or inconsistent, with jumps in time that are not properly explained.

### Fluency Score:

The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward syntax, and archaic language that makes it difficult to read. The repeated use of "a stuff" and "a thing" indicates serious problems with the text. However, the text is still generally readable and follows a basic structure. I would rate it a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

### Coherence Score:

The text has significant coherence issues, including logical inconsistencies, abrupt transitions, and a lack of clear structure. The narrative is disjointed and often confusing, especially with the repeated use of "a stuff" and "a thing." The text loses focus frequently and lacks a clear progression of ideas. I would rate it a 2.5 on the coherence scale.
