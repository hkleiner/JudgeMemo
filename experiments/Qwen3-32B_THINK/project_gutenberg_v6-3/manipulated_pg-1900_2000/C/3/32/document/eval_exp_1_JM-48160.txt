Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The text is a chapter from a war zone narrative, written in an older style. First, I need to assess fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll scan for grammar, spelling, syntax, and phrasing issues. The opening has a semicolon after "France to-day is sharply divided..." which is correct, but maybe the sentence is a bit long. Then, "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit easily obtained..." – "sauv conduit" is likely a typo for "sauf conduit" (a French term for a pass). That's a spelling issue. 

Looking at other parts: "the thing" is repeated often, probably a placeholder or shorthand, which might be confusing. The structure of some sentences is complex, like "If you bring even one letter to society..." – the phrasing is a bit awkward but not incorrect. There's a sentence with "the thing (the thing)" which is redundant. Also, "the stuff" is used multiple times without context, which might be a lexicon issue. 

For coherence, the narrative jumps between the author's experiences and the war's impact. The flow is mostly logical, but there are some abrupt transitions. The repetition of "the thing" and "the stuff" without explanation could confuse readers. The story moves from Paris to the war zone, then to various cities, which is a logical progression, but some parts feel disconnected. For example, the mayor's comment about 1870 is a bit out of context. Also, the author's interactions with officials are detailed, but the connection between these events isn't always clear. 

In terms of coherence, the text has a clear structure with the author's attempts to enter the war zone, but the frequent use of vague terms like "the thing" and "the stuff" without definition might hinder understanding. The transitions between different locations and events are mostly smooth, but some parts feel abrupt. 

For fluency, the main issues are the repeated use of "the thing" and "the stuff" without explanation, some awkward phrasing, and a few spelling errors. The overall fluency is decent, but the lack of clarity in certain terms affects readability. 

Coherence-wise, the narrative is generally logical, but the vague references and some abrupt shifts in focus could be problematic. The story is coherent overall but has some minor issues that slightly disrupt the flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "sauv conduit" likely should be "sauf conduit"  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "the thing" and "the stuff" without definition creates confusion  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "If you bring even one letter to society...")  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles in "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit easily obtained..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Vague references to "the thing" and "the stuff" without context hinder clarity  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between personal narrative and war descriptions  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from Paris to Meaux to Châlons-sur-Marne with minimal connection  
- [CLARITY] Unclear purpose of the author’s repeated attempts to access the front  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
