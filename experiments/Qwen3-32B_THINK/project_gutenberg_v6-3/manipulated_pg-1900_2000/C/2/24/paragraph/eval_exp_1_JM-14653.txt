Alright, let me go through this text and see what issues I can find in terms of fluency and coherence. The user wants a detailed breakdown, so I need to be thorough.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, but I'll scan for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or spelling mistakes. The first thing I notice is that the text is written in a very formal, literary style. There are some complex sentences, which might be a bit convoluted, but that's part of the style. I don't see any obvious spelling errors. However, there are a few instances where the syntax might be a bit off or where the phrasing is a bit awkward.

For example, in the line "The next thing we know is that the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at once deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets," the structure is a bit long and could be clearer. The use of "which" here might be causing some confusion. Also, in the sentence "And when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of all hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting, candidly greedy, for the first of the great meals," the phrase "candidly greedy" is a bit jarring. It's not a standard phrase, which might affect fluency.

Another example is "We have to induce deliberately the 'Christmas feeling.'" The placement of "deliberately" here might be better placed as "deliberately induce." The sentence structure is a bit off. There's also a part where the author says "They forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual and moral, remain absolutely intact." The phrase "in their confusion" is a bit unclear and might be better phrased as "in their confusion, they forget."

Moving on to coherence. The text is a literary analysis of the changing perception of Christmas over time. The author compares past and present, and discusses the reasons for the perceived decay in the Christmas spirit. The structure is mostly logical, moving from the past to the present and then discussing the reasons for the change. However, there are some points where the transitions between ideas are abrupt or where the flow is disrupted.

For instance, in the first chapter, after discussing the past Christmas celebrations, the author shifts to the role of children in maintaining the traditions. The transition is a bit sudden and could be smoother. Also, in the second chapter, the author introduces the idea of the "set of idealists" (philosophers and scientists) as the cause of the decay in Christmas spirit. This shift from discussing the role of children to the impact of scientific and philosophical movements is a bit abrupt and could use a smoother transition.

There's also a part where the author mentions "A thermal sensor picked up movement." This sentence seems out of place in a literary essay about Christmas. It's possible that this is a typo or an error, but without context, it's hard to tell. Similarly, the line "A retinal implant synced quietly." is also out of place and disrupts the flow of the text.

Another coherence issue is in the paragraph where the author discusses the old Christmas hymns. The transition from the previous paragraph about the role of children to the hymns is a bit jarring. The author could have provided a smoother transition to connect these ideas.

Now, considering the scoring. For fluency, the text is generally well-written with a formal tone. There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure, but they don't significantly hinder understanding. The issues are minor, so I'd rate fluency a 4.5. For coherence, the text is mostly coherent, but there are some abrupt transitions and a couple of out-of-place sentences that disrupt the flow. The overall structure is logical, but these issues prevent a perfect score. I'd give coherence a 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The next thing we know is that the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at once deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets."  
- [LEXICON] Jarring phrase "candidly greedy" lacks natural flow.  
- [SYNTAX] Misplaced modifier in "We have to induce deliberately the 'Christmas feeling.'"  
- [SYNTAX] Unclear clause "in their confusion, they forget" disrupts readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from children's role to scientific idealists in Chapter Two lacks smooth transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sentences "A thermal sensor picked up movement. A retinal implant synced quietly." disrupt narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from childrenâ€™s traditions to Christmas hymns in Chapter Two.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
