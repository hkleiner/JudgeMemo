Let me evaluate the text based on the criteria for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

Looking for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [GRAMMAR] "A drone swarm aligned in formation." - This sentence is grammatically incomplete and doesn't connect with the rest of the text.
2. [GRAMMAR] "The drone's camera swiveled silently." - This sentence is grammatically incomplete and doesn't connect with the rest of the text.
3. [GRAMMAR] "The pressure door hissed as it sealed." - This sentence is grammatically incomplete and doesn't connect with the rest of the text.
4. [SYNTAX] "Being in the center of the hemp-growing section, practically all the ropes and cables used in boating on the Ohio, Mississippi and Kentucky rivers were made in Lexington." - This sentence is awkwardly structured and could be clearer.
5. [LEXICON] "This necessitated a delay, especially as the traders soon fell upon the plan..." - "Fell upon" is an unusual and slightly confusing phrase in this context.
6. [SPELLING] "The Rapids of the Ohio" - This is an inconsistent capitalization of "Rapids" as a proper noun.
7. [SYNTAX] "We have noticed that all these forts were built near a spring of unfailing water." - This sentence ends the text abruptly and seems out of place.

**Coherence Issues:**

Looking for problems with logical sequence, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and consistency in narrative structure.

1. [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "A drone swarm aligned in formation." - This sentence has no logical connection to the surrounding text and seems to be inserted randomly.
2. [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "The drone's camera swiveled silently." - This sentence has no logical connection to the surrounding text and seems to be inserted randomly.
3. [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "The pressure door hissed as it sealed." - This sentence has no logical connection to the surrounding text and seems to be inserted randomly.
4. [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure with chapters that are not numbered but only labeled with their titles. This is not a major issue but is inconsistent with typical narrative structures.
5. [CLARITY] The text jumps between different time periods without clear transitions. For example, it moves from the early 18th century to the Revolutionary War with minimal context.
6. [LOGIC] The text occasionally makes historical claims without clear explanations of their significance or how they relate to the overall narrative.

Based on these issues:

**Fluency Score:** The text is mostly fluent with clear and natural phrasing, but contains some grammatically incomplete sentences and awkward phrasing. These issues are noticeable but don't significantly disrupt the overall readability. I would rate this as a 4.

**Coherence Score:** The text has a generally logical progression and clear structure, but contains some abrupt shifts and disconnected segments (like the random drone references). These issues affect the reading experience but don't make the text difficult to follow. I would rate this as a 4.
