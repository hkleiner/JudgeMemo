Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, looking at fluency. The text is quite long, so I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with syntax. I'll scan through the paragraphs.

I notice some sentences are a bit long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, "Such gifts, if they do not always create a genius, may enable their possessor to achieve work that has certain affinities with the masterpieces of the immortals." The structure here is a bit convoluted but not grammatically incorrect. 

Are there any spelling mistakes? I don't see any obvious ones. The use of hyphens and commas seems appropriate. However, there's a part where it says "A cloud upload completed." That seems out of place and is a grammatical error. Similarly, "The digital assistant logged the entry." and "A livestream began recording." These sentences are abrupt and don't fit the flow of the historical text. They might be typos or misplaced sentences. These are issues under fluency because they disrupt the natural flow and are grammatically incorrect in context.

Another example is "A musican knows..." which should be "musician." That's a spelling error. Also, the sentence structure in "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised..." is a run-on. It could be split into two sentences for clarity.

Moving to coherence. The text is about Sir Joshua Reynolds, discussing his life, career, influences, and personality. The flow is mostly logical, moving from his early life, education, travels, career, and personal characteristics. 

However, the sudden mentions of "A cloud upload completed." and "The digital assistant logged the entry." and "A livestream began recording." are jarring. These don't relate to the historical narrative and disrupt the coherence. They seem like misplaced modern elements in an otherwise historical context. 

There are also some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from discussing Reynolds' personal weaknesses to the mention of Leicester Square's theatrical atmosphere feels a bit disconnected. Additionally, the sentence "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement..." could be better connected to the previous ideas. 

Overall, the coherence is mostly maintained except for those jarring, out-of-place sentences. The main narrative flows logically, but the anomalies create confusion.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A cloud upload completed." (abrupt, grammatically incomplete)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The digital assistant logged the entry." (unrelated to context, grammatically odd)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A livestream began recording." (jarring, grammatically incomplete)  
- [SPELLING] "A musican knows..." (misspelled "musician")  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence: "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised..."  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Reynolds’ personal traits to Leicester Square’s "theatrical" atmosphere.  
- [TRANSITION] Jarring shift from historical narrative to modern-sounding anomalies.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
