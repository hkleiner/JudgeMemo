Let me evaluate the given text according to the criteria of fluency and coherence.

# Fluency Issues

I'll look for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and other issues that affect how the text flows.

Looking at the text, I notice:
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are very long and complex, making them difficult to follow
- [STYLE] The writing style is somewhat archaic with phrases like "wherewithal" and "Mæcenas" that may be difficult for modern readers
- [PUNCTUATION] The use of em dashes and ellipses is somewhat inconsistent
- [STYLE] The text has an old-fashioned tone and vocabulary that might not be immediately accessible to all readers
- [STYLE] There are some unusual word choices like "trifle with literature" and "the Precious life-blood of a Master Spirit" that may be confusing without context

However, I don't see any clear grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. The text is generally well-written and flows naturally, though it uses a more complex and archaic style that may be challenging for some readers.

# Coherence Issues

I'll look for logical sequencing, clarity of ideas, and how well the text connects and progresses.

Looking at the text, I notice:
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between different examples and anecdotes without always making the connections clear
- [LOGIC] The author discusses the concept of a "bookman" through various examples but sometimes the transitions between examples are abrupt
- [CLARITY] Some of the metaphors and references (like "Elia" and "Mr. Shorthouse") might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the context
- [ORGANIZATION] The text moves between different aspects of bookmen without always maintaining a clear progression
- [FOCUS] The author sometimes digresses into tangential discussions about specific books and authors

The text does have a central theme about the nature of bookmen versus mere book owners, but the way it's presented with various anecdotes and examples sometimes makes the overall argument feel a bit scattered.

# Final Scores

For fluency, I would rate this text a 4. It's generally well-written with natural phrasing, but the archaic style and complex sentence structure occasionally make it more challenging to read.

For coherence, I would rate this text a 3.5. It has a clear central theme but the presentation through various anecdotes and examples sometimes lacks the smooth transitions and logical sequencing that would make it fully coherent.

Let me review my assessment one more time:

Fluency: The text is well-written with minimal grammatical issues. The archaic style and complex sentence structure are more about the author's voice than actual errors, but they do make the text somewhat more difficult to follow.

Coherence: The text has a clear central theme about bookmen, but the presentation through various anecdotes and examples lacks consistent logical sequencing and smooth transitions. The author sometimes jumps between examples without clearly connecting them.

My final assessment is:
1) Fluency Score: 4
2) Coherence Score: 3.5
