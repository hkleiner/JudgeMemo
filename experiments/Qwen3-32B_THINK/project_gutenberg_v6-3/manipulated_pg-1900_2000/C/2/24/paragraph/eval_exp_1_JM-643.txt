Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. Fluency looks at how smoothly the text reads, checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious grammatical errors. The text is quite long, so I'll need to be thorough. I notice some sentences that are a bit convoluted, which might affect fluency. For example, "He had recently recovered from a long, grave illness. I had gone to the neighbouring inn for the night, but I spent the evening in his company..." The sentence structure here is a bit complex, but not necessarily incorrect. 

Looking for spelling mistakes: "connexion" is an old variant of "connection," which might be intentional for style, but could be a typo. However, given the context and the old-fashioned tone of the story, it might be stylistic. Also, "Pinhorn" is mentioned with and without an apostrophe, but that's likely due to different contexts (e.g., "Mr. Pinhorn's" vs. "Pinhorn"). 

Syntax issues: There are some instances where the sentence structure is awkward. For example, "A self-driving cart turned left." This is a standalone sentence that seems out of place. It's possible the author intended it to be part of the narrative, but it's jarring. 

Punctuation: The text uses em dashes and commas appropriately in most cases. However, there's a sentence like "He had the high mission of bringing the paper up." The phrase "up" here is a bit unclear. It might be a typo for "up" as in "uplifting," but the context is about a weekly periodical, so maybe it's intentional. 

Word choice: The text uses some archaic or old-fashioned terms like "connexion," "procrastinated," and "fiasco," which fit the style but might be less common in modern usage. However, these aren't necessarily errors, just stylistic choices.

Overall, the fluency issues are minor. There are a few awkward phrases and one out-of-place sentence, but the text is generally well-structured and readable. So, fluency score would be around 4.5, with a few minor deductions.

Now, for coherence. Coherence is about how the story unfolds logically and smoothly, with clear progression and transitions between ideas. 

The story is a narrative about a journalist's experiences with his editor and a writer. The narrative flows from one event to another, but there are some points where the transitions are abrupt or unclear. For example, the sudden mention of "A self-driving cart turned left." This seems out of context and disrupts the flow. 

Another issue is the shift in time and perspective. The narrative jumps from the journalist's visit to Mr. Paraday to the return of the manuscript and the subsequent events. While some transitions are clear, others are abrupt. For instance, the story moves from the journalist's stay at Mr. Paraday's house to the return of the manuscript without clear transitional phrases. 

There are also some confusing references. For example, "He had been in a manner taken over from Mr. Deedy..." The phrase "in a manner" is a bit vague and could be clearer. Additionally, the use of "The drone docked without issue" and "A self-driving cart turned left" are unclear and seem out of place in the narrative, which is otherwise a 19th-century-style story. These anachronisms might confuse the reader and disrupt coherence.

The narrative does have a clear progression, but the abrupt shifts and unclear references affect the overall coherence. The story is generally coherent but has a few points where the logic or flow is interrupted. Therefore, the coherence score would be around 4, with some deductions for the out-of-place sentences and abrupt transitions.
