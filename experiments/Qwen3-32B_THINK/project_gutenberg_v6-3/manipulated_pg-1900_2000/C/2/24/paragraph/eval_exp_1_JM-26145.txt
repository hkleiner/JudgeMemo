Alright, let's take a look at this text. I need to evaluate it based on fluency and coherence. Let me start with fluency.

First, I'll check for grammar and syntax issues. The text seems mostly well-written, but there are a few spots where the grammar is off. For example, "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." feels a bit awkward. Maybe "must have been not a little delighted" is a bit forced. Also, "But very soon the matter was fruited abroad" â€“ "fruited" seems incorrect here; it should probably be "brought to light" or something similar. That's a clear spelling or word choice error.

Looking at punctuation, there are a couple of run-on sentences. For instance, the sentence starting with "The terror of his name did not die with him..." is quite long and could be split for better readability. Also, "the well-filled harem, the cultivation of 'wisdom' (which practically, no doubt, was tantamount to what we should call 'preciosity');" has a parenthetical that's a bit jarring and might be better as a separate sentence or with better punctuation.

There are some awkward phrases. For example, "A mobile hotspot activated." and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." These seem out of place in an ancient history text and might be typos or misplaced sentences. Also, "A smart pen recorded each word." The use of "smart pen" here is confusing in this context. These could be errors or stylistic choices that don't fit the overall tone.

Now, moving to coherence. The text is about the discovery of ancient tablets and the history of Egyptian pharaohs. The structure is logical, with chapters and clear sections. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the transition from discussing the tablets to the Egyptian court and administration is smooth, but some internal transitions within chapters could be better. 

There's a sudden mention of "A mobile hotspot activated" and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." These sentences seem disconnected from the surrounding content and might be errors or inserted by mistake. They disrupt the flow and coherence of the text.

The narrative does follow a logical progression, but there are a few places where the connection between ideas is weak. For example, the section on the scribes and their use of Babylonian texts is detailed but could be more clearly linked to the broader context of the tablets. Also, the mention of the queen-mother Teye and her visits to the new capital is a minor point but is presented without much context, making it feel a bit abrupt.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a clear structure, but the presence of those out-of-place sentences and some weak transitions would lower the coherence score. For fluency, the main issues are the grammar and word choice errors, along with some awkward phrasing and misplaced sentences. However, the majority of the text is well-written and readable.

Considering the scale, for fluency, the text has some errors but they don't severely impact readability. I might give it a 4. For coherence, the main issues are the disruptive sentences and some weak transitions, so maybe a 3.5.

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted" (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "fruited abroad" (incorrect word choice)
- [SYNTAX] Long, run-on sentences with excessive commas (e.g., "The terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors...")
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic terms like "A mobile hotspot activated" and "A smart pen recorded each word" (inconsistent with historical context)
- [PUNCTUATION] Poorly structured parenthetical explanation in "the cultivation of 'wisdom' (which practically, no doubt, was tantamount to what we should call 'preciosity');"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, disconnected sentences like "A mobile hotspot activated" and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" (disrupt narrative flow)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from technical description of tablets to unrelated narrative about Egyptian court without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear linkage between scribes' use of Babylonian texts and broader context of the tablets
