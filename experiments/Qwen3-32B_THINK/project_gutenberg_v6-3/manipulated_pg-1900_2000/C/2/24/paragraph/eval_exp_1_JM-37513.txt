Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. The text is an excerpt from a philosophical discussion about Spencer's philosophy of science, quoting from various authors like Tyndall and referencing works such as Sartor Resartus. The language is dense and filled with complex ideas, but I need to focus on fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. **[GRAMMAR]** "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave." This sentence is grammatically awkward. The structure is confusing with the repetition of "to the authority" and the shift in clauses.
2. **[SYNTAX]** "The monitoring device recorded the metrics." This sentence is out of context and seems disconnected from the surrounding philosophical discussion. It doesn't follow the flow of the text and might be a random insertion.
3. **[SPELLING]** "animalcular" is misspelled. The correct spelling is "animalcular" (though it's an archaic term, but the context suggests it's used correctly as is, so maybe not a spelling issue). However, if this is a typo, it's a minor issue.
4. **[SYNTAX]** "A mobile hotspot activated." Like the monitoring device sentence, this is a standalone sentence that doesn't fit into the narrative and disrupts the flow.
5. **[SYNTAX]** "A smartwatch vibrated gently." Another out-of-place sentence that doesn't connect with the surrounding philosophical content.
6. **[SYNTAX]** "The story of evolution is the story of inter-related changes." The term "inter-related" is hyphenated incorrectly; it should be "interrelated" without the hyphen.
7. **[SYNTAX]** "the several individuals get more different from others, while their connexion with others is retained and new connexions are established." The word "connexion" is an archaic spelling; the modern form is "connection." Also, the sentence structure is complex and could be clearer.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps between dense philosophical concepts and random technological references like "The monitoring device recorded the metrics" and "A mobile hotspot activated." These sentences don't contribute to the narrative and create confusion.
2. **[LOGIC]** The flow of ideas is generally logical, but the sudden insertion of unrelated sentences about technology disrupts the logical progression of the argument about Spencer's philosophy.
3. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are overly complex and could benefit from simplification to improve clarity. For example, "It is this: Every active force produces more than one change--every cause produces more than one effect." The dash and repetition of "every" could be simplified for better readability.
4. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are generally smooth, but the random sentences about technology create abrupt shifts in the narrative.
5. **[LOGIC]** The text references works and authors like "Sartor Resartus" and "Westminster Review" without providing context, which might be confusing for readers unfamiliar with these works.
6. **[LOGIC]** The text discusses Herbert Spencer's philosophy in a broad and comprehensive manner, but the sudden mentions of a mobile hotspot and smartwatch create a disjointed feel and may confuse readers about the purpose of the text.
7. **[CLARITY]** The concept of "the Unknowable" is discussed in the final section, but the text doesn't clearly explain this concept for readers who may not be familiar with Spencer's philosophy, potentially making it less accessible.

**Final Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical and syntactic issues, particularly with the random technological sentences that don't fit the narrative. There are also some spelling and hyphenation issues. However, the majority of the text is well-written and fluent. I would rate the fluency as a 4. The random sentences are the most significant issues, but they are relatively few in number and don't completely disrupt the overall readability.

**Final Coherence Score:**
The text generally follows a logical progression in discussing Spencer's philosophy, but the random technological references create significant disruptions. These elements don't contribute to the philosophical discussion and create confusion about the text's purpose. Despite these issues, the core philosophical content is coherent. I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text has a clear structure in discussing Spencer's philosophy, but the random sentences significantly impact the overall coherence.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "The monitoring device recorded the metrics" - out-of-place sentence disrupting narrative flow
- [SYNTAX] "A mobile hotspot activated" - random technological reference that doesn't connect to philosophical content
- [SYNTAX] "A smartwatch vibrated gently" - another random technological reference disrupting flow
- [SYNTAX] "the several individuals get more different from others, while their connexion with others is retained..." - archaic spelling and complex sentence structure
- [SYNTAX] "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave" - confusing repetition and clause structure

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Random technological references ("monitoring device," "mobile hotspot," "smartwatch") that don't contribute to philosophical discussion
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between dense philosophical concepts and unrelated technological elements
- [CLARITY] Complex sentence structures that could be simplified for better readability
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions created by random sentences about technology
- [LOGIC] References to works like "Sartor Resartus" and "Westminster Review" without context for general readers
- [LOGIC] Philosophical concepts like "the Unknowable" introduced without sufficient explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
