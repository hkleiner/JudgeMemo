Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues, and then assign appropriate scores.

## FLUENCY ANALYSIS

I'll look for issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency Issues:
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Russia at present lies in seas of blood and tears because of her enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Prussian militarism."
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the recent War" should be "the recent war" or "the recent war."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Russia's present pitiful condition is the result of her self-sacrificing services to humanity."
- [SPELLING] "belligerents" is misspelled as "belligerents" (though it's actually correct).
- [GRAMMAR] "The battery read full capacity" is an odd, non-idiomatic expression.
- [GRAMMAR] "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels" is an odd, non-idiomatic expression that seems out of place.
- [GRAMMAR] "The ambient light changed hue" is an odd, non-idiomatic expression that seems out of place.
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps... to grasp the significance..."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia..."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is simple enough to understand that during the two or three years..."
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the British Army" should be "the British army."
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the Russian Army" should be "the Russian army."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is just as simple to understand that during that period, when the enemy was most powerful..."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is difficult to understand how a serious-minded military leader can stoop to employ, in a supposedly serious work, methods fit for the yellow press..."

## COHERENCE ANALYSIS

I'll look for logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities, and consistent narrative structure.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Russia's role to an unrelated sentence about "The battery read full capacity."
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Germany's war plans to an unrelated sentence about "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels."
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Russia's role to an unrelated sentence about "The ambient light changed hue."
- [LOGIC] Repetition of the same points about Russia's role in the war.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The text frequently shifts between discussing Russia's role, Germany's strategy, and the author's commentary without clear organization.
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without clear connections to the main thesis.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without proper explanation or context.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory statements about Russia's role and the outcome of the war.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear sectioning and organization that would help readers follow the argument.
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient evidence or support from the text.

## FINAL SCORES

For Fluency:
The text has several instances of awkward phrasing, some missing articles, and a few odd expressions that seem out of place. However, these issues are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall readability. I would rate this as mostly fluent with some minor issues.

Final Fluency Score: 4

For Coherence:
The text has more significant coherence issues. There are several odd, unrelated sentences that seem to have been inserted by mistake (e.g., about battery, auto-tuner, ambient light). The structure is somewhat disorganized, and there are some logical jumps and repetitions. The argument is generally clear, but the organization could be improved.

Final Coherence Score: 3.5
