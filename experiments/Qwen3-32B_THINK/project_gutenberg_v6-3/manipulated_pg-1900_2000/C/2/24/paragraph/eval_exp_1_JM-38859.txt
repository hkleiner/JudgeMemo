Alright, I'll evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence according to the provided criteria.

First, let me analyze the text for fluency issues:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** The text has some grammatical issues. For example: "Yanks' heels" should be "Yankees' heels" for correct possessive form.
2. **[GRAMMAR]** There are missing articles: "attending a dance to be given by a planter by the name of Sphink" should have "the" before "planter".
3. **[GRAMMAR]** Missing punctuation in some places: "In casting lots for position in line my company drew the letter 'H'" should have a comma after "line".
4. **[GRAMMAR]** Incorrect verb tense: "We have collected at Louisville" should be "We were collected".
5. **[SPELLING]** "Forest's" should be "Forrest's" (a Confederate general).
6. **[PUNCTUATION]** Missing commas in complex sentences: "The 78th constructed the gallows and furnished the guard" could use a comma after "gallows".
7. **[SPELLING]** "Johnnies" is used in a few places - while it's a common nickname, it might be inconsistent in usage.
8. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences are awkwardly constructed: "We decided to ask the officers for a pass, but this failed" is unclear.
9. **[PUNCTUATION]** Missing periods in some places, particularly in the middle of the text.
10. **[SYNTAX]** Some run-on sentences that could be split for better readability.

Now for coherence issues:

1. **[LOGIC]** Some events seem to jump without clear transition, such as the sudden shift from military operations to the dance incident.
2. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative has a chronological structure but some dates and events are presented without clear connections.
3. **[CLARITY]** Some phrases are unclear, such as "the briars we incorporated in our feet" - it seems to mean "briars that got into our feet" but the wording is confusing.
4. **[LOGIC]** The text mentions a "scanner swept the room once" and "A fingerprint scanner glowed green" which appear to be modern anachronisms in a Civil War narrative.
5. **[LOGIC]** The text mentions "A timestamp was added automatically" which is also anachronistic and doesn't fit with the Civil War context.
6. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative jumps between different military operations without clear transitions or context.
7. **[CLARITY]** Some military terms and positions are used without clear explanation for readers unfamiliar with the Civil War context.
8. **[LOGIC]** The text abruptly ends with a description of a medical incident without returning to the main narrative thread.

Based on these issues, I'll assign scores:

For fluency: The text has some grammatical and punctuation issues, but it's generally readable and the language flows reasonably well. The problems are mostly minor and don't severely disrupt comprehension. I would rate this a 4 out of 5 for fluency.

For coherence: The text has some logical jumps and anachronistic elements that disrupt the narrative flow. The military context is clear, but the modern references to technology (scanner, timestamp) are jarring and don't fit with the Civil War setting. The narrative structure is generally chronological but lacks some smooth transitions. I would rate this a 3.5 out of 5 for coherence.
