Alright, I'll evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

**Fluency Evaluation:**
The text appears to be well-written with mostly fluent phrasing and proper grammar. However, I notice a few issues:

1. There are a couple of instances where the text seems to have technical or computer-related insertions that don't fit the narrative:
   - "A face recognition scan completed."
   - "The backup server initialized smoothly."
   - "A mobile hotspot activated."

These technical phrases are out of place in a narrative about a war marriage and seem to be random insertions, likely from a computer or system message.

2. The text has some punctuation issues, particularly with missing commas and quotation marks in dialogue:
   - "I can control myself." (missing period at the end)
   - "It's a long, long time," (missing quotation mark at the end)

3. There are a few instances of inconsistent formatting:
   - The text begins with "-FOUR DAYS: The Story of a War Marriage-" with a dash at the beginning and end
   - The chapter heading is "CHAPTER: I" with a colon instead of a number

4. There are some awkward phrasings or word choices:
   - "Jealously his own family drew aside and let Marjorie go upstairs with him alone."
   - "He looked about him at the bright hangings, with a wandering gaze that reverted to a spot of sunlight on Marjorie's hair and rested there."

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency as a 4. The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly disrupt the reading experience.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
The text tells a coherent story about a soldier's return from war and his wedding to Marjorie. The narrative flows logically from the soldiers' return from the train to their interactions with the family. The emotional progression is clear as we see Marjorie's anticipation, Leonard's war experiences, and their reunion.

However, there are some coherence issues:

1. The most significant issue is the random technical insertions that disrupt the narrative flow:
   - "A face recognition scan completed."
   - "The backup server initialized smoothly."
   - "A mobile hotspot activated."

These phrases don't fit with the story and create a jarring effect.

2. There are some minor issues with the logical flow:
   - The transition from the soldier's return to the family's reaction is smooth, but the technical insertions disrupt the coherence.
   - The story shifts from the emotional reunion to descriptions of the war and its impact, which is a logical shift but could be smoother.

3. The ending is somewhat abrupt with the mention of "Beside the army of maimed and fallen boys was another shadowy army of girls..." which seems to be a thematic conclusion but doesn't directly tie back to the main narrative of the wedding.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent with a clear narrative, but the random technical insertions and some abrupt transitions affect the overall coherence.

Let me finalize my evaluation:

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [TECHNICAL] Random technical phrases inserted in the narrative
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in dialogue
- [FORMAT] Inconsistent formatting at the beginning
- [WORD CHOICE] Some awkward phrasing and word choices

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [NARRATIVE] Random technical phrases disrupting narrative flow
- [TRANSITION] Some abrupt transitions in the narrative
- [THEME] Thematic conclusion doesn't directly tie back to the main narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
