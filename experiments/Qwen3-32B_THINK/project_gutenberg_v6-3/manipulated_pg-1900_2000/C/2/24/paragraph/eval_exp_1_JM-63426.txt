Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I need to check for any errors that might make the text hard to read.

First, I'll scan through the text. The first chapter seems okay, but I notice some commas missing in places. For example, in the line "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." The comma after "too" is missing, which could be a syntax issue. There's also "The drone docked without issue." That sentence feels a bit abrupt and unclear, maybe a grammar problem.

In the second chapter, there's a sentence: "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." The word "pi" here doesn't make sense in context; it should probably be "type" or something related to printing. That's a spelling or word choice error. 

Another part is "The laser display turned off automatically." This seems out of place in a historical narrative about a boy in the 1870s. It's an anachronism, which affects coherence but might also be a syntax issue here. Similarly, "A home pod switched tracks." That's another anachronism and doesn't fit the context, possibly a typo or incorrect phrase.

Looking at other sentences: "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." The structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe a comma is missing after "leisure," making the sentence run-on. Also, "the two jobbers are kicked." Without more context, "kicked" here is unclear, possibly a typo or incorrect word choice.

There are some missing commas, like in "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." The question mark is unnecessary and the sentence is missing a comma after "heated." Also, "You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to..." The dash here is correctly used, but the sentence structure could be clearer.

I also notice some missing commas in lists or after introductory phrases. For example, "He offers you eight dollars a week. You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to..." The transition between sentences is abrupt. 

Overall, there are a few grammar and syntax issues, some awkward phrasing, and a couple of spelling errors. The text is mostly fluent but has some issues that could interrupt the flow. 

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the narrative. The text is a biography, so the progression should be clear. The first chapter introduces Will Bradley and his impact, while the second chapter is about his early life. The transition between the two chapters is smooth, but within the chapters, there might be some abrupt shifts.

In the first chapter, the author discusses Bradley's influence and his work. However, there's a jump from talking about European artists to Bradley's work in America. The connection could be clearer. For example, the mention of "Morris failing to revive medievalism" might need more context to understand its relevance to Bradley's work.

In the second chapter, the narrative is chronological, following the boy's life. However, there are some anachronistic elements like the laser display and home pod, which don't fit the 1870s setting. These would disrupt the coherence by introducing elements that don't belong in the time period.

The story also has some abrupt transitions. For example, moving from the boy working at the newspaper to the mention of a trial involving Roosevelt is a bit jarring. The connection between these events isn't clearly explained, which might confuse the reader.

There's a part where the narrative shifts from the boy's work to a mention of traveling fakers, which is a different topic. The transition here is abrupt and the connection to the main story isn't clear, affecting the overall coherence.

The use of dashes and ellipses sometimes makes the sentences feel incomplete or disconnected. For instance, "He brings you a box of pi. When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font..." The first sentence ends with "pi," which is confusing, and then the next sentence starts a new thought without a clear transition.

Overall, the text has some coherence issues with anachronisms, abrupt shifts, and unclear transitions. However, the main narrative is generally logical and follows a chronological structure, which helps maintain some coherence.

For the fluency score, the text has minor issues with grammar, syntax, and word choice, but it's mostly readable. I'd give a 4. For coherence, the anachronisms and some abrupt transitions are noticeable but not too disruptive, so maybe a 3.5.
