Let me evaluate this text based on the two criteria: fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Evaluation:

Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. I'll look for any issues that would interrupt the smooth flow of the text.

Looking at the text:
- The text is generally well-written and readable.
- There are some minor issues with word choice and phrasing:
  - "[PREFACE]" and "[CHAPTER I]" should likely be italicized or in quotation marks rather than in brackets.
  - "mile-stone" is hyphenated unnecessarily.
  - "wonted devotion" is a somewhat archaic phrasing that's unusual but not incorrect.
  - "the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth meridian" is awkwardly phrased.
  - "a score or more of years" is an unusual phrasing.
  - "the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure" is awkwardly phrased.
  - "the city 'intra muros'" is an archaic Latin term that's not commonly used in modern English.
  - "the drone’s camera swiveled silently" appears out of context and seems misplaced.
  - "the strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth" is an unusual phrasing.
  - "the current of Manila's life when flowing at its height" is awkwardly phrased.
  - "supply themselves with the following articles" is an incomplete notice.

Based on these observations, the text is mostly fluent with minor issues. I would rate it a 4 on the fluency scale.

## Coherence Evaluation:

Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and consistent and clear structure.

Looking at the text:
- The text has a clear narrative structure with a preface, two chapters, and a logical progression of events.
- There are some minor coherence issues:
  - The mention of a "QR code" and a "timestamp" seems out of place in this historical narrative.
  - The reference to "the drone’s camera swiveled silently" is completely out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.
  - The text shifts abruptly from the main narrative to a reference to "Century Magazine for September, 1889" in the middle of Chapter I.
  - The notice at the end of Chapter II is incomplete and doesn't provide a conclusion to the narrative.
  - The text has some repetition, such as the mention of Manila Bay's rough waters in Chapter II and then the description of the bridge in Chapter II.
  - The narrative sometimes jumps between different locations and perspectives without clear transitions.

Based on these observations, the text is mostly coherent but has a few disruptions to the logical flow. I would rate it a 4 on the coherence scale.

Now I'll format my evaluation according to the requested format:
