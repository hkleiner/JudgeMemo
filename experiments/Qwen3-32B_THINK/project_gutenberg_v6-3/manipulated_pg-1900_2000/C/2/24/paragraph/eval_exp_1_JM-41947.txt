Let me analyze this text according to the evaluation criteria:

## Fluency Issues

I'll look for problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1) [GRAMMAR] - "The year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the Fourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October of 1703..." - This is a run-on sentence with poor parallel structure.
2) [GRAMMAR] - "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." - This modern phrase ("auto-tuner") appears out of nowhere in a historical narrative.
3) [GRAMMAR] - "A contactless payment completed." - Another modern phrase that appears without context in a historical narrative.
4) [GRAMMAR] - "There was a thing happened about this time..." - This is not proper English phrasing.
5) [GRAMMAR] - "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste, and he had the courage to say so." - This sentence has poor parallel structure.
6) [GRAMMAR] - "He appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like the three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of the Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his credit..." - This sentence is overly complex and awkward.
7) [GRAMMAR] - "He won them; for, in this his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris." - This sentence is incomplete and ends abruptly.
8) [SPELLING] - "Evilmerodach" - This is likely misspelled (should be "Evil-Merodach" or "Evil-Merodach").
9) [PUNCTUATION] - Frequent overuse of em dashes without clear purpose.
10) [PUNCTUATION] - Inconsistent punctuation between sentences and phrases.

## Coherence Issues

I'll look for logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and narrative consistency.

1) [LOGIC] - Sudden shifts between historical narrative and anachronistic modern elements (e.g., "A contactless payment completed" and "A phone rang from across the room").
2) [LOGIC] - The narrative jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions.
3) [LOGIC] - The text abruptly shifts from the birth of Fran√ßois Boucher to the French military situation without clear connection.
4) [LOGIC] - The narrative includes anachronistic modern references that don't fit the historical context.
5) [LOGIC] - The text abruptly shifts from historical events to the birth of a girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson without clear connection to the main narrative.
6) [LOGIC] - The text ends abruptly with an incomplete sentence about Boucher winning academic honors.

Now let me determine my scores:

For Fluency: The text has several grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and anachronistic elements that disrupt the flow. However, most of the text is generally readable and the main narrative is clear. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways, but it's still generally readable.

For Coherence: The text has significant logical issues with anachronisms, abrupt shifts in focus, and disconnected ideas. The inclusion of modern elements like "A contactless payment completed" and "A phone rang from across the room" in a historical narrative is particularly disruptive. These issues make the narrative difficult to follow in places. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing that makes understanding difficult without extra effort in some parts.

I'll now format my evaluation according to the requested format.
