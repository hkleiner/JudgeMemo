I'll analyze the given text for fluency and coherence issues, then provide scores based on the evaluation criteria.

Looking at the text:
This appears to be an excerpt from a historical analysis of the Victorian Age, discussing social, economic, and political changes during this period. It's a well-written essay with complex ideas and a formal academic tone.

**Fluency Analysis:**
I need to look for issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues I notice:
1. "A touchscreen panel showed static." - This is an odd, out-of-place sentence in an otherwise historical text. It appears to be a modern technological reference that doesn't fit with the content.
2. "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch." - Another modern technological reference that seems misplaced in a historical essay.
3. "The 3D printer finished the replica." - Another modern technological reference that appears out of context.
4. "The reign of Queen Victoria, which I have chosen to mark the limits of my survey to-day" - The use of "to-day" is archaic and inconsistent with the otherwise modern English of the text.
5. "The light taxes were raised with an ease." - This phrase is awkwardly constructed and lacks a preposition at the end.

**Coherence Analysis:**
I need to look for logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and overall narrative structure.

Issues I notice:
1. The sudden insertions of modern technology references ("touchscreen panel showed static," "notifications appeared on the smartwatch," "3D printer finished the replica") disrupt the flow and logical progression of the historical narrative.
2. The text jumps between discussing historical events and these modern technological references without explanation or context.
3. There's a lack of clear transitions between different historical periods and topics.
4. Some paragraphs begin abruptly without clear connections to the previous content.
5. The text moves between different levels of analysis (historical, philosophical, sociological) without clear signposting or transitions.

Now I'll provide the evaluation form with scores based on these observations.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent use of archaic/modern language ("to-day" vs. modern English)
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("The light taxes were raised with an ease")
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent spelling of "waggon" vs. modern "wagon"
- [LEXICON] Misplaced modern technological references ("touchscreen panel," "smartwatch," "3D printer")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative due to sudden modern technological references
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical analysis and modern tech mentions
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between different historical periods and topics
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitions between different analytical levels (historical, philosophical, sociological)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
