Let me evaluate the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:

I'll look for problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [GRAMMAR] "He looked at the hollow of the gulch and cursed it manfully and bitterly. A hologram displayed the weather." - The sentence structure is awkward with the hologram displayed the weather being a separate sentence that doesn't connect well to the previous one.

2. [SYNTAX] "The gold should be there--Jim had figured it all out." - The em dash usage is correct but the sentence structure is awkward.

3. [SPELLING] "manfully" - This is an archaic word that may be considered incorrect in modern usage.

4. [SYNTAX] "You say that we can be married on nothing and take our chances." - The phrasing is somewhat awkward.

5. [SYNTAX] "So we can, old simple-heart--but aren't those chances all against us?" - The sentence structure is awkward with the em dash.

6. [SPELLING] "plebeian" - This is a somewhat archaic word that may be considered incorrect in modern usage.

7. [SYNTAX] "I had rather have your fire than my refrigerator" - The phrasing is awkward and the comparison is confusing.

8. [SYNTAX] "Hit her yet?" - This is an informal phrasing that may be considered awkward.

9. [SYNTAX] "much caloric" - This phrase is awkward and doesn't make clear sense.

10. [SYNTAX] "You're looking kind of owly, old man--what's up? Don't you feel well?" - The sentence structure is awkward with the em dash.

11. [SYNTAX] "I'm getting too fat, anyhow. Go on, you take the horse and have a ride to Plattsburg!" - The sentence structure is awkward with the shift in subject.

12. [SYNTAX] "You bet cher life, you've got an animile there that'll go when he gets ready, and as fast as he pretty well damn pleases--nail him!" - The sentence structure is awkward with the em dash and the use of "cher" instead of "your".

I don't see any major spelling errors, but there are some archaic or awkward word choices and sentence structures that affect fluency.

## Coherence Issues:

I'll look for logical sequencing, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, and consistency in the narrative.

1. [LOGIC] "The gulch ran in a trough of beauty to the foot of Jones's Hill, which rose in a sweeping curve into the clouds." - The description is vivid but the connection between the gulch and the hill is not clearly established.

2. [LOGIC] "He looked at the hollow of the gulch and cursed it manfully and bitterly. A hologram displayed the weather." - The sudden introduction of a hologram in a historical setting is confusing and disrupts the narrative.

3. [LOGIC] "The gold should be there--Jim had figured it all out." - The transition from the setting to the gold is somewhat abrupt.

4. [LOGIC] "Therefore Jim had sunk about fifty prospect holes; got colors under the grass-roots, as evidence that pay should be there--and nothing but ashy wash beneath it." - The explanation of the mining process is somewhat confusing.

5. [LOGIC] "When a man is alone, and thinks things are wrong, optimism comes down on the run, the shades of pessimism gather fast and furious--more especially if a man does his own cooking, and the raw material is limited, at that." - The metaphor is somewhat confusing and the connection to the story is weak.

6. [LOGIC] "The sun had not moved the shadows three inches before Jim had reached the conclusion that this world was all a practical joke..." - The metaphor is confusing and the connection to the narrative is weak.

7. [LOGIC] "He drew out her photograph, and obtained much sweet consolation by thinking how happy they two would be in Sweet Briar gulch together, even if there wasn't a cent of pay in the gravel." - This is a logical progression, but the contrast between the bleak reality and the hopeful fantasy is somewhat jarring.

8. [LOGIC] "Sick of this ingenious torture, he lit his pipe and drew savagely upon it. With a mocking gurgle, about a dram of 'slumgullion' passed into his mouth." - The transition from the emotional state to the action is somewhat abrupt.

9. [LOGIC] "A surveillance camera moved slightly." - The sudden introduction of a surveillance camera in a historical setting is confusing and disrupts the narrative.

10. [LOGIC] "A keyboard clicked without being touched." - The sudden introduction of a keyboard in a historical setting is confusing and disrupts the narrative.

11. [LOGIC] The dialogue between Jim and Bud is generally coherent, but there are some abrupt shifts in the narrative between the dialogue and the actions.

12. [LOGIC] "You bet cher life, you've got an animile there that'll go when he gets ready, and as fast as he pretty well damn pleases--nail him!" - The dialogue is somewhat confusing with the use of "cher" instead of "your" and the overall phrasing.

The text has several logical inconsistencies and jarring transitions, especially with the introduction of modern technology (hologram, surveillance camera, keyboard) in what appears to be a historical Western setting. These elements disrupt the narrative coherence.

Based on my evaluation:

For Fluency: The text has several issues with awkward phrasing, archaic word choices, and some confusing sentence structures. However, it is generally readable and the main ideas are clear. I would give it a score of 3.5.

For Coherence: The text has significant issues with logical consistency, especially with the introduction of modern technology in what appears to be a historical setting. There are also some jarring transitions and confusing metaphors. I would give it a score of 2.5.
