Alright, let's go through the text and evaluate it for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

## Fluency Issues:

I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, word choice issues, and other fluency-related problems.

1. [PUNCTUATION] The text begins with "-THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE-" which is an unusual and inconsistent format.
2. [GRAMMAR] "A contactless payment completed." This is a sentence fragment.
3. [GRAMMAR] "A timestamp was added automatically." This is another sentence fragment.
4. [GRAMMAR] "A text appeared on a curved screen." This is another sentence fragment.
5. [SYNTAX] "It will lead into my subject most conveniently to contrast and separate two divergent types of mind" - This has awkward word order that makes the sentence less clear.
6. [SYNTAX] "types which are to be distinguished chiefly by their attitude toward time, and more particularly by the relative importance they attach and the relative amount of thought they give to the future" - This sentence is very long and has complex structure that makes it harder to follow.
7. [SPELLING] "æsthetic" is an unusual spelling of "esthetic" and may be distracting to some readers.
8. [SYNTAX] "But before pointing out how divergent these two types or habits of mind really are, it is necessary to meet a possible objection to what has been said." - This sentence is long and complex, making it harder to follow.
9. [SYNTAX] "We may all know there is an east and a west, but if some of us always approach and look at things from the west, if some of us always approach and look at things from the east, and if others again wander about with a pretty disregard of direction, looking at things as chance determines" - This is a very long and complex sentence with multiple conditional clauses that make it difficult to follow.

## Coherence Issues:

Now I'll look for logical flow issues, structural problems, and coherence-related problems.

1. [LOGIC] The text starts with sentence fragments about a contactless payment and timestamp, which seem completely unrelated to the main philosophical content.
2. [LOGIC] The text ends with a sentence fragment about a text appearing on a curved screen, which also seems unrelated to the main content.
3. [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure with these unrelated sentence fragments at the beginning and end.
4. [CLARITY] The text is dense with philosophical concepts and can be confusing in places, particularly where it discusses the two types of minds.
5. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, particularly when moving from one philosophical concept to another.
6. [LOGIC] The text makes a philosophical argument about two types of minds (past-oriented and future-oriented), but the examples and explanations are sometimes unclear or confusing.
7. [CLARITY] The text uses complex and abstract language that can make it difficult to follow the main argument.
8. [LOGIC] The text discusses moral philosophy but doesn't clearly connect it to the main argument about the two types of minds.

## Final Scores:

For Fluency:
The text contains several sentence fragments and has some complex sentence structures that make it harder to read. However, the majority of the text is grammatically correct and the ideas are generally expressed clearly. The issues I found are mostly minor and don't significantly disrupt the reading experience.

Score: 3.5

For Coherence:
The text has a clear central argument about the two types of minds, and the structure generally follows a logical progression. However, the inclusion of unrelated sentence fragments at the beginning and end is confusing. The philosophical concepts are complex and sometimes the explanations are dense, making it challenging to follow in places. The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother in some areas.

Score: 3.5

Actually, upon further review, I think the coherence score might be slightly higher. The text does maintain a clear central argument and the structure is generally logical. The issues I noted are present but don't significantly disrupt the overall coherence. Let me adjust my scores:

Final Fluency Score: 3.5
Final Coherence Score: 4
</think>

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Unconventional opening format "-THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE-"
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragment: "A contactless payment completed."
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragment: "A timestamp was added automatically."
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragment: "A text appeared on a curved screen."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in opening paragraph
- [SYNTAX] Long complex sentence about distinguishing mind types
- [SPELLING] Unusual spelling "æsthetic"
- [SYNTAX] Long complex sentence about meeting a possible objection
- [SYNTAX] Long complex sentence about east and west metaphors

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Unrelated sentence fragments at beginning and end
- [STRUCTURE] Unconventional structure with unrelated elements
- [CLARITY] Dense philosophical content that can be confusing
- [TRANSITION] Some abrupt paragraph transitions
- [LOGIC] Philosophical argument about mind types could be clearer
- [CLARITY] Complex and abstract language in places
- [LOGIC] Moral philosophy discussion needs clearer connection to main argument

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
