Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start with fluency.

Looking at the text, I notice some grammatical issues. For example, in the line "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The structure here is a bit awkward. The phrase "combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character" is confusing. It seems like a run-on sentence or a misplaced modifier. That would be a [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example is "He was conspicuously defunct! (_All the Year Round_, September-October, 1869.)" The use of "defunct" here might be a bit unclear or jarring in context. It's a word that usually means no longer in existence, so saying someone is "conspicuously defunct" is a bit confusing. That's a [LEXICON] issue.

There's also a sentence: "The auto-cleaning system activated." This line is out of context and seems like a technical error or an accidental insertion. It doesn't relate to the rest of the text and disrupts the flow. This would be a [STRUCTURE] issue.

Now for coherence. The text is a literary analysis of Dickens's novel, so coherence depends on logical progression and clear connections between ideas. 

The text starts with an analysis of Dickens's writing style in his later works, then moves to his health, the story of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," and various characters. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the line "The hologram flickered to life." This seems out of place and doesn't connect logically to the surrounding text. That's a [LOGIC] issue.

Similarly, the line "The battery read full capacity." Again, this is an unrelated technical statement that breaks the narrative flow. It's unclear how this relates to the analysis of Dickens's novel. This is another [LOGIC] issue.

The text also jumps between discussing the characters and their relationships, then abruptly mentions the technical lines, then continues with the analysis. These jumps disrupt the logical sequence of ideas and make the text less coherent. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue.

Overall, the text has some grammatical and syntactical issues affecting fluency, and some out-of-context statements and abrupt transitions affecting coherence. Based on the evaluation criteria, I would rate fluency as a 4 because there are some issues but they don't severely impact readability. Coherence is a bit lower at 3.5 because the abrupt transitions and unrelated statements make the text less coherent, though the main analysis is still understandable.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character"  
- [LEXICON] Jarring use of "defunct" to describe a fictional character  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unrelated line: "The auto-cleaning system activated"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected technical line: "The hologram flickered to life"  
- [LOGIC] Unrelated technical line: "The battery read full capacity"  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between literary analysis and technical anomalies  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
