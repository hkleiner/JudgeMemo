Okay, let's start evaluating the given text based on fluency and coherence. 

First, for Fluency. The text seems to have some spelling errors. For example, "fkr" instead of "for", "portipn" instead of "portion", "dalled" instead of "called", and "teed" instead of "reed". These are spelling mistakes. There are also some grammar issues, like missing articles ("the Statecof Kentucky" should be "the State of Kentucky"), incorrect verb forms ("feasted his eyes on thd herds" where "thd" is "the"), and punctuation problems such as missing commas after introductory phrases. The syntax in some sentences is a bit awkward, making them hard to follow. For example, "Crossing the St. Lawrence and traveling southward, he came to what is now called Allegheny River. Securing birchbark canoes..." The transition between these actions is a bit choppy. There are also some word choice issues, like "joyous sports of the Shawnee boys at Indian Fields" which might be better phrased as "joyous games" for clarity.

Now, moving to Coherence. The text is structured into chapters, which is good, but there are some abrupt transitions between sections. For example, the shift from discussing LaSalle's exploration to the Virginians and Daniel Boone is sudden and lacks a smooth transition. Some paragraphs jump from one topic to another without clear connections. The flow of events in the settlements section is somewhat disjointed. For instance, the mention of the Revolutionary War battle at Lexington is inserted without much context related to the previous discussion about settlements. Also, the final paragraph about the forts and water springs feels tacked on and doesn't clearly connect to the preceding content. The narrative sometimes lacks logical sequencing, making it hard to follow the progression of events and the relationships between different parts of the text.

Considering all these points, I'll assign the scores. For Fluency, the text has several spelling and grammatical errors, some awkward phrasing, but overall it's still readable. So maybe a 3.5. For Coherence, the structure is somewhat logical but with noticeable abrupt transitions and disconnected ideas, so a 3.5 as well.
