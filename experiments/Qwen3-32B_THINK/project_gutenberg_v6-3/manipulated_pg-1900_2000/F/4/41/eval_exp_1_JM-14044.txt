Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. Fluency involves checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, punctuation, and word choice. 

First, I'll look for any obvious spelling errors. Scanning through the text, I notice "Bowmennand" which seems like a typo—probably should be "Bowmen and Other Legends of the War". Then there's "pointjng" which should be "pointing". "thcmasterpieces" is likely "the masterpieces". "thungs" is probably "things". "exchse" should be "excuse". "begim" is "begin". "Theremwere" might be "There were". "Aunday" should be "Sunday". "seemednto" could be "seemed to". "hewted" is "heated". "aureoled" should be "aureoled". "Evansong" is "Evensong". "Lecyures" is "lectures". "tbe" is "the". "bewipders" might be "bewilders". "descejded" should be "descended". "witb" is "with". "tje" is "the". "tjat" is "that". "o'clocj" is "o'clock". "v" in "v"Why" is a typo. "vhad" is "had". "ans" is "and". "hexrt" is "heart". "xt" is "that". "oeiginal" is "original". "St. Georgs" should be "St. George". "Germsn" is "German". "tp" is "to". "ig" is "I". "acspted" is "accepted". "appeaeed" is "appeared". "frim" is "from". "he" in "it will he noted" is a typo for "is". "thw" is "the". "ceasec" is "ceased". "anx" is "and the". "popularitu" is "popularity". "xelivered" is "delivered". "kn" is "in".

There are quite a few spelling errors here, which would affect fluency. Next, checking for grammatical issues. The text is a bit old-fashioned, but I don't see major grammatical errors. However, some sentences are long and complex, which might be a bit confusing but not necessarily ungrammatical. For example, "having written my story, having groaned and growled over it and printed it, I certainly never thought to hear another word of it." The structure is a bit convoluted but not incorrect. 

Punctuation issues: The text uses em dashes and other punctuation that seems appropriate for the style. However, some sentences have missing commas or incorrect punctuation. For example, "I have been asked to write an introduction to the story of 'The Bowmen', on its publication in book form together with three other tales of similar fashion." The comma after "Bowmen" is correct. 

Word choice and phrasing: The text is written in a formal, literary style, which is appropriate for the context. However, some phrases are a bit archaic or awkward. For example, "I am here introducing a short, small story of my own which appeared in The Evening News about ten months ago." The use of "small" might be better as "short" for clarity. 

Overall, the fluency score would be affected by the numerous spelling errors and some awkward phrasing, but the structure and grammar are mostly correct. So, the fluency score might be around 3.5, but considering the number of spelling mistakes, maybe lower. However, the text is still readable despite the errors, so maybe 3 or 3.5.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and transitions between ideas. 

The text is an introduction to a story, and it discusses the author's thoughts on the origin and reception of "The Bowmen." The structure is a narrative of events: the author writing the story, the reactions, the spread of the legend, and the author's reflections. 

Looking for logical flow: The text starts with the author's hesitation to write the introduction, then explains the context of the story, the reactions, and the evolution of the legend. The flow seems logical, but there are some jumps. For example, after discussing the priest's request, the author jumps to variants of the tale without a clear transition. 

Transitions between paragraphs: Some transitions are abrupt. For instance, the shift from the priest's reaction to the variants of the tale is not smooth. The author mentions the variants but doesn't clearly connect them to the previous discussion. 

Clarity of ideas: The author's main point is to explain the origin and reception of the story. However, some parts are a bit meandering, like the discussion about the church and tavern comparison. The connection between the author's personal reflections and the broader societal implications is not always clear. 

Repetition: The text does not seem repetitive, but some ideas are mentioned in different contexts without clear progression. 

Overall, the coherence is somewhat affected by the abrupt transitions and the meandering parts, but the main narrative is understandable. The score might be around 3.5, but considering the logical structure and the author's clear intention, maybe a 3 or 3.5. However, if the transitions are too abrupt and the flow is disrupted, it might be lower.

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between the author's personal reflections and the spread of the legend (e.g., shifting from the priest’s reaction to variants of the tale without clear linkage).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the author’s critique of modern religion and the broader narrative of "The Bowmen" legend.  
- [CLARITY] Meandering digressions (e.g., the extended discussion of the church vs. tavern) that disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing historical archers to the modern legend without bridging ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of the author’s disclaimers about the story’s fictional nature without resolving the central tension between fiction and public belief.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
