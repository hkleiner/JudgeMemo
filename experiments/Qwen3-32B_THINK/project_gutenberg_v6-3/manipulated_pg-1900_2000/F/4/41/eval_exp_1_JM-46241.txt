Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency issues. The text is a historical analysis of early woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and punctuation problems.

Looking at the first paragraph: "ib place of hand-painting" – "ib" should be "in". That's a spelling error. "brlongs" is misspelled; it should be "belongs". "succesw" is "success". "Gothicvin" should be "Gothic in". "prunting" is "printing". "bexause" is "because". "thirteenth qnd fourteenth" – "qnd" is "and". "iloustrated" should be "illustrated". "blodks" is "blocks". "concersd" is "concerned". "mqrgin" should be "margin". "ahidh" is "which". "charactsr" is "character". "Grrman" is "German". "readerw" is "readers". "othee" is "other". 

There are several other typos and misspellings. Also, some abbreviations like "c." are used but not consistently. The text has some awkward phrasing, like "the beginning of the end was on them" which could be "the beginning of their end was upon them". "by dint of reusing the old blodks" should be "by dint of reusing the old blocks". 

Now, coherence. The text discusses various printers and their works. The structure is chronological and thematic, but some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, moving from discussing Gunther Zainer's works to John Reger's book feels sudden. There's a lot of specific information about different books and printers, which is detailed but could be overwhelming. Some parts mention specific examples without clear connections to the main argument. The flow between sections is mostly logical, but there are instances where the reader might lose track of the main point, especially with the numerous examples. The conclusion about the artistic merit of the books is present but could be more clearly tied back to the earlier discussions.

For fluency, the text has multiple spelling and minor grammatical errors, but the overall meaning is clear. For coherence, the structure is mostly logical, but the transitions and some repetitive mentions of printers and books might disrupt the flow. I'll assign scores accordingly, considering the scale provided.

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between printers (e.g., Gunther Zainer to John Reger) without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] Repetitive focus on specific books/prints with minimal synthesis of broader themes  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense technical details about letter design and ornamentation, risking reader disengagement  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt introduction of "transitional" books without linking to earlier/next sections  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between artistic merit claims and preceding examples  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
