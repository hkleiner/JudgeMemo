Alright, I'll evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the instructions. I need to detect issues, summarize them, and then provide scores on a 1-5 scale.

### Fluency Issues

Looking at the text, I notice several issues with grammar, spelling, and punctuation that affect fluency:

1) [SPELLING] "whobstepped" should be "who stepped"
2) [SPELLING] "cjurch" should be "church"
3) [SPELLING] "bsigned" should be "signed"
4) [SPELLING] "four days past, of the tipstaff's friend" - this is awkward phrasing
5) [SPELLING] "vSeptember" should be "September"
6) [SPELLING] "borex" should be "bored"
7) [SPELLING] "sef aside" should be "set aside"
8) [SPELLING] "intrigying" should be "intriguing"
9) [SPELLING] "good-for-nothinfs" should be "good-for-nothings"
10) [SPELLING] "frjghten" should be "frighten"
11) [SPELLING] "chiod" should be "child"
12) [SPELLING] "comwly" should be "commonly"
13) [SPELLING] "anx stand newrer" should be "and stand nearer"
14) [SPELLING] "xn artist" should be "an artist"
15) [SPELLING] "Bouchwr" should be "Boucher"
16) [SPELLING] "stepled" should be "stepped"
17) [SPELLING] "hie life" should be "his life"
18) [SPELLING] "Lemoyje" should be "Lemoyne"
19) [SPELLING] "doubls-florins" should be "double-florins"
20) [SPELLING] "it was in the house of one of its rich families, waa born" should be "was born"
21) [SPELLING] "indeedbhe" should be "indeed he"
22) [SPELLING] "Boufher" should be "Boucher"
23) [SPELLING] "fhe impulse" should be "the impulse"
24) [SPELLING] "w day" should be "a day"
25) [SPELLING] "nHe" should be "He"
26) [SPELLING] "whsther" should be "whether"
27) [SPELLING] "stucy" should be "study"
28) [SPELLING] "tast" should be "taste"
29) [SPELLING] "snd" should be "and"
30) [SPELLING] "on his return to Paris." (sentence fragment)

These spelling and grammatical errors disrupt the flow and make the text less fluent.

### Coherence Issues

Looking at the overall coherence of the text:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions or signposting.
2) [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes lacks logical connections between events. For example, it moves abruptly from the birth of François Boucher to military events in France without clear contextual links.
3) [TRANSITION] There are few clear transitions between paragraphs or sections, making it difficult to follow the progression of the narrative.
4) [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, making it difficult to grasp the main points. For example, "The worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner to Mademoiselle Boullenois..."
5) [PERSPECTIVE] The narrative shifts between different perspectives and time points without clear indication, which can be confusing.
6) [PACING] The pacing is uneven, with some events described in great detail while others are mentioned only briefly or not at all.
7) [COHESION] The text lacks cohesive devices that would help connect ideas and maintain a clear narrative thread.

Despite these issues, the text does follow a chronological narrative about François Boucher's life and early career, which provides a basic level of coherence.

### Final Scores

For fluency, I would give a score of 2.5. The text contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors that significantly affect readability. While it's generally understandable, the errors are frequent and distracting.

For coherence, I would give a score of 3. The text follows a chronological narrative about Boucher's life, which provides some structure. However, it lacks clear transitions between sections, has uneven pacing, and some logical gaps in the narrative flow.

Let me now put this in the requested format.
