Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. 

First, **fluency**. I need to look for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through the text again.

I notice some spelling errors. For example, "slaughter-hoyse" should be "slaughter-house". There's also "strugglimg" which is misspelled as "struggling". Then "atrriving" is probably "arriving", and "extempkrized" should be "extemporized". "Vamp" is likely "van", maybe a typo. "Fifteen hundrednmiles" is missing a space. "Devicecfor" should be "device for". "Efvect" is "effect". "Waggons" is correct, but "liled" should be "lied". "Ths" is "the". "Xindery" is "inder" or maybe "inder". "Calmkly" is "calmly". "Tne" is "the". "Aps" is "aping". "Whzt" is "what". "Sppendid" is "splendid". "Thag" is "that". "Fpr" is "for". "Salvernand" is "salver and". "Ot" is "of". "Vs" is "as". "Thag" is "that". "Thevcraft" is "Their craft". "Hammets" is "hammers". "Wwre" is "were". "Avcomplicated" is "a complicated". "Artfukly" is "artfully". "Thevcraft" again. "Suxcessful" is "successful". "Hengulates" is "regulates". "Sucxess" is "success". "Sufcess" is "success". "Mechxnical" is "mechanical". "Breadbfrom" is "bread from". "Luxueious" is "luxurious". 

These spelling errors are quite frequent and might distract the reader. Also, some word choices seem off, like "vamp" instead of "van" or "inder" instead of "inder" (not sure about that one). The use of non-standard spellings like "waggons" instead of "wagons" is consistent, but maybe that's intentional for style. However, the errors like "strugglimg" and "atrriving" are clear typos. There's also "he walked our thoroughfares" – "our" might be a typo for "the". 

Next, **coherence**. I need to check for logical flow, transitions, and structure. The text is a narrative about Gypsies in Liverpool and Birkenhead. The chapters are titled appropriately, and the story progresses from the arrival of the Gypsies to Kola's leadership. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from the initial scene at the slaughter-house to the description of the women's appearance is smooth, but the shift to Kola's character and his interactions with the city seems a bit disconnected. The text jumps from describing the Gypsies' arrival to Kola's personality without a clear transition. Also, the ending of the first chapter and the start of the second chapter could be smoother. 

There's a part where the author discusses Kola's multiple nationalities and how he changes his identity, which might be confusing if not clearly explained. The mention of his tribe's governance as an "Imperium in Imperio" is a good concept, but the flow from his economic activities to the political structure is a bit abrupt. Additionally, the conclusion about Kola's success and his kingdom's sustainability is clear, but the transition from his methods to the philosophical conclusion about their alien nature is a bit jarring. 

Some sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the sentence about Kola's contract and how he hoodwinks authorities is a bit convoluted. Also, the use of phrases like "he and his tribe live in our midst untouched" is a bit vague without prior context. 

Overall, the text has some fluency issues due to spelling and occasional word choice errors, and coherence issues due to some abrupt transitions and complex sentences. The story is mostly coherent but has minor hiccups in flow.
