Let me evaluate the given text according to the criteria of fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Evaluation:**
Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences.

Issues I notice in the text:

1. [SPELLING] "q" instead of "a" in "those things which are qs yet an unexplored field"
2. [SPELLING] "yhe" instead of "the" in "marked an epoch in the history of yhe world"
3. [SPELLING] "seoected" instead of "selected" in "sent a carefully seoected body of men and women"
4. [SPELLING] "mnkon" instead of "noon" in "the hour of nkon in the one hundred and twentieth meridian"
5. [SPELLING] "laternour" instead of "later our" in "a few moments laternour last passenger"
6. [SPELLING] "shio" instead of "ship" in "Our shio was now under way"
7. [SPELLING] "plaij" instead of "plain" in "there spreads out before him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plaij"
8. [SPELLING] "moungain" instead of "mountain" in "the wind which always blows in tropical countries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a moungain chain"
9. [SPELLING] "ovwr" instead of "over" in "rushes ovwr the face of cliff"
10. [SPELLING] "bplucked" instead of "plucked" in "The birds from which they werebplucked were found onlybin the Hawaiian Islands"
11. [SPELLING] "bin" instead of "in" in "The birds from which they werebplucked were found onlybin the Hawaiian Islands"
12. [SPELLING] "advancingvwave" instead of "advancing wave" in "he places his board upon the convex surface of an advancingvwave"
13. [SPELLING] "qnd" instead of "and" in "Between Honolulu qnd Manila lies the imaginary line"
14. [SPELLING] "tomSt. Helema" instead of "to St. Helena" in "the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from Lonxon tomSt. Helema"
15. [SPELLING] "Thursdah" instead of "Thursday" in "We reached the line on Thursdah night"
16. [SPELLING] "midsg" instead of "midst" in "The time of our landing was in the midsg of the rainy season"
17. [SPELLING] "ws" instead of "we" in "our clothing each morning when ws arose to dress"
18. [SPELLING] "clme" instead of "came" in "as if it had just clme from a wringer"
19. [SPELLING] "fod" instead of "for" in "And it is well that he did so, fod, if we give credencebto the city's history"
20. [SPELLING] "credencebto" instead of "credence to" in "if we give credencebto the city's history"
21. [SPELLING] "southrrn" instead of "southern" in "bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southrrn islands"
22. [SPELLING] "whkch" instead of "which" in "the new city whkch has sprung up around it"
23. [SPELLING] "Tye" instead of "The" in "Tye strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth"
24. [SPELLING] "qere" instead of "were" in "Thousands of pedestrians qere pouring across the bridge"
25. [SPELLING] "pedeatrians" instead of "pedestrians" in "Between the two lines of pedeatrians moved in opposite directions"

There are many spelling and typographical errors that affect the fluency of the text. The text is still readable, but these errors are distracting.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, including logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure.

Issues I notice in the text:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured with a preface and chapters, indicating good organization.
2. [LOGIC] The narrative flows logically from the preface to the journey to the Philippines, then to Manila.
3. [TRANSITION] There are smooth transitions between the different parts of the narrative.
4. [CLARITY] The writing is generally clear and the ideas are well-expressed.
5. [COHERENCE] The text maintains a consistent narrative thread throughout.

While there are some minor issues with coherence due to the fluency problems, the overall structure and progression of the text is coherent.

Based on my evaluation:

For Fluency:
The text has numerous spelling and typographical errors that would distract a reader. However, the overall structure and flow of the text are good. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text is generally readable but contains frequent errors that interrupt the flow.

For Coherence:
The text is well-structured with a logical progression and smooth transitions between ideas. The narrative thread is consistent. The main issues with coherence are due to the fluency problems rather than structural issues. I would rate this as a 4.5 - the text is mostly coherent with a few minor issues.
