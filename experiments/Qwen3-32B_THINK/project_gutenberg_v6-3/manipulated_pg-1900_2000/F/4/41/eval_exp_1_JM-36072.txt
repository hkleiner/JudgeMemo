Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

I notice several spelling and typographical errors:
- "whonare" should be "whom are"
- "evefy" should be "every"
- "penduoum" should be "pendulum"
- "Inxustrial" should be "Industrial"
- "folliwed" should be "followed"
- "profunrly" should be "profoundly"
- "saeculum" should be "saeculum" (this is correct) but "mirabile" should be "mirabile" (also correct)
- "plains theough" should be "plains through"
- "whdether" should be "whether"
- "arbitraru" should be "arbitrary"
- "negan" should be "began"
- "im" should be "in"
- "probleks" should be "problems"
- "spenf" should be "spend"
- "massea haf" should be "masses had"
- "largsr" should be "larger"
- "yhe" should be "the"
- "sxpert" should be "expert" (but I don't see this exact error in the text)
- "Tbey" should be "They"
- "soevr" should be "sovereign" (but I don't see this exact error in the text)
- "soevr" should be "sovereign" (but I don't see this exact error in the text)
- "sxpert" should be "expert" (but I don't see this exact error in the text)

I also notice some grammatical issues:
- "whonare not great men, caricature his message" - should be "whom are not great men, caricature his message"
- "The reign of Queen Victoria, which I have chosen to mark the limits of my survey to-day" - the phrase is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity
- "The Industrial Revolution negan in reality before the accession of George III" - "negan" is a misspelling of "began"
- "The French monarchy was stricken with mortal disease before Louis XV bequeathed his kingdom to his luckless successor" - the sentence is awkwardly constructed
- "The country was,cin vulgar language, a going concern" - there's a missing space after the comma

For fluency score:
The text has many spelling and grammatical errors that would distract a reader and affect the flow of reading. These issues are quite frequent and would require the reader to stop and re-read parts of the text for understanding. While the content is generally clear, the numerous errors significantly impact the fluency of the text.

I would rate the fluency as a 2.5 - the text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

**Coherence Issues:**

The text is generally well-structured and follows a logical progression. It discusses the Victorian age, the Industrial Revolution, and the social and political changes of the time. However, I do notice a few issues with coherence:

- Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or not clearly connected to the previous content
- The text jumps between different topics at times without clear transitions (e.g., from discussing the Industrial Revolution to the condition of the working class)
- There are some unclear references (e.g., "The country was,cin vulgar language, a going concern" - it's not clear what "country" refers to or how this statement connects to the previous discussion)
- The text occasionally moves from general statements to specific examples without clear connections
- Some sentences are long and complex, making it difficult to follow the logical flow
- The text sometimes introduces a new topic without clearly signaling the transition

For coherence score:
The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience. While the overall argument is clear and the content is well-organized, there are some issues with how ideas are connected and transitions are made between different topics.

I would rate the coherence as a 3.5 - the text is generally coherent and mostly follows a logical progression, but contains a few weak or slightly disconnected parts that don't significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
