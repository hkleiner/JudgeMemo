Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency issues. The text is quite long, so I need to go through it carefully. First, I'll check for grammar and spelling errors. I notice some words are misspelled, like "behjnd" instead of "behind" and "rexembled" instead of "resembled." There are also some typos like "t'a" with a diacritic that might not be necessary here.

Next, syntax and phrasing. There are some awkward sentences. For example, "we soon left behjnd us the pleasant little Chinese town Chin-t'a..." has a misplaced word. Also, some sentences are run-on or have incorrect punctuation, like missing commas or incorrect hyphenation. For instance, "The great high road -- joining K'ou-li (the territory inside the Great Wall) and K'ou-wai (the territory outside) has in North Kansu an E-W direction..." should probably have a comma after the em dash.

Looking at word choice, there are instances where words are used incorrectly. "Rexembled" is a typo for "resembled," and "umhesitatingly" should be "unhesitatingly." Also, "themothers" is a typo for "the mothers," and "tribebhad" should be "tribe had."

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a detailed account of an expedition, so the structure should be logical. However, there are some abrupt shifts in the narrative. For example, the transition from describing the village to the legend of their origins is a bit sudden without a clear connection. Also, some paragraphs jump between topics without smooth transitions, like moving from the lamas to the local administration without a clear link.

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "the ruin near the present temple had belonged to a race of people, having tails, whom the Chinese call Kuzurkei." This is a bit confusing because it's not clear how this connects to the previous or next sentences. Additionally, some parts are repetitive, like the mention of the Chinese style of clothing and architecture in multiple places without adding new information.

The overall flow of the text is mostly logical, but there are a few places where the reader might need to infer connections. The description of the village and its people is detailed, but the transitions between different aspects (clothing, customs, language) could be smoother. The ending about the YÃ¶gur's lack of written language and their interactions with the lamas is a bit abrupt after the detailed descriptions of their daily life.

Considering all these points, the fluency has several errors but is still mostly readable. The coherence is good overall but has some issues with transitions and unclear references. I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria provided.
