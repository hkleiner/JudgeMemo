Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency issues. The text is a narrative about a Chinese girl named Kuei Ping and her experiences. First, I notice several spelling mistakes. For example, "ky" should be "my," and "brilluancy" is misspelled. There are also typos like "bembought" and "hoysehold." These spelling errors would fall under the [SPELLING] category. 

Next, grammatical errors. The sentence structure sometimes is awkward. For instance, "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with ky limited knowledge of her language could make it." The phrasing here is a bit convoluted. Also, missing commas where needed, like in "To the women of America I dedicate this story of the life of my Chinese friend and teacher: it is as accurate as she with her small store..." The colon here is misused or could be better punctuated. These are [GRAMMAR] issues.

Looking at syntax, there are run-on sentences and some awkward phrasing. For example, "Kuei Ping had slipped into the background, but her mother and the relative looked over the jewels and then up at Madame Yen as if fo agree that they were not worthyvof attention." The phrase "as if fo agree" should be "as if to agree," and "worthyvof" is a typo. These are [SYNTAX] problems.

Now for coherence. The story is about Kuei Ping's journey to buy dowry jewels and her internal conflict about her marriage versus her education. The narrative flows generally, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from the jewelry shop to her memory of the mission school is a bit sudden. This could be a [TRANSITION] issue. Also, the mention of the engagement bracelets and the silver medal at the end might be a bit confusing in how they tie into her internal conflict, possibly a [CLARITY] problem.

The structure of the story is mostly linear, but some parts feel a bit meandering. For instance, the detailed description of the jewelry shop and the bargaining process, while vivid, might slow down the narrative and make the main conflict less immediate. This could be a [STRUCTURE] issue. Additionally, the cultural context is present, but some references might not be clear to all readers, leading to potential [LOGIC] issues in understanding the significance of certain customs.

Putting this all together, the fluency issues are significant but not overwhelming, with several spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability. The coherence is generally good, but there are some transitions and structural elements that could be smoother. Based on the scale, fluency might be a 3 or 3.5, and coherence around 4 or 4.5. But I need to check the exact scale descriptions again to be precise.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the jewelry shop to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between the engagement bracelets and the silver medal at the end and their significance to her internal conflict
