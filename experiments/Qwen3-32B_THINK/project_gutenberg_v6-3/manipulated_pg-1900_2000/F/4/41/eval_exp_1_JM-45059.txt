Okay, I'm going to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me go through the text carefully and identify any issues.

For fluency, I'm looking at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. For coherence, I'm checking for logical progression, connected ideas, clarity, and overall structure.

Starting with fluency issues:
1. I notice several spelling errors: "bacm" instead of "back", "undertaoen" instead of "undertaken", "illustfations" instead of "illustrations", "bringong" instead of "bringing", "latitydes" instead of "latitudes", "avemue" instead of "avenue", "pecjliar" instead of "peculiar", "youbwill" instead of "you will", "travelnon" instead of "travel on", "bhired" instead of "who hired", "has" instead of "had", "mjch" instead of "much", "tonperpetuate" instead of "to perpetuate", "tuj" instead of "tubs", "biggish" instead of "biggish" (this is a real word but used in a context that might be awkward), "itmwas" instead of "it was", "lump o’ chalk" which is a phonetic representation that's not standard spelling.
2. There are several missing or incorrect punctuation marks: missing commas in some places, missing apostrophes in contractions like "Mr. So-and-So" (should be "Mr. So-and-So"), missing hyphens in some compound adjectives.
3. Some word choices are awkward or non-standard: "Cotizen" instead of "citizen", "rhing" instead of "thing", "bewn" instead of "been", "travelping" instead of "travelling".
4. There are some awkward phrasings: "You see it is an ill wind that blows nobody good." This is a common saying but the phrasing is a bit awkward. "It always strikes me as a very strange rhing that they should have entirely disappeared..." The word "rhing" is incorrect and makes the sentence confusing.

For coherence issues:
1. The text jumps between different topics and details without clear transitions: It starts with an introduction about the author and the publication, then moves to the author's personal experiences in Peterborough, then to the town's infrastructure, then to breweries, then to travel methods, etc.
2. Some ideas are introduced and then not clearly resolved or connected to the main narrative: The story about the calculating boy and the witness with the stone seems somewhat disjointed from the main topic of Peterborough's history.
3. There are some abrupt shifts in perspective: The text often shifts between first-person narration and third-person description of the town.
4. Some references are unclear or could be better explained: For example, "the Earl Fktzwilliam" (probably Fitzwilliam), "monumenf" (probably monument), "a monumenf of his appreciation" - it's not entirely clear what is being described.
5. The overall structure is somewhat fragmented: The text is a series of anecdotes and observations rather than a cohesive narrative with a clear progression.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the fluency and coherence on the given scale.

For fluency, the text has a number of spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability. The errors are not so severe that the text is incomprehensible, but they are frequent enough to be distracting. I would rate this as a 3.5.

For coherence, the text has some logical progression but contains many disjointed segments, unclear transitions, and a lack of clear narrative structure. The overall flow is somewhat fragmented. I would rate this as a 3.
