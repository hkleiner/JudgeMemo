Okay, let's start by reading through the text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence. 

First, fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through the text again. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "THEY cannot be separated any more than sheep and a shepherd, but I am minded to speak of the bookman rathee than of his books..." I notice "rathee" instead of "rather." That's a spelling error. Then later, "hucksrer" instead of "huckster." Another spelling mistake. There's "kgnore" instead of "ignore." So that's a problem. 

Continuing through the text, there's "hasn'this conservatory" which should be "hates this conservatory." Missing an apostrophe. Also, "heen" instead of "been." Spelling errors again. Then "mafdt-place" instead of "market-place." More typos. "contxined" instead of "contained." "upsidedkwn" becomes "upside down." Missing letters. "himsepf" should be "himself." "soecchests ov books" is "sent him some chests of books." "jnc" as "in the best editions." "thr history" instead of "the history." "je had" instead of "he had." "coteries of clever people who go crazy for a brief time over the tweetling of a minor poet" – "tweetling" is probably "tweebling" or another word? Maybe a typo. 

There are also some awkward phrasings. For example, "It isbthe chief office of the cditic..." should be "It is the chief office of the critic..." Missing spaces and letters. "According to the weigytiest of French critics..." "weigytiest" is "weightiest." 

In terms of grammar, some sentences are run-on or have incorrect punctuation. For instance, "And the children of the twenty thousand will not know _Twice Murdered_, but the children of the twenty, with others added to them, will know and love _Mark Rutherford_." This is a long sentence that might be better split for clarity. Also, some commas are missing where they're needed for clarity.

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a narrative about bookmen, their characteristics, and examples. The main idea is to distinguish between bookmen and book owners. The structure seems to flow from defining a bookman, using anecdotes, and then discussing their preferences and values. 

However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after the first anecdote about the dinner and the library, the text jumps to the colonial squatter story. The connection isn't immediately clear, but it's used to support the main point. There's also a shift from discussing the squatter to the criteria for a classic book. 

Some parts might be confusing. For instance, the mention of specific books and authors (like Mark Rutherford) could be unclear to someone unfamiliar with them. However, the overall argument about bookmen's judgment is still present. 

There are a few instances where the flow is disrupted. For example, the part about the critic and the cathedral metaphor is a bit abstract, but it's part of the argument. The text does return to the main theme, so it's not too jarring. 

In terms of logical sequencing, the text starts with defining a bookman, gives examples, and then discusses their values and the importance of classic literature. The progression is logical, though the anecdotes are a bit scattered. 

Overall, the coherence is mostly there, but the fluency has several spelling and grammar issues that could affect readability. The coherence issues are minor, with some transitions that could be smoother, but the overall structure is clear.
