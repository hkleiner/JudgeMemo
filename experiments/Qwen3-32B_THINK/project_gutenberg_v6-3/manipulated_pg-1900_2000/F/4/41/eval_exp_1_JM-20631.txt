Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a lengthy text and wants me to assess it for fluency and coherence using the Likert scale. First, I need to understand the criteria clearly. 

Starting with fluency, the key is to check for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll go through the text and look for any errors in these areas. For example, I notice some typos like "tbe first day" instead of "the first day" and "consciousnrss" instead of "consciousness." There's also a missing word in "ArthurcDwvis" which should be "Arthur Davis." These are spelling and typo issues. Then there are grammatical errors like "He was born in 1846 and died on tbe first day of Passover, 1906." The word "tbe" is a typo. Also, "He was able to puf his learning to good use" – "puf" should be "put." 

Looking at syntax and structure, some sentences are run-on or awkward. For instance, "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." The dashes here might be better as commas or periods for clarity. 

Word choice issues: "ov Hebrew" should be "of Hebrew," "dirrction" is "direction," "reatoring" is "restoring," "prlcess" is "process." These are spelling errors. Also, "cpnduct" should be "conduct," "undiluted" is misspelled as "undiluted" (but that's correct, wait, maybe it's a typo in the text?), "unstznd" is "understand." 

Punctuation: Some sentences have inconsistent punctuation. For example, "We see before our eyes Welsh and Irish in process of being saved from extinction, with the hope perhaps of reatoring their ancient glories in poetry and prose." The comma before "with the hope" might be a serial comma issue. Also, "The proposition contains just that dash of truth which is more dangerous than falsehood undiluted;" – "undiluted" is correct, but the semicolon might be better as a period. 

Moving on to coherence. The text is about Arthur Davis and the concept of the Chosen People. The structure is generally logical, moving from Davis's background to his work, then discussing the revival of Hebrew, and comparing it to other languages. However, some transitions are abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing Davis to the revival of Hebrew and then to examples of other ritual languages is a bit jarring. The examples of other languages are listed without clear transitions, which might confuse the reader. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "The recent revelation of racial arrogance in Germany..." – this is vague without context. The mention of specific historical figures and events (like Julian the Apostate, Fichte, Treitschke) might be confusing if the reader isn't familiar with them. 

The text also jumps between different topics, like from Davis's contributions to the Chosen People concept, then to examples of other languages, and then back to the implications of the Chosen People. These jumps could disrupt the flow. 

Some ideas are repeated or not fully explained. For example, the comparison between Germanism and Judaism's doctrine of election is mentioned but not deeply explored. The connection between the examples of other languages and the main argument about Hebrew's revival isn't always clear. 

The conclusion ties back to Davis's legacy, which is a good wrap-up, but the earlier sections might leave the reader wondering how the various examples connect to the central thesis. 

Considering the fluency issues, the text has multiple spelling and grammatical errors that would distract a reader. However, the overall structure and meaning are still understandable. For coherence, while the text follows a general structure, the transitions between sections and some unclear references might make it a bit confusing. 

So, for fluency, the errors are numerous but not so severe that the text becomes unreadable. It's mostly readable but with noticeable issues. That would probably be a 3 or 3.5. For coherence, the structure is logical but has some abrupt transitions and unclear references, which would be a 3 or 3.5 as well. However, since the user allows half-points, I need to decide if the issues are more severe. The fluency issues are more about spelling and minor grammar, so maybe a 3.5. Coherence has some logical flow but with some gaps in transitions, so maybe a 3.5 as well.
