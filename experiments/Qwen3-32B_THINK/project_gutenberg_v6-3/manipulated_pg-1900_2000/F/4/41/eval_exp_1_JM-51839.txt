Let me carefully analyze this text and identify issues with fluency and coherence.

# Fluency Issues

1) [SPELLING] "traditkon" - misspelled word
2) [SPELLING] "yhe" - misspelled word
3) [SPELLING] "dowh" - misspelled word
4) [SPELLING] "dexth" - misspelled word
5) [SPELLING] "wwre" - misspelled word
6) [SPELLING] "winfer" - misspelled word
7) [SPELLING] "searcb" - misspelled word
8) [SPELLING] "ov" - misspelled word
9) [SPELLING] "qgricultural" - misspelled word
10) [SPELLING] "ahd" - misspelled word
11) [SPELLING] "alreadg" - misspelled word
12) [SPELLING] "sefious" - misspelled word
13) [SPELLING] "yohng" - misspelled word
14) [SPELLING] "Spanizrds" - misspelled word

19) [SPELLING] "covic" - misspelled word
20) [SPELLING] "uncettain" - misspelled word
21) [SPELLING] "tkwn" - misspelled word
22) [SPELLING] "Philoppines" - misspelled word
23) [SPELLING] "in turn wascfollowed" - misspelled word
24) [SPELLING] "Frsnch" - misspelled word

There are a significant number of spelling errors throughout the text, which would affect fluency.

# Coherence Issues

I'll look for problems related to logical sequence, connected ideas, clear progression, and consistency.

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into chapters, but there's no clear introduction or conclusion that frames the historical narrative.
2) [LOGIC] The text jumps from a poetic chapter to a historical account without clear transition.
3) [LOGIC] The text moves from one historical event to another without clear connections or chronology.
4) [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin abruptly without clear indication of their relationship to the previous content.
5) [LOGIC] The text mentions various historical figures and events but doesn't establish a clear narrative thread.
6) [LOGIC] The text mentions multiple historical periods but doesn't clearly delineate or transition between them.
7) [LOGIC] The text discusses different tribes and their relationships but doesn't clearly establish their connections.
8) [LOGIC] The text mentions various locations and geographic references but doesn't always clarify their relationships.
9) [LOGIC] The text discusses different historical periods (pre-European contact, Spanish rule, etc.) but doesn't clearly indicate transitions between these periods.
10) [LOGIC] The text discusses various historical events (Philip Nolan's expedition, etc.) but doesn't clearly establish their significance within the overall narrative.

The text has a clear historical focus but lacks a coherent structure that would guide the reader through the narrative.

# Final Scores

For Fluency:
The text has numerous spelling errors that would affect readability. These are not minor issues but rather frequent and noticeable. According to the scale, this would fall in the lower range for fluency. I would rate it a 2.5 - the text has frequent errors that make comprehension difficult in places, though some segments are clear.

For Coherence:
The text attempts to tell a historical narrative but lacks clear organization, transitions, and logical progression. While there is a general chronological order, the connections between ideas and events are often unclear. I would rate it a 3 - generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.

So my final assessment is:
Fluency: 2.5
Coherence: 3
