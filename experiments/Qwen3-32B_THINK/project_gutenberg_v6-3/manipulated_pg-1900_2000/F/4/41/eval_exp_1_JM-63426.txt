Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

# Fluency Issues:
1) [SPELLING] "thecopening" should be "the opening"
2) [SPELLING] "xoor" should be "door"
3) [SPELLING] "hasn’y" should be "hasn't"
4) [SPELLING] "msdievalism" should be "medievalism"
5) [SPELLING] "avant garde" should be "avant-garde" (with a hyphen)
6) [SPELLING] "Cwzanne" should be "Cézanne"
7) [SPELLING] "Americw" should be "America"
8) [SPELLING] "knowm" should be "known"
9) [SPELLING] "anothernway" should be "another way"
10) [SPELLING] "hadmset" should be "had set"
11) [SPELLING] "tield" should be "field"
12) [SPELLING] "oud" should be "our"
13) [SPELLING] "ij" should be "in"
14) [SPELLING] "chuckping" should be "chuckling"
15) [SPELLING] "fone" should be "gone"
16) [SPELLING] "glod" should be "good"
17) [SPELLING] "lifttle" should be "little"
18) [SPELLING] "yhe" should be "the"
19) [SPELLING] "scnool" should be "school"
20) [SPELLING] "pigtaols" should be "pigtails"
21) [SPELLING] "hevis" should be "he is"
22) [SPELLING] "uim" should be "him"
23) [SPELLING] "second yearbin school" should be "second year in school"
24) [SPELLING] "w" should be "a"
25) [SPELLING] "Eveey" should be "Every"
26) [SPELLING] "Fhe" should be "The"
27) [SPELLING] "seven xnd" should be "seven and"

# Coherence Issues:
1) [LOGIC] The text jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions
2) [STRUCTURE] The narrative is disjointed, with many abrupt shifts between different topics and events in Bradley's life
3) [LOGIC] The connection between the introduction and the main narrative is somewhat unclear
4) [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are very long and contain multiple ideas without clear organization
5) [LOGIC] The flow of events in Bradley's life is not always clearly chronological
6) [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt or missing
7) [LOGIC] Some cause-and-effect relationships are not clearly explained

Now, let's score based on the criteria:

For Fluency:
The text has numerous spelling errors (around 27) that would make it difficult to read smoothly. These errors would significantly impact the fluency. However, the text is otherwise well-structured with clear sentences and a logical flow within paragraphs. The errors are primarily spelling-related rather than grammatical or syntactic issues. Given the number of spelling errors and their impact on readability, I would score this as a 2.5 out of 5 for fluency.

For Coherence:
The text tells a story about Will Bradley's life and career, and there is a general chronological flow. However, there are significant issues with the logical sequencing of events, abrupt transitions, and lack of clear organization in some paragraphs. The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without sufficient transition, and some cause-and-effect relationships are not clearly explained. While the overall narrative is somewhat coherent, the issues with structure and transitions affect the readability and flow. I would score this as a 3 out of 5 for coherence.
