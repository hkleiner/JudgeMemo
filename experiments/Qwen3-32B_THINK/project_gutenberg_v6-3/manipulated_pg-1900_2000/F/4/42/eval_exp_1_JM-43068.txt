Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. Fluency refers to how smoothly and naturally the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll go through the text and identify any issues that might affect its fluency.

First, I'll look for grammatical errors. For example, I notice "betwixted" which should be "betwixt" (a word that means "between"). There's also "has come to occupy" which should be "has come to occupy" (but I'm not sure if that's an issue). Then there's "Formerly he is looked upon" which should be "Formerly he was looked upon" (subject-verb agreement). "An exhaustive research into his life and works have reveal" should be "has revealed" (subject-verb agreement). "Millet can was considered" should be "Millet can be considered" (incorrect verb form). "Only in Brittany and in La Vend√©e coulded one to-day encounter" should be "could one encounter" (incorrect verb form). "The end of the day has arrived, and after many hours of unremited toil" should be "unrelenting toil" (incorrect word). "The only softening influence in their lives is that imparted by religion" seems okay. "It must was remembered" should be "It must be remembered" (incorrect verb form). "He never bursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many of his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days" seems okay. "His manner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of timidity" seems okay. "By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a large and bold manner" seems okay. "But as his whole thoughts were directed to suppressed any tendencies towards virtuosity" should be "suppress any tendencies" (incorrect verb form). "Another dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he throws off his sadly philosophic mood, he was no longer a great artist" should be "he is no longer a great artist" (incorrect verb form). "The smallest duty which would have left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject of many a fine canvas" should be "has made the subject" (incorrect verb form). "He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in the sky" seems okay. "How the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are tinged with opalescent hues" seems okay. "How the orb sinks deeper and deeper" seems okay. "The whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory" seems okay.

Now for coherence. Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text flow and connect to each other. I'll look for logical sequencing, clear transitions, and overall structure. The text starts by introducing Millet as a painter of peasant life, then discusses Brueghel the Elder, the Dutch school, and how Millet relates to them. It then moves to the changes in European society and how they affected the depiction of peasant life. The text then discusses Millet's style, his influences, and specific paintings like "Angelus" and "La Baigneuse." It concludes with his philosophy and the impact of his work. The flow seems logical, but there are a few places where the transitions could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing Brueghel to the Dutch school is somewhat abrupt. Also, the discussion of "La Baigneuse" seems a bit out of place compared to the rest of the text. Additionally, the text sometimes jumps between different aspects of Millet's work without clear transitions. For instance, after discussing "The Sheep Pen," the text ends with a description of the shepherd's thoughts without connecting back to the main theme.

In terms of fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and word choice issues that would disrupt the flow for a reader. The coherence is generally good, but there are a few places where the logical flow and transitions could be improved.
