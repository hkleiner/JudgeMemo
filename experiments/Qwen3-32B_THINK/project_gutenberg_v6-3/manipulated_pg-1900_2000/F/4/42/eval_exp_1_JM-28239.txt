Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues.

First, looking at fluency. The text is a historical narrative about Kentucky's history. I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

I notice some verbs are in the wrong tense. For example, "come to Canada" should be "came". Also, "have been exhumed" is correct, but "am found" is incorrect; it should be "are found". There are a few missing articles, like "a passage to the South Sea" instead of "the passage". Some sentences are a bit long and could be split for clarity. For example, the sentence starting with "Crossing the St. Lawrence..." is quite long. There's also a missing comma before "and" in "formed by these two small rivers and now known as the Ohio". 

Now for coherence. The text is structured into chapters, which is good, but I need to check the logical flow and transitions between sections. The chapters are about geography, early visitors, Daniel Boone, settlements, and pioneer life. Each chapter seems to follow the previous one in a chronological order, which is logical. However, some parts might have abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from discussing the first white visitor to Daniel Boone might feel a bit sudden. Also, the mention of "The Long Hunter" and the details about Simon Kenton's love affair are specific but could be better integrated into the broader narrative. 

Another coherence issue is the mention of events like the Revolutionary War battle at Lexington, Massachusetts, and then immediately switching to a camp in Kentucky named Lexington. The connection might be clear, but it's a bit jarring. Also, some details, like the naming of St. Asaph’s spring, are specific but might not tie into the main narrative as smoothly. 

In terms of repetition, the text mentions the importance of springs multiple times, which is relevant but could be more clearly connected each time. There are also some minor inconsistencies, like "the Ohio and Mississippi valleys" vs. "the Ohio, Mississippi and Kentucky rivers" which might confuse the reader slightly. 

Overall, the fluency has several grammatical and syntactical issues that affect readability, but the text is still mostly understandable. Coherence is good with a logical structure, though some transitions and specific details could be smoother. I'll now rate each metric based on the scales provided.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense: "come to Canada" should be "came".  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement: "No permanent Indian villages am found" should be "are found".  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article: "a passage to the South Sea" (should be "the passage").  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence: Long sentence starting with "Crossing the St. Lawrence..." lacks clarity.  
- [SPELLING] "woulded have to be launched" (incorrect word choice).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma before "and" in "formed by these two small rivers and now known as the Ohio".  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from "first white visitor" to Daniel Boone without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt mention of "Simon Kenton's love affair" with unclear relevance to broader narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Jarring connection between Revolutionary War battle in Massachusetts and Kentucky's Lexington.  
- [CLARITY] Disjointed reference to "St. Asaph’s" spring without clear narrative integration.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent phrasing: "the Ohio and Mississippi valleys" vs. "the Ohio, Mississippi and Kentucky rivers".  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
