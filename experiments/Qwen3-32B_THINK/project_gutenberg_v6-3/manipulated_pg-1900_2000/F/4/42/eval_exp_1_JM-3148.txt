Let me evaluate the text according to the fluency and coherence criteria:

**Fluency Issues:**

1) [GRAMMAR] - "The schools was sad and slow" - The verb "was" should be "were" to agree with the plural subject "schools"
2) [GRAMMAR] - "He had satisfy himself" - The verb should be "satisfied" to match the past tense context
3) [GRAMMAR] - "He should have more housework to do than ever" - The verb "have" should be "had" to maintain past tense consistency
4) [GRAMMAR] - "He had am exactly like" - This appears to be a missing verb; it should be "He had been exactly like"
5) [GRAMMAR] - "one fact that woulded yield" - The verb should be "would yield"
6) [GRAMMAR] - "He could never study when a fly buzz on the window-pane" - The verb should be "buzzed"
7) [GRAMMAR] - "He was always stood on the toes" - The verb should be "standing"
8) [GRAMMAR] - "He would tied one end of a thread" - The verb should be "tie"
9) [GRAMMAR] - "If any one have ever given him a task" - The verb should be "had given"
10) [GRAMMAR] - "Tony have more useless information" - The verb should be "had"

These are some of the most significant grammatical issues that affect fluency. There are other minor issues with punctuation and capitalization that don't significantly impact fluency as much as these grammatical errors do.

**Coherence Issues:**

1) [STRUCTURE] - The narrative jumps between different scenes and time periods without clear transitions
2) [LOGIC] - The story introduces multiple characters (Davy, Uncle Tony, Squire Bean) without fully establishing their relationships
3) [CLARITY] - Some descriptions are overly detailed and could be confusing to readers (e.g., the description of Anthony's childhood imagination)
4) [LOGIC] - The story shifts from a specific anecdote about Davy reading to Uncle Tony to a broader narrative about Anthony's childhood without clear connection
5) [TRANSITION] - The transition from the present scene with Davy and Uncle Tony to Anthony's childhood is abrupt

The text does maintain a general narrative flow and has a clear central character (Anthony Croft), but there are some logical jumps and transitions that could be smoother. The story is mostly coherent but has some noticeable issues that interrupt the flow.

Based on these observations:

**Fluency Score:** I would rate this at 3.5. The text has multiple grammatical errors that affect readability and flow, but it's still generally understandable. The errors are not so severe as to make the text difficult to comprehend, but they are frequent enough to be distracting.

**Coherence Score:** I would rate this at 4. The text has a clear narrative and logical progression for the most part, but there are some noticeable shifts and transitions that could be smoother. The story is generally coherent but has a few weak spots in its structure and transitions between scenes.

Let me double-check my assessment and make sure I'm not missing anything:

The text is a narrative with a clear beginning (introducing Davy and Uncle Tony) and then shifts to a broader story about Anthony Croft's childhood. The narrative does have a logical progression, but the transition between the specific scene and the broader narrative could be smoother. The grammatical issues are significant but not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand.

My final scores remain:
Fluency: 3.5
Coherence: 4

- [GRAMMAR] "He would tied one end of a thread" (tense inconsistency)
- [GRAMMAR] "If any one have ever given him a task" (tense inconsistency)
- [GRAMMAR] "Tony have more useless information" (tense inconsistency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt narrative jumps between different scenes and time periods
- [LOGIC] Unclear relationships between introduced characters
