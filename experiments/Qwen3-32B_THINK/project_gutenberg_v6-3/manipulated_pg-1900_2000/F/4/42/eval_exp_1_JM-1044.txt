Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand its content and structure.

The text is an excerpt from "Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven" and is written in a humorous and satirical style. The narrative follows Captain Stormfield as he travels through space after death, comparing his journey to that of comets and eventually arriving at Heaven, where he encounters confusion about his origin.

### Fluency Issues:
Looking at fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

- [GRAMMAR] "warn’t" is an archaic contraction of "was not," which might be stylistic but could be considered non-standard.
- [GRAMMAR] "I begun to get a little anxious" uses "begun" instead of "began" (past tense).
- [GRAMMAR] "I judged I was going about a million miles a minute—it might have been more, it couldn’t had been less" has a tense inconsistency with "couldn’t had."
- [GRAMMAR] "we’ved" is a contraction of "we have," but should be "we’ve."
- [GRAMMAR] "I was pointed as straight as a dart for the Hereafter; but I happened on one every now and then that was going my way for an hour or so" has a missing comma after "Hereafter."
- [GRAMMAR] "I could see by the shape of him that I hadn’t even got up to his waistband yet" uses "him" to refer to a comet, which is personification but not grammatically incorrect.
- [GRAMMAR] "You’ved get to go" should be "You’ve got to go."
- [GRAMMAR] "I’ve seen comets out there that couldn’t even lay down inside the orbits of our noblest comets without their tails hanging over" has a missing comma after "orbits."
- [GRAMMAR] "I found out, over there, that a kazark is exactly the bulk of a hundred and sixty-nine worlds like ours!" has a comma splice.

### Coherence Issues:
For coherence, I need to assess the logical progression, clarity, transitions, and overall structure.

- [LOGIC] The narrative abruptly shifts from the comet race to the captain of the comet and his actions without clear transition.
- [LOGIC] The concept of a "kazark" is introduced without explanation, which might confuse readers.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from the comet race to Captain Stormfield's arrival at Heaven with minimal transition.
- [CLARITY] The dialogue between Captain Stormfield and the clerks in Heaven is disjointed and lacks clear progression.
- [LOGIC] The confusion about the origin of San Francisco, California, and America is repetitive and could be clearer.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative ends abruptly with the head clerk's question, leaving the story unresolved.

### Final Scores:
- **Fluency**: The text has several grammatical errors, some tense inconsistencies, and a few punctuation issues. However, the style is archaic and humorous, which might be intentional. The errors are noticeable but don't severely hinder understanding. I would rate it a 3.5.
- **Coherence**: The narrative has logical jumps, some unclear transitions, and unresolved parts. The structure is somewhat disjointed, especially between the comet race and the Heaven scene. However, the overall story is readable. I would rate it a 3.
