Alright, let's start by looking at the text. It's a historical narrative about the Siege of Petersburg during the American Civil War. The text is structured into several chapters, each covering different aspects of the campaign. I need to assess it for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
I'll start by looking for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues.

1. **[GRAMMAR] "So far not one had succeeded in destroyed Lee’s army or in capturing Richmond."** - The verb "destroyed" should be in the infinitive form "to destroy."

2. **[GRAMMAR] "was situate on the southern bank..."** - "Situate" should be "situated."

3. **[GRAMMAR] "woulded almost certainly lead to the abandonment of Richmond."** - "Woulded" is incorrect; it should be "would."

4. **[GRAMMAR] "give to Petersburg a significance out of all proportion to its size."** - The verb "give" should be "gave."

5. **[GRAMMAR] "have threatened Richmond from the east and southeast..."** - The verb "have" should be "had" to maintain past tense consistency.

6. **[GRAMMAR] "work continue until its completion about a year later."** - "Continue" should be "continued."

7. **[GRAMMAR] "The very length and size of the fortifications proved to be a disadvantage."** - This sentence is grammatically correct, but I'm including it as an example of a potential issue if it were problematic.

8. **[SPELLING] "straining war effort" - "straining" is correctly spelled.**

9. **[PUNCTUATION] "It was the railroads more than the highways, however, which give to Petersburg a significance out of all proportion to its size."** - The comma placement after "however" is correct, but the verb tense is incorrect.

10. **[PUNCTUATION] "The transportation vehicles of the 1860’s did not require the wide, straight highways of the present. However, several good roads came into the city..."** - The transition from "However" at the beginning of a new sentence is correct.

**Coherence Issues:**
Now I'll look at the logical flow, structure, and transitions between ideas.

1. **[STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the transition between "PROLOGUE" and "UNION STRATEGY 1864" is abrupt.** The prologue provides background on the Civil War, but there's no clear transition to the specific strategy of 1864.

2. **[LOGIC] The text mentions "Union Movements" and "Confederate Movements" with a list of battles, but doesn't clearly explain how these movements relate to the overall strategy or the events that follow.** The list seems disconnected from the surrounding text.

3. **[LOGIC] In the "UNION STRATEGY 1864" chapter, it states "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg."** This is confusing - it's not clear what the "upper arm" refers to or how it relates to the previous sentence.

4. **[LOGIC] The text mentions "The story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told" but then goes into a detailed account of Butler's movements.** This creates a contradiction between what is promised and what is delivered.

5. **[LOGIC] In the "STRATEGIC PETERSBURG" chapter, it states "Petersburg was a road and rail center of vital importance to the Confederacy, and its capture woulded almost certainly lead to the abandonment of Richmond."** The connection between capturing Petersburg and the abandonment of Richmond is not clearly explained.

6. **[LOGIC] The text mentions "the very length and size of the fortifications proved to be a disadvantage" but doesn't clearly explain why this was a disadvantage or how it affected the strategy.**

7. **[LOGIC] In the "BATTLE OF PETERSBURG" chapter, it states "Eighteen thousand Union soldiers were on their way to face less than 4,000 under Beauregard."** This creates a numerical imbalance that is not explained in the context of the battle.

8. **[STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of the campaign without clear transitions.** For example, it moves from the strategic importance of Petersburg to the construction of the "Dimmock Line" without a clear connection.

9. **[LOGIC] The text mentions "The damage done by such raids was quickly patched up, but they were a constant nuisance to the city’s transportation lines."** It's not clear how this relates to the previous discussion of the Dimmock Line.

10. **[LOGIC] The text states "To shut off permanently the supplies that streamed along the railroads, the Union forces would have to take permanent physical possession of them."** This is a logical point, but it's not clearly connected to the preceding discussion about raids and repairs.

Now, I'll determine the scores for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors that would distract a reader. However, the majority of the text is still readable and the meaning is generally clear despite these issues. The errors are not so frequent or severe as to make the text difficult to understand. I would rate this as a 3.5 on the fluency scale.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a clear structure with chapters that follow a logical sequence. However, there are several issues with the flow of ideas and transitions between sections. Some of the connections between concepts are not clearly explained, and there are occasional abrupt shifts in focus. While the overall narrative is generally coherent, these issues affect the reading experience. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "So far not one had succeeded in destroyed Lee’s army" (incorrect verb form) - [GRAMMAR] "was situate on the southern bank" (incorrect adjective form) - [GRAMMAR] "woulded almost certainly lead to the abandonment of Richmond" (incorrect verb form) - [GRAMMAR] "give to Petersburg a significance out of all proportion to its size" (incorrect verb form) - [GRAMMAR] "in the spring of 1862, McClellan’s Peninsular Campaign have threatened" (incorrect verb tense) - [GRAMMAR] "work continue until its completion about a year later" (incorrect verb form)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg" (unclear reference to "upper arm") - [LOGIC] "The story of the Army of the James... can be briefly told" followed by detailed account (contradiction) - [LOGIC] "The connection between capturing Petersburg and the abandonment of Richmond is not clearly explained" - [LOGIC] "Eighteen thousand Union soldiers were on their way to face less than 4,000 under Beauregard" (numerical imbalance not explained) - [STRUCTURE] "The text jumps between different aspects of the campaign without clear transitions" - [LOGIC] "The damage done by such raids was quickly patched up, but they were a constant nuisance" (relationship to Dimmock Line not clear)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
