Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

For fluency, I need to look for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

For coherence, I need to look for issues with logical sequencing, transitions between ideas, consistency, and overall organization.

After reading through the text carefully, here are my observations:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] "give an opportunity to the Germans to regain" - The verb tense is inconsistent with the earlier part of the sentence that mentions "the invention of printing books" in the past tense.
2. [GRAMMAR] "the beginning of the end was on them" - This is awkward phrasing and not grammatically correct.
3. [GRAMMAR] "the names under which the Ulm and Augsburg picture-books are know" - "know" should be "known".
4. [SPELLING] "mediæval" - This is an archaic spelling that might be considered incorrect in modern usage.
5. [SPELLING] "closes the series of the Ulm books" - "closes" should be "closes" but the issue is that the article "the" is repeated unnecessarily.
6. [SPELLING] "closes the series of the Ulm books" - The repetition of "the" is unnecessary.
7. [SPELLING] "closes the series of the Ulm books" - There's a missing comma after "books" in the next sentence.
8. [SPELLING] "the shield of Scotland supported by angels in the corner" - Missing comma after "corner".
9. [GRAMMAR] "Zainer's books , e.g., in the 1473 and 1474 editions" - There's an extra space before the comma after "books".
10. [GRAMMAR] "is often use and is clearly founded" - "use" should be "used".
11. [GRAMMAR] "the fifteenth century betrays itself in certain details, chiefly in the sharp foliations at the ends of the scrolls, etc." - "etc." should be spelled out as "etcetera" in formal writing.
12. [GRAMMAR] "the press-work not being so good as it should have been" - "should have been" is correct, but the sentence structure is awkward.
13. [SPELLING] "c. 1471" - The abbreviation "c." should be spelled out as "circa" in formal writing.
14. [SPELLING] "c. 1474" - Same issue with the abbreviation "c."
15. [SPELLING] "c. 1474" - There's a missing space after the period in "c."
16. [GRAMMAR] "the press-work not being so good as it should have been even when printed by the weak presses of the fifteenth century" - This is a long, complex sentence with awkward structure.
17. [SPELLING] "coulded was simpler" - "coulded" is incorrect; it should be "could".
18. [GRAMMAR] "if you please it" - This is awkward phrasing.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [STRUCTURE] The text is very dense with information and lacks clear organization or sectioning.
2. [LOGIC] The flow of information is sometimes confusing, jumping between different printers, books, and artistic styles without clear transitions.
3. [CLARITY] The text is highly specialized and assumes significant background knowledge about medieval and Renaissance printing.
4. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear topic sentences and paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the main points.
5. [LOGIC] The author makes comparisons between different printers and styles but doesn't always clearly establish the basis for these comparisons.
6. [CLARITY] Some terms like "border-pieces" and "pen-letters" are used without explanation for readers who may not be familiar with printing terminology.
7. [LOGIC] The author discusses the transition from early to later styles but doesn't always clearly define what constitutes this transition.
8. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different cities (Ulm and Augsburg) and different printers without clear transitions.
9. [CLARITY] The text uses many technical terms without explanation, making it less accessible to general readers.
10. [LOGIC] The author makes claims about the artistic merit of these books but doesn't always provide sufficient evidence or explanation to support these claims.

Now let me assign scores based on these observations:

For fluency, the text has several grammatical and spelling errors, as well as some awkward phrasing. However, the overall meaning is generally clear, and the errors don't significantly disrupt reading comprehension. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.

For coherence, the text is very dense with information and lacks clear organization. The flow of information is often confusing, and the author jumps between different printers, books, and artistic styles without clear transitions. The text is highly specialized and assumes significant background knowledge. I would rate this as a 3 - it's generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me double-check my assessment to make sure I'm not missing anything:

The fluency issues are primarily grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. These do make the text less smooth to read but don't render it incomprehensible. The coherence issues are more significant, as the text is difficult to follow due to its dense, unorganized nature and lack of clear transitions between topics.

Based on my analysis, my final scores would be:
- Fluency: 3.5
- Coherence: 3
