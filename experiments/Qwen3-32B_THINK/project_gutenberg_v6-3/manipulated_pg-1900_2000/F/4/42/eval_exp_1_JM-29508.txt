Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how well the text reads with attention to grammar, syntax, spelling, and punctuation.

First, I'll look for any grammatical issues. I notice several instances where the verb "was" is incorrectly used instead of "is". For example:
- "to was the ordering principles of societies"
- "and the rules was designed"
- "Without the coöperation there would was no competition"
- "and to grew weeds rather than flowers because weeds are more efficient"

These are clear grammatical errors that would distract a reader.

Next, I'll check for spelling issues. I see "Coöperation" is used consistently, which is correct, but it's an unusual spelling. I also notice "coöperation" and "coöperating" are used in the text. These are correct but uncommon spellings that might confuse some readers.

Looking at syntax and phrasing, I see some awkward phrasing:
- "It was in military, political, and religious organization that the power of associated effort was first shown."
- "Sometimes resisted the political, military, or ecclesiastical forces which were earlier in the lead"
- "It was not the work or possession of leaders alone, but embodies in varying degrees the work and active interest of all."

These sentences could be more clearly phrased to improve readability.

There are also some punctuation issues:
- Missing commas in complex sentences
- Missing periods between sentences that should be separate

Now, for coherence, I'll assess the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is about the ethics of cooperation and compares it with dominance and competition. The structure seems logical with clear sections on each topic. However, there are a few places where the flow could be improved:
- The transition from discussing dominance to competition could be smoother.
- Some concepts are introduced and then not fully developed before moving on.
- There are some abrupt shifts in topic within paragraphs.

Overall, the text presents a clear argument and maintains a logical progression, but there are minor issues with transitions and flow that could be improved.

Let me now summarize the fluency issues:
1. Grammatical errors with "was" instead of "is"
2. Inconsistent verb tenses
3. Awkward phrasing in some sentences
4. Punctuation issues

For coherence:
1. Minor abrupt transitions between sections
2. Some concepts introduced without sufficient development
3. Slightly disjointed flow in a few paragraphs

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5 and coherence as a 4. The text is generally readable and has a logical structure, but the grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in fluency issues make it less than ideal, while the coherence is good but has some minor issues with flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "was" instead of "is" (e.g., "to was the ordering principles", "and the rules was designed", "Without the coöperation there would was no competition")  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "Masters of the past have offer many such")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "It was in military, political, and religious organization that the power of associated effort was first shown")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex clauses (e.g., "Sometimes resisted the political, military, or ecclesiastical forces which were earlier in the lead, sometimes mastering them, sometimes combining with them")  
- [SPELLING] Unusual spelling of "coöperation" (not incorrect but may cause confusion for some readers)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between abstract concepts and concrete examples (e.g., moving from philosophical definitions to examples of sport and business competition)  
- [LOGIC] Ambiguous connections between dominance, competition, and cooperation in some paragraphs  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs (e.g., "But aside from the formulations of philosophers" begins a new section without clear linkage to the prior discussion)  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense phrasing in some sections (e.g., "The purpose of the joint pursuit in organization characterized by dominance may be either the exclusive good of the master or the joint good of the whole organized group")  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
