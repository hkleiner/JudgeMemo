Let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues according to the given criteria.

## Fluency Issues

Looking for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation problems:

1. [GRAMMAR] "It is generally assumed that fast coaching only come into existence" - "come" should be "came" (subject-verb agreement issue)
2. [GRAMMAR] "so it must had run at the rate of 12 miles an hour all the time it was travelling" - should be "must have run"
3. [GRAMMAR] "neither was any part of his harness to was depended on, upon a pinch" - grammatical structure is confusing and incorrect
4. [GRAMMAR] "He could untie a knot with his teeth and tied another with his tongue" - inconsistent verb tense
5. [GRAMMAR] "In short, he could do what coachmen of the present day cannot do" - "In short" should be "In short"
6. [GRAMMAR] "Took the following:--" - incorrect verb form; should be "Take the following"
7. [GRAMMAR] "He appears to have driven on to the bank by the roadside" - missing preposition
8. [GRAMMAR] "the coachman himself had both legs break" - should be "both legs broken"
9. [GRAMMAR] "the coachman ran against a heavy country cart" - missing preposition
10. [GRAMMAR] "It would be easy to compile a list of accidents due to causes unforeseen" - "unforseen" is misspelled
11. [SPELLING] "unforseen" - misspelled as "unforseen"
12. [SPELLING] "become" - misspelled as "become" (used twice)
13. [SPELLING] "recovered" - misspelled as "recovered"
14. [SPELLING] "dickey" - should be "dickey" but might be an archaic term that's spelled correctly
15. [SPELLING] "fall" - misspelled as "fall"

## Coherence Issues

Looking for logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities, and consistent structure:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions
2. [LOGIC] The text presents a series of historical events and anecdotes without a clear narrative thread or organizational principle
3. [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and complex, making it difficult to follow the meaning
4. [TRANSITION] The text often moves from one anecdote to another without clear connections
5. [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory information without explanation (e.g., praising coachmen while also showing their recklessness)
6. [STRUCTURE] The text uses quotation marks inconsistently, sometimes for direct quotes and sometimes for titles
7. [LOGIC] The text presents statistics and anecdotes without clear context or significance
8. [CLARITY] Some historical references and terms may be unclear to modern readers without explanation
9. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction or conclusion that ties the content together
10. [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information in a non-chronological order

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency:
The text has multiple grammatical errors and some spelling issues, but it's generally readable and the meaning is clear. The errors don't completely disrupt comprehension but are noticeable. This aligns with a score of 3.

For Coherence:
The text has significant coherence issues with abrupt shifts between topics, lack of clear narrative structure, and disconnected ideas. While the content is about a specific topic (stage coaches and coachmen), the presentation is disorganized and lacks logical flow. This aligns with a score of 3.

Let me finalize my assessment:
