## COHERENCE ANALYSIS:

Looking for logical sequencing, smooth connections, and overall narrative structure:

1. [STRUCTURE] The story has a clear beginning and end, but there are some abrupt transitions between scenes.
2. [LOGIC] The story is generally logical, but some plot points are unclear (e.g., why Ramsey is wanted by Earth, the specifics of the planetarization).
3. [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or could be smoother.
4. [CLARITY] Some concepts are not clearly explained (e.g., the process of hyper-space travel, the political context of planetarization).
5. [CHARACTERIZATION] Some character motivations are not fully explained (e.g., why Ramsey helps Englander).
6. [PLOT] The overall plot is clear, but there are some loose ends (e.g., the Earthgirl who leaves the ship, the drunk Irwadian at the end).
7. [TIMELINE] The timeline is generally clear, but there are some unclear time references (e.g., "last month" without context).
8. [NARRATIVE FLOW] The narrative flow is generally good, but some parts feel rushed or underdeveloped.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the text for fluency and coherence.

For fluency, the text has multiple spelling and grammatical errors that would distract a reader. These errors are frequent enough to affect readability but not so severe that the text is completely unintelligible. This would place it at a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence, the text has a clear narrative with a logical progression. While there are some loose ends and unclear plot points, the overall structure is coherent and the story is generally easy to follow. This would place it at a 4 on the coherence scale.
