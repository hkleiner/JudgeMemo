Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency. Fluency issues mainly relate to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

First, I'll scan through the text. I notice some grammatical errors. For example, in the sentence "He was president of the local board of education, he invited me to go out to their school building," the comma splice is a problem. Also, "We found the janitor busily engage in arranging the seats" should be "engaged." 

Looking further, there are instances where subject-verb agreement is incorrect. For example, "The situation that confronted me... can be illustrated by the experiences of two young men who enter the teaching profession..." The verb "enter" should be "entered" to match the past tense. 

Another issue is the use of "am" instead of "are" or "is" in some places. For instance, "county school board meetings that am held during the summer months." That should be "are held." There's also a missing apostrophe in "I was force to stop over" which should be "forced."

There are also some awkward phrasings, like "It was interesting to note his idea of the teaching profession as contrasted with that of a young woman who had interviewed me a short time before concerning a possible opening in one of the high schools." The word "concerning" could be replaced with "regarding" for better flow, but it's not a major issue. 

I also notice some missing commas where needed, like in the sentence "I guess our superintendent is more interested in something else than he is in his job here." The phrase "something else than" should be "something else than he is in his job here," which is correct, but the comma after "else" might help with clarity. 

Moving on to coherence. The text tells a story about the author's entry into teaching and two contrasting examples of teachers. The overall structure is logical, with chapters on entering the profession and getting a position. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after the first story about the president of the board, the text jumps to the second young man without a smooth transition. 

The two stories are presented as examples to illustrate the author's point, but the connection between them isn't clearly explained. The reader might not immediately see how the two contrasting examples support the main argument. 

Another issue is the repetition of certain ideas. The author emphasizes the importance of preparation and personality, but these points are mentioned in both chapters, which could lead to redundancy. 

There's also a lack of clear conclusion in the final chapter. The text ends with the story of the young woman and the man seeking a promotion, but it doesn't tie back to the main themes as strongly as it could. 

In terms of coherence, the text is generally organized, but the transitions between sections and the integration of examples could be smoother. The two contrasting examples are effective, but their connection to the overall message is not as clear as it could be. 

For the fluency score, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but they don't completely disrupt understanding. I would give a score around 3.5. 

For coherence, the structure is logical but has some abrupt transitions and unclear connections between examples. I would rate it a 3.5 as well.
