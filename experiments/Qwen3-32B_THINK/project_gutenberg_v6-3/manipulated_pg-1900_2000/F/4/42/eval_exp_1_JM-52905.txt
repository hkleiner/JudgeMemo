Alright, let's assess this text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll look at fluency. Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice a few issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues: "There is that dreadful fox again" should be "There is that dreadful fox again" (correct), but "Now everybody don’t get scared" should be "Now everybody doesn’t get scared".
- [GRAMMAR] Tense consistency: "But something had happened while he have been gone" should be "But something had happened while he had been gone".
- [GRAMMAR] Verb form: "reply Danny Fox" should be "replied Danny Fox".
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement: "Danny Fox laughed, but not very loud. He didn’t want the Farmer’s Boy to hear him. “Never fear, my dear. I’ve rolled a great big stone against the front door." (This is okay, but "I’ve rolled" might be better as "I have rolled" for formality).
- [GRAMMAR] Verb form: "say Danny Fox" should be "said Danny Fox".
- [SPELLING] "Sic’em" is a consistent spelling throughout the text.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some places, like after "Oh, my no!" or "Oh, my no!".
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing quotation marks at the beginning of some dialogue.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing periods at the end of some sentences.

Now for coherence. Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, including logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Looking at the text:
- [LOGIC] The story progresses logically with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The characters and their actions are consistent.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured with clear chapters and a narrative arc.
- [CLARITY] The narrative is generally clear and easy to follow.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters are smooth and logical.

However, there are a few minor issues:
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are a bit unclear or awkward: "He didn’t want the Farmer’s Boy to hear him. “Never fear, my dear. I’ve rolled a great big stone against the front door." The transition between these thoughts is a bit abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions "Mr. John Rabbit" but later refers to "Mrs. Rabbit" - this is inconsistent.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent and coherent with only a few minor issues that don't significantly impact the reading experience.

For the fluency score, I would rate it a 4. It's mostly fluent with only a few minor grammatical issues that don't disrupt the overall readability.

For the coherence score, I would rate it a 4.5. It's highly coherent with a clear and logical progression throughout. There are only a few minor lapses that are barely noticeable and don't hinder understanding.
