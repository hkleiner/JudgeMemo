Alright, let's take a look at this text and evaluate it based on the fluency and coherence criteria.

# Fluency Assessment

Looking for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** "Three facts relating to this locality--and three only--seem to be prove as ante-dating the commencement of that printed story." - The verb "prove" should be "proven" or "proved" in this context.

2. **[GRAMMAR]** "And that, at the time of this annual Sacrifice, the tribes from far and near assembled at Niagara, there to worship the Great Spirit." - The sentence structure is awkward with the placement of "there."

3. **[GRAMMAR]** "If this Legend is based on fact, it would certainly have made the locality a famous place of annual rendezvous; and at such a rendezvous the opportunities for the exchange of many and varied commodities--"trade"--would surely not have been neglected." - The sentence is long and complex with improper punctuation between the two parts.

4. **[GRAMMAR]** "The Legend of Healing is, that anyone, Brave or Squaw, if ill, would quickly be restored to perfect health could they but reached the base of the Falls..." - The structure is awkward and the conditional is improperly formed.

5. **[GRAMMAR]** "If this Legend was founded on fact, it certainly woulded have made Niagara at that time one of the best known..." - "Woulded" is incorrect; it should be "would have."

6. **[SPELLING]** "It is possible to-day, as it most certainly was in those traditional days..." - "to-day" is an archaic spelling that should be "today."

7. **[SYNTAX]** "It is possible to see a complete circular Rainbow anywhere, on land or water, whenever one stands between the Sun and a sufficiently abundant mist (standing close to the latter), and the Sun is near the horizon." - The sentence structure is confusing and the parentheses interrupt the flow.

8. **[SYNTAX]** "It is also observable from the rocks beyond and below Terrapin Point, on the Goat Island side of the Horse-Shoe Fall; but the climb out to that point is both arduous and dangerous, and is very rarely attempted." - The sentence is complex and could be split for better clarity.

9. **[SYNTAX]** "No such phenomenon can be seen from the Canadian shore, because there are no rocks out in front of that end of the Horse-Shoe Fall on which one can stand." - The sentence is unnecessarily long and could be simplified.

10. **[GRAMMAR]** "Professor Tyndall, with Barlow as his guide, make an exhaustive study..." - The verb "make" should be "made."

11. **[GRAMMAR]** "It is more likely to have am one of those fearless and hardy men..." - The verb "am" is incorrect in this context.

12. **[GRAMMAR]** "Brule was the first Frenchman know to have joined the savages..." - "Know" should be "known."

13. **[GRAMMAR]** "He spent years amongst them, is a woodsman or trader..." - The verb "is" should be "was" or "was becoming."

14. **[PUNCTUATION]** The text frequently uses em dashes (--), which are not consistently used and sometimes disrupt the flow.

15. **[PUNCTUATION]** The text has some inconsistent punctuation in quoted passages.

16. **[LEXICON]** The word "Savages" is in quotes and capitalized, which is unusual and could be stylistically inconsistent.

17. **[LEXICON]** The word "Onguiaahras" is likely a specific term that may not be commonly recognized or spelled correctly.

18. **[LEXICON]** The text uses archaic language like "Squaw" and "Brave" which may not be appropriate or consistent with modern terminology.

19. **[PUNCTUATION]** The text uses excessive parentheses, which can interrupt the flow of reading.

20. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The text is generally readable but contains several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and complex sentence structures that affect the overall fluency.

# Coherence Assessment

Looking for issues in logical sequence, connected ideas, progression from one section to another, and overall narrative structure:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps between different legends and topics without clear transitions.

2. **[LOGIC]** The text presents legends as if they are facts, then later questions their authenticity, which can be confusing.

3. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes introduces new concepts without sufficient explanation or context.

4. **[CLARITY]** The text occasionally uses complex sentence structures that make the meaning unclear.

5. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between paragraphs and chapters are abrupt and lack smooth connections.

6. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes contradicts itself (e.g., presenting legends as if they are factual, then questioning their authenticity).

7. **[CLARITY]** The text uses archaic language and terms without explanation, which can make it difficult for modern readers to understand.

8. **[STRUCTURE]** The text's organization is somewhat disjointed, with related information scattered throughout.

9. **[LOGIC]** The text sometimes introduces new ideas without connecting them to previous information.

10. **[CLARITY]** The text uses specific terms and names (like "Onguiaahras") without sufficient explanation.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 3. The text has a general structure but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me finalize my ratings:

Fluency: 3.5
Coherence: 3
