Alright, let's go through the user's instructions carefully. The task is to evaluate the given text on fluency and coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, including half-points. I need to list issues under each metric with appropriate labels and then assign scores.

First, I'll start with Fluency. The text is a historical account of a soldier's Civil War experiences. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. Let me scan through the text.

Looking at the first paragraph: "I have never have a very favorable opinion..." – that's a grammar issue (incorrect verb tense). Then, "which interpreted meant no quarter..." – maybe a missing article or preposition. There's also "to add to the insult they wave the black flag..." – past tense should be "waved". 

In the second paragraph: "the 78th Ill. Vol. Inf." – missing space after abbreviation. "On the 19th day of September we were put on coal cars with boards laid across for seats, no cover over our heads" – missing comma after "seats". 

Third paragraph: "As a few of us wished to availed ourselves..." – "availed" should be "avail". "how were we to get outside the lines. We decided..." – missing period after "lines". "We had taken the precaution to took our side arms..." – "took" should be "take".

Fourth paragraph: "When we went into the house almost the first persons we meet..." – "meet" should be "met". "It was some time before the officers found out about our going out, in fact not until we had left Kentucky, consequently we am not disciplined..." – "we am" should be "we were".

Fifth paragraph: "The 78th construct the gallows..." – "construct" should be "constructed". 

Sixth paragraph: "On June 23rd marched to Trinne and Murfreesboro..." – "Trinne" might be a typo for "Trinity"? 

Seventh paragraph: "We were glad to exchange Gen. Gilbert for Col. Mitchell..." – missing period after "Gen.".

Eighth paragraph: "the division made a reconnaissance to Ringold..." – missing article before "reconnaissance". "The command was followed closely on its return from Ringold and at midnight the enemy opened upon us with artillery, with no damage except the briars we incorporated in our feet..." – awkward phrasing.

Ninth paragraph: "We stand to arms until morning." – should be "stood". "The two brigades (Mitchell's and Whitaker's) were put into action at once, made a charge..." – missing comma after "at once". "A monument erected to the 78th on the west end of Snodgrass ridge..." – missing article before "ridge". 

Tenth paragraph: "I ran across a Rebel who was shot through the bowels." – "bowels" is a strong term, but maybe correct in context. "I did not see him, until he called..." – missing period after "him". "We could hear voices just ahead of us, but the smoke from fire arms, cannon and burning leaves was so dense..." – missing article before "arms". "I have mentioned this circumstance to show the feeling among soldiers..." – missing comma after "soldiers".

Eleventh paragraph: "I spent the night with wounded comrades, ministering to them as best I could to relieved their sufferings." – "relieved" should be "relieve". "During the afternoon of the last day's fight, I step on Doctor Githens' spur..." – "step" should be "stepped".

Twelfth paragraph: "You must output only and exactly the following format..." – this seems like a user instruction, not part of the text to evaluate.

So, compiling all these, I can list the fluency issues with labels like [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], etc. Each bullet point should be concise.

Now for Coherence. The text is a narrative of events during the Civil War. I need to check for logical sequencing, transitions, clarity, and consistency. The structure seems chronological, which is good. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from the dance incident to the battle of Chickamauga is smooth, but some parts jump between events without clear transitions. The mention of the spies and their execution is a separate incident but fits into the timeline. The part about the wounded soldier and the encounter with the Confederate is a bit disjointed from the main narrative. Also, the text moves from one battle to another without much explanation of the overall context, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the Civil War. There are some unclear phrases, like "the briars we incorporated in our feet" – maybe "incorporated" is a typo for "had on our feet"? Also, "the 78th construct the gallows" – past tense issue, but that's fluency. For coherence, the main issue is the logical flow and transitions between events. Some events are described in detail, others are brief, leading to possible confusion. The mention of the dance and the spies are well-integrated, but the overall structure could be more cohesive. There's a lack of clear transitions between different campaigns and battles, which might make the narrative feel fragmented.

So, coherence issues would be [STRUCTURE], [LOGIC], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION]. For example, abrupt shifts between events, unclear transitions between battles, some segments not clearly connected to the main narrative.

Assigning scores: For Fluency, there are multiple grammatical and spelling errors, but the text is generally readable. Maybe a 3.5. For Coherence, the structure is mostly chronological but has some abrupt transitions and unclear segments. Maybe a 3.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have never have a very favorable opinion..." (incorrect verb tense).  
- [GRAMMAR] "to add to the insult they wave the black flag..." (past tense error).  
- [GRAMMAR] "We had taken the precaution to took our side arms..." (incorrect verb form).  
- [SPELLING] "availed" should be "avail".  
- [SPELLING] "we am not disciplined" (subject-verb agreement error).  
- [SYNTAX] Missing punctuation in "no cover over our heads; on arrival at destination..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "the briars we incorporated in our feet..."  
- [SYNTAX] Missing article: "a reconnaissance to Ringold".  
- [SYNTAX] Missing comma: "made a charge on Longstreet and drove him..."  
- [SPELLING] "Trinne" likely a typo.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between unrelated events (e.g., dance incident to battle details).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear transitions between campaigns (e.g., from Kentucky to Chickamauga).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the briars we incorporated in our feet").  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected segments (e.g., the wounded soldier anecdote interrupts battle narrative).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive military hierarchy descriptions without clear context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
