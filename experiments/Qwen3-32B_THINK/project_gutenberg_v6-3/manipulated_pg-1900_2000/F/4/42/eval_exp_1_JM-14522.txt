Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. 

Looking at the text, I notice a few grammatical errors. For example, "I feel bound to told you" should be "I feel bound to tell you." Another one is "he never ceased to regretted" which should be "he never ceased to regret." There's also "had qualify himself" which should be "had qualified himself." 

Then there's a missing apostrophe in "it's" in "it's the blood of Lady..." and "it's a form of European refinement." Also, "we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language." The word "really" here might be a redundancy or awkward phrasing.

For coherence, the text is a narrative that follows a logical sequence, but I need to check for transitions, clarity, and consistency. The story moves from the Otis family's arrival to the ghost's appearance, which is coherent. However, some parts might be confusing. For example, when the ghost is first mentioned, there's a detailed backstory, but when the ghost actually appears, it's a bit abrupt. The transition from the family's denial of ghosts to the ghost's appearance might be a bit jarring. Also, the description of the ghost's appearance and the Minister's reaction are clear, but the sudden action of the pillow whizzing by might be a bit unexpected without prior setup. 

I also need to check for any inconsistencies in the narrative. The story seems consistent in its setting and character actions. The family's reactions are in line with their established personalities. However, the part where the ghost is described in detail and then the Minister's reaction with the lubricator might be a bit humorous and could disrupt the tone if not handled well, but in the context of the story, it's intentional for comedic effect, so it's not a coherence issue.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent with some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. Coherence is good with a logical flow, but there are minor transitions that could be smoother.
