Let me carefully evaluate the text according to the criteria provided.

First, I'll assess the fluency of the text, looking for issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency issues I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] "One would imagine the water of Manila Bay to was as tranquil as a lake should conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position" - incorrect verb form "was" after "to"
- [GRAMMAR] "The men wore hat, shirt, and pants" - missing article before "hat"
- [GRAMMAR] "the upper end not being belted or tie, but just drawn tightly around the waist" - incorrect form "tie" should be "tied"
- [GRAMMAR] "Many of the women had in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tie with small white threads to hold them together" - "tie" should be "tied"
- [GRAMMAR] "Our underclothing coulded be drawn on only with difficulty" - "coulded" is incorrect form, should be "could be"
- [GRAMMAR] "When the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that he had named for his King Philip, build the city of Manila" - "build" should be "built"
- [GRAMMAR] "The strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth from the tower" - "pealing" should be "pealing" (correct spelling is "pealing")
- [GRAMMAR] "I mighted see the current of Manila's life when flowing at its height" - "mighted" is incorrect form, should be "might see"
- [PUNCTUATION] "The women wore a sort of low-necked body with great wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the same size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or tie, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part knotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped around the body." - long run-on sentence with multiple clauses that would benefit from punctuation breaks
- [PUNCTUATION] "There were Japanese, and East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all classes and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the seventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this wonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities." - inconsistent punctuation with the em-dash
- [PUNCTUATION] "the city 'intra muros' and the new city which had sprung up around it." - missing space between apostrophe and word in "intra muros"

Now I'll assess the coherence of the text, looking at logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clarity of ideas, and overall structure.

Coherence issues I notice:
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions (e.g., from the preface to the specific date in 1901, then to Honolulu, then to Manila)
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without clear connection to previous content
- [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure with a preface, then chapters, but the flow between these sections is not always smooth
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions are overly detailed and could be confusing (e.g., the lengthy description of Filipino women's clothing)
- [CLARITY] The narrative sometimes shifts perspective without clear indication (e.g., from the author's personal experience to general descriptions)
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the Bishop Museum to the description of surf-shooting in Hawaii is abrupt
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the historical account to the personal anecdote about the American teachers' arrival is not smooth
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces a new idea or event without sufficient context or explanation (e.g., the "Revels of Neptune" without prior explanation)
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes appears to digress without clear purpose (e.g., the detailed account of the bird feather robe seems somewhat disconnected from the main narrative)

Based on these observations, I would rate the text as follows:

For fluency: There are several grammatical errors and some punctuation issues, but the text is generally readable and the meaning is clear. The errors don't severely disrupt comprehension. I would give it a score of 3.5.

For coherence: The text has some logical jumps and abrupt transitions, but the overall narrative is generally coherent and follows a logical sequence. The structure is somewhat unusual but not confusing. I would give it a score of 3.5.
