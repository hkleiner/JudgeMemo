Alright, let me start by carefully reading the text to understand its content and identify any issues related to fluency and coherence.

The text is a preface and the first part of a book titled "Notes on Old Peterborough." It appears to be a historical account or memoir of the city, written in an older style of English. The preface discusses the value of the memoirs of Mr. Andrew Percival, the author of the notes, and provides some background about the city's development. The first chapter includes anecdotes about the author's arrival in Peterborough, the toll bars, breweries, and transportation methods like mail coaches.

Now, let's break down the evaluation:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "I thought our population is five or six thousand" - This is grammatically incorrect. It should be "I thought our population was five or six thousand."
2. [GRAMMAR] "You will recollected the enquiry" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "You will remember the enquiry."
3. [GRAMMAR] "the result being if you were an inhabitant" - The phrasing is awkward and grammatically incorrect. It should be "the result was that if you were an inhabitant."
4. [GRAMMAR] "am quite institutions of the place" - The verb "am" is used incorrectly. It should be "were."
5. [GRAMMAR] "The boy say he could not tell" - The verb tense is incorrect. It should be "The boy said he could not tell."
6. [GRAMMAR] "the size do you mean?" - The phrasing is awkward and grammatically incorrect. It should be "the size you mean?"
7. [GRAMMAR] "if you want me to tell you how big it was, I should think it was as big as a lump o’ chalk" - The phrasing is awkward and the use of "o’" is informal and inconsistent with the otherwise formal style.
8. [GRAMMAR] "Just conceived what a change there is" - The verb "conceived" is used incorrectly. It should be "Just imagine what a change there is."

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing the toll bars to anecdotes about breweries and then to transportation methods without clear connections.
2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear structure. The preface and the first chapter seem to be two separate sections with different purposes (one is an introduction, the other is the content), but the transition between them is abrupt.
3. [CLARITY] Some sentences are confusing due to poor phrasing and lack of context. For example, "You will recollected the enquiry, “Of whom do the Kings of the earth take tribute?" is confusing and lacks clarity.
4. [LOGIC] The text contains some anecdotes that are not clearly related to the main topic. For example, the story about the calculating boy and the witness seems out of place in a historical account of Peterborough.
5. [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses archaic or unclear phrasing that makes it difficult to understand the meaning. For example, "a one-horse carrier’s cart, which came twice a week" is clear, but "You must not ride inside" is unclear without context.

Now, let's assign scores:

**Fluency Score:**
The text contains multiple grammatical errors that affect readability. While the content is generally understandable, the errors are frequent enough to disrupt the flow. I would rate this as a 3 on the fluency scale.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has several coherence issues, including abrupt transitions, unclear structure, and some out-of-place anecdotes. The narrative is generally understandable but lacks a clear logical progression in parts. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.
