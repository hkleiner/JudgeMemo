Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria.

## Fluency Analysis

I'll look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "I have choose to mark" should be "I have chosen to mark"
- [GRAMMAR] "the latter half of this saeculum mirabile" has a missing apostrophe in "saeculum" (should be "saeculum")
- [GRAMMAR] "we may walk for a few miles by the side of a river, noted its shallows" - incorrect verb form (should be "noting" instead of "noted")
- [GRAMMAR] "There can was no question" should be "There can be no question"
- [GRAMMAR] "steam was use for crossing the seas" should be "steam was used for crossing the seas"
- [GRAMMAR] "The greatest sufferings cause by the revolution" should be "The greatest sufferings caused by the revolution"
- [GRAMMAR] "a new social order is being built up" should be "a new social order was being built up"
- [GRAMMAR] "which are now was dispersed" should be "which are now dispersed"
- [GRAMMAR] "They am not content" should be "They were not content"
- [GRAMMAR] "till Napoleon is out of the way" should be "till Napoleon was out of the way"
- [GRAMMAR] "The well-know controversial books" should be "The well-known controversial books"
- [GRAMMAR] "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions" - tense mismatch (should be "were restricted" or "are restricted" consistently)
- [GRAMMAR] "the vital statistics was those of Russia" should be "the vital statistics were those of Russia"
- [GRAMMAR] "the light taxes were raised with an ease" should be "the light taxes were raised with ease"

## Coherence Analysis

I'll look for issues related to logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and narrative structure.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing historical cycles to specific examples without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Some examples seem disconnected from the main thesis about the Victorian Age
- [LOGIC] The text mentions "the last three years" without context for when this was written
- [LOGIC] The reference to "my Romanes Lecture on 'The Idea of Progress'" is unclear without more context
- [LOGIC] The text shifts between discussing general historical patterns and specific Victorian England details without clear signaling
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction and conclusion that frame the discussion
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs begin with new topics without clear connections to previous content
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes introduces concepts (like the Industrial Revolution) without fully explaining them before moving on
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "saeculum mirabile" is not explained for readers who may not know Latin
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Dean Colet" is unclear without context
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "Chauvinism" and "Jingoism" is not explained for readers who may not be familiar with these terms
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the recent Great War" is unclear without specifying which war this refers to

Now I'll assign scores based on these issues:

For Fluency:
The text has 14 grammatical issues that need correction. However, these are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall readability of the text. The writing is generally clear and the meaning is usually understandable despite these errors. I would rate the fluency as a 4. The text is mostly fluent and well-structured with some minor grammatical issues.

For Coherence:
The text has several coherence issues that affect the logical flow and clarity. The transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and there are references to context that may not be clear to all readers. The structure could be improved with clearer signaling of topic shifts and better organization of ideas. However, the text does maintain a general coherence in discussing the Victorian Age and its historical context. I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.

So my final assessment is:
Fluency: 4
Coherence: 3.5
