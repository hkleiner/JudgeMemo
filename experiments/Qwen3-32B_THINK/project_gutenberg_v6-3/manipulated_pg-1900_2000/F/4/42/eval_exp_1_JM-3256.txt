Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "his books may was those without which a gentleman’s library is not complete" - This is grammatically incorrect. It should be "his books may be those" or "his books may have been those."

2. [GRAMMAR] "it mighted be excused in a bushman" - "mighted" is incorrect; it should be "might be."

3. [GRAMMAR] "it is also proved, which is much more important, that he have the smack of letters in him" - "have" is incorrect; it should be "has."

4. [SPELLING] "have been working over the books, and if anything new has been write by William Shakespeare" - "write" is incorrect; it should be "written."

5. [GRAMMAR] "the books thrown in—_All the Year Round_ from the beginning in half calf;" - This sentence fragment doesn't have a complete thought.

6. [GRAMMAR] "difficult to tore them away" - "tore" is incorrect; it should be "tear."

7. [GRAMMAR] "the subject of the book does not entered into the matter" - "entered" is incorrect; it should be "enter."

8. [SPELLING] "He woulded like to have Masson’s Life too in 6 vols. (with index)." - "woulded" is incorrect; it should be "would like."

9. [GRAMMAR] "He does not require Mr. Froude’s delightful apology to win the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ a place on his shelf" - This sentence is awkwardly constructed and hard to follow.

10. [SPELLING] "he must needs have his A’Kempis" - "A’Kempis" is misspelled; it should be "A Kempis" or "Thomas à Kempis."

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps between different examples and anecdotes without clear transitions, making it hard to follow the central argument.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat circular structure, revisiting similar themes without a clear progression.

3. [CLARITY] Some of the comparisons (like books to ships and cathedrals) are abstract and not clearly connected to the main point about bookmen.

4. [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory ideas without resolution (e.g., suggesting that light reading is acceptable but also distinguishing between books that "come and go" and those that "remain").

5. [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making the flow of the text choppy.

6. [CLARITY] The central thesis about what defines a "bookman" is not clearly stated at the beginning and is somewhat muddied by the various examples and anecdotes.

7. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new ideas without connecting them to previous content (e.g., the discussion of detective stories and Sherlock Holmes).

8. [CLARITY] The use of literary references and allusions may be obscure to some readers without context.

Now, let me determine the scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors and some spelling issues, but the overall meaning is still clear. The text is generally readable but contains multiple issues that interrupt the flow. This would likely be a 3 or 3.5. Given the number of errors, I'll score it as a 3.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a central theme but the structure is somewhat disorganized with abrupt transitions and unclear connections between ideas. The flow is choppy at times, and the central argument is not always clear. This would likely be a 3 or 3.5. Given the issues with structure and transitions, I'll score it as a 3.
