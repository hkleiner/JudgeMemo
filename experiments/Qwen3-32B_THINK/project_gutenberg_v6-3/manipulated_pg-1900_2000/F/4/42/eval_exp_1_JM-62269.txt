Alright, let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues according to the instructions.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **[GRAMMAR]** "I found a vacant plot of brick-strewn ground surrounded by high walls." - This sentence is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in phrasing.
2. **[GRAMMAR]** "And I knocked loudly and long." - The phrase "loudly and long" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better fluency.
3. **[GRAMMAR]** "into that shabby yard they had bring an unaccustomed glory" - This should be "into that shabby yard they had brought an unaccustomed glory."
4. **[GRAMMAR]** "He who stepped through the battered door in St. Andrew Street travelled fifteen hundred miles in a second." - The phrase "He who" is somewhat archaic and could be rephrased for modern fluency.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** "and in each plait was wove a cord" - This should be "and in each plait was woven a cord."
6. **[GRAMMAR]** "I was assured that carts had been ordered for seven o'clock to effect the removal of the band to two houses they had rented in Pitt Street." - This is a long sentence with complex phrasing that could be simplified for better fluency.
7. **[GRAMMAR]** "Wishing to see the flitting, I returned earlier than the time stated, found that they have departed at six" - This should be "found that they had departed at six."
8. **[GRAMMAR]** "on the Landing-stage" - The hyphen in "Landing-stage" is unnecessary and inconsistent with the rest of the text.
9. **[GRAMMAR]** "Kola may be said to have had, on the whole, the best of the argument." - This is grammatically correct but somewhat awkward in phrasing.
10. **[GRAMMAR]** "I intend that it should" - This should be "Kola intended that it should."
11. **[GRAMMAR]** "he coulded have exchanged anywhere for several hundred golden sovereigns" - This should be "he could have exchanged anywhere."
12. **[GRAMMAR]** "if you am to follow him across the Atlantic" - This should be "if you are to follow him across the Atlantic."
13. **[GRAMMAR]** "He has now remove his kingdom to Brazil" - This should be "He has now removed his kingdom to Brazil."
14. **[GRAMMAR]** "Kola’s kingdom shoulded be impossible" - This should be "Kola's kingdom should be impossible."
15. **[GRAMMAR]** "The luxurious chairs and sofas with which he furnishes his royal tent are vain ostentation; guests may use them, but Kola himself prefers to sit, as his ancestors have sat for countless centuries, cross-legged on the ground." - This is a long sentence with complex phrasing that could be simplified for better fluency.

### Coherence Issues:
1. **[LOGIC]** The text jumps abruptly from describing the Gypsies' arrival to their departure, without clear transitional sentences.
2. **[LOGIC]** The passage about the argument over the number of Gypsies at the boat is somewhat confusing, especially with the mention of the chief speaking Russian and the official speaking English.
3. **[LOGIC]** The transition from the description of the Gypsies' camp to the English Gypsies' reaction is somewhat abrupt.
4. **[LOGIC]** The explanation of Kola's identity and his various nationalities is a bit confusing and could be better structured.
5. **[LOGIC]** The description of Kola's kingdom and his policies is somewhat disjointed, with a sudden shift from describing his physical appearance to his business practices.
6. **[LOGIC]** The final paragraph about Kola's kingdom being "impossible" and his rejection of modern civilization is a bit confusing in its connection to the rest of the text.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

### Fluency Score:
The text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that affect its fluency. However, these issues are not so severe that they make the text difficult to understand. The text is generally readable and the meaning is clear despite the errors. I would rate the fluency as 3.5 out of 5.

### Coherence Score:
The text has some issues with logical flow and transitions between ideas, particularly in the way it moves from one scene to another and in the explanation of Kola's identity and his kingdom. However, the overall narrative is generally coherent and the reader can follow the story despite these issues. I would rate the coherence as 3.5 out of 5.
