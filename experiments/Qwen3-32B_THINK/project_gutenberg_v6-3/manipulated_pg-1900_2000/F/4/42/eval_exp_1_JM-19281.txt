Alright, I need to assess the given text according to the evaluation criteria for Fluency and Coherence. Let me first understand the instructions and the scales provided.

For Fluency, I need to look for issues in syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being highly fluent and 1 being largely unintelligible.

For Coherence, I need to evaluate how logically the text unfolds, with clear progression, smooth transitions, and consistent structure. The scale is similar, with 5 being highly coherent and 1 being largely incoherent.

Let me read through the text and identify potential issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. "it was with this in mind that we felt that our letter should was explicit in articulated it." - This sentence has incorrect grammar with "should was" and the word "articulated" is used incorrectly. It should be "should be explicit in articulating it." [GRAMMAR]

2. "Bahá'ís report that, in general, they am warmly welcomed." - The verb "am" is incorrect; it should be "are." [GRAMMAR]

3. "the accelerating breakdown in social order calls out desperately for the religious spirit to be free from the shackles that have so far prevent it from bringing to bear the healing influence of which it was capable." - The verb "prevent" is incorrect; it should be "prevented." [GRAMMAR]

4. "the individual was left free to maintain whatever relationship he believed connected his life to a world transcending material existence, but society as a whole proceed with growing confidence to sever dependence..." - The verb "proceed" is incorrect; it should be "proceeded." [GRAMMAR]

5. "the universal civilization towards the realization of which all the forces of history had been bore the human race..." - The phrase "had been bore" is incorrect; it should be "had borne." [GRAMMAR]

6. "having penetrate and captured all significant centres of power and information..." - The verb "penetrate" is incorrect; it should be "penetrated." [GRAMMAR]

7. "A world, which had assumed that with the collapse of the Berlin Wall an age of international peace had dawned..." - The phrase "had assumed that with the collapse..." has a missing article; it should be "had assumed that with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, an age..." [GRAMMAR]

8. "The most obvious cause of these re-evaluations has am the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise itself." - The phrase "has am" is incorrect; it should be "has been the bankruptcy..." [GRAMMAR]

9. "the building of just and prosperous societies could be ensured by one or another scheme of what was described as modernization." - The phrase "one or another" is awkward; it should be "one or another scheme" or "one or another schemes." [LEXICON]

10. "The goal held up as justification of such abuses was the creation of a new kind of society that woulded ensure not only freedom from want but fulfilment for the human spirit." - The verb "woulded" is incorrect; it should be "would ensure." [GRAMMAR]

11. "The closing decades of the twentieth century, however, sagged under a mounting burden of evidence to the contrary: the breakdown of family life, soaring crime, dysfunctional educational systems..." - The phrase "sagged under" is awkward and could be replaced with "saw" or "were marked by." [LEXICON]

12. "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development has left no doubt." - The sentence is incomplete; it seems to end abruptly without a conclusion. [STRUCTURE]

**Coherence Issues:**

1. The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing the Bahá'í letter to the response to it, then to historical context, and then to current events. [TRANSITION]

2. There are some abrupt shifts in focus, such as from the response to the letter to the discussion of the twentieth century's materialistic interpretation of reality. [TRANSITION]

3. The text discusses the reawakened interest in religion and spiritual search, but the connection between these ideas and the Bahá'í perspective is not always clear. [LOGIC]

4. The final chapter on the reawakened interest in religion is somewhat disjointed, with multiple subtopics (materialist enterprise, social experimentation, family breakdown, etc.) that are not clearly connected. [STRUCTURE]

5. Some concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation, such as the reference to "Majnún" and "Laylí," which may be unfamiliar to many readers. [CLARITY]

6. The text has a tendency to become overly abstract at times, making it difficult to follow the exact argument or point being made. [CLARITY]

7. The flow between chapters is not always smooth, with each chapter starting a new topic without clear links to the previous one. [STRUCTURE]

8. Some sections are repetitive, such as the repeated emphasis on the importance of religion and the consequences of materialism. [REPETITION]

Now, I need to assign scores based on these issues.

For **Fluency**, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but it's generally readable. The most serious issues are the grammatical errors, but they are not so frequent as to make the text difficult to understand. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but contains multiple grammatical issues that interrupt the flow.

For **Coherence**, the text has some logical progression and organization, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. The connections between some ideas are not always clear, and the text could benefit from smoother transitions. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.
