Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency. I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text seems to have some issues. For example, there are a few instances where the verb tenses might be inconsistent. Like in "have shown respect for Madame Yen’s judgment," the verb should probably be "had shown" to maintain past tense. Also, there's "gain by her nearness to her grandmother" which should be "gained by." Another one is "that made possible the spirit of freedom that lit the eyes of the American girl" – maybe "that made possible the spirit of freedom that lit the eyes of the American girl" is correct, but it feels a bit awkward. There are also some missing articles or prepositions, like "the Street of Precious Pearls that her inheritance is spent, lest by bringing money, as such, into her husband’s household she reflect upon the ability of her new family to support her." The phrase "reflect upon" might be incorrect here; perhaps it should be "reflect on" or "reflect against." Also, some sentences are a bit run-on or could be split for clarity.

Next, coherence. The story is about Kuei Ping's experience buying dowry jewels and her internal conflict about her future. The narrative flows through the procession, the jewel selection, and her memories of the mission school. However, the transition into the memory at the mission school is a bit abrupt. The sentence "With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically, Kuei Ping was back in memory..." is a bit jarring. The connection between the memory and the present moment could be smoother. Also, the ending jumps from the memory back to the present without a clear transition, which might confuse the reader. There's also a part where the story shifts from the dowry scene to her internal conflict about the mission school and her family's expectations, but the link between these events isn't very clear. Some ideas are introduced but not fully explained, like the engagement bracelets and the silver medal, which might leave the reader wondering about their significance.

For fluency, the main issues are grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. For coherence, the main problems are abrupt transitions and unclear connections between ideas. 

Now, scoring. For fluency, there are several errors but they don't make the text hard to understand. So maybe a 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues. For coherence, the transitions are a bit rough but the overall story is understandable. So maybe a 3.5 or 3. The abrupt shifts and unclear links affect the flow but don't make it incoherent.
