Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for **Fluency**:

Looking at the text, I notice a few grammatical and syntactic issues. For example, in the first paragraph, "The year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the Fourteenth being still King of France..." – the structure here is a bit awkward. The phrase "Louis the Fourteenth being still King of France" is a non-restrictive clause that's not properly introduced with a comma, which might confuse readers.

There's also some inconsistent punctuation. For instance, "there stood in the vestry of the parish church of Saint Jean-en-Grève a little group of the small burgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to the king's palace, one François Prévost, signed solemnly as witness..." – the use of "whilst" instead of "while" is more British English, but that's not necessarily an error. However, the structure here is a bit long and could be more concise.

Another example is "The worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bow in the best Court manner to Mademoiselle Boullenois..." – the verb "bow" should be "bowed" to match the past tense. Also, "he bow" is a subject-verb agreement error.

There are also some awkward phrasings, like "The child's first year see the English troopers ride down the French at Blenheim..." – "see" should be "saw" to maintain past tense consistency. Additionally, "to came into Boucher's life in after years" – "came" should be "come" after "to".

I also notice some missing commas and hyphens for clarity. For example, in "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste..." – the comma placement could be adjusted for better flow.

Overall, there are several grammatical errors, some awkward sentence structures, and minor punctuation issues that affect fluency. However, the text is still generally readable, so the fluency score is likely around 3.5.

Now for **Coherence**:

The text is a narrative about François Boucher's early life and career. The structure follows a chronological order, which is good for coherence. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For example, after discussing Boucher's early life, the text jumps to his time in Italy without a smooth transition. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "the child's first year see the English troopers ride down the French at Blenheim..." – the connection between Boucher's early life and the historical events is a bit disjointed. The text mentions several battles and political events, but the flow between these and Boucher's personal story isn't always smooth.

Another issue is the lack of clear transitions between different phases of Boucher's life. For example, the shift from his education to his work with "Père Cars" is abrupt. Additionally, the text sometimes introduces new ideas without sufficient context, making it hard to follow the narrative.

There's also a minor issue with the timeline. The text mentions events in Boucher's life while also discussing broader historical events, which could be confusing if not clearly connected. The coherence is affected by these abrupt shifts and the lack of smooth transitions between different topics.

Despite these issues, the overall structure is logical, and the main narrative is clear. However, the problems with transitions and unclear connections between ideas lower the coherence score. A score of 3.5 seems appropriate here as well.

Putting it all together, the fluency and coherence scores would be around 3.5 each. The text has noticeable issues in both areas, but it's still readable and the main points are generally clear.
