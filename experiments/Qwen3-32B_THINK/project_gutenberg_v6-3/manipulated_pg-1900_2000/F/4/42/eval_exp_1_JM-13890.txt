Alright, let me assess the text according to the criteria of fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Issues
I'll look for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. **[GRAMMAR] - "is sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., "To thee, Thomas Becket..."** - There's a comma splice here, with a sentence fragment following a period.
2. **[GRAMMAR] - "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons is sent forth..."** - The verb "is" should be "was" for proper tense consistency with "It was on April 24, 1538."
3. **[GRAMMAR] - "Now, I do not disguised the fact..."** - "disguised" should be "disguise" to match the infinitive "do not."
4. **[GRAMMAR] - "they was less devout..."** - "was" should be "were" to match the plural subject "they."
5. **[GRAMMAR] - "for the writer's endeavour to indicate..."** - "endeavour" should be "endeavor" for American English (though both spellings are correct, the inconsistency is a minor issue).
6. **[GRAMMAR] - "It would be a mistake to imagine that it solely was due..."** - This is awkward phrasing; "solely was" should be "was solely" for better syntax.
7. **[GRAMMAR] - "the city was ancient before the days of Thomas of Canterbury..."** - This is awkward phrasing; it would be clearer as "the city was ancient before Thomas of Canterbury's time."
8. **[GRAMMAR] - "the earliest people who have left evidence..."** - "have" should be "had" for proper past tense.
9. **[GRAMMAR] - "He described them as being little different..."** - The phrasing is awkward and could be simplified.
10. **[GRAMMAR] - "It was probably not until Ethelbert had begun to reigned..."** - "reigned" should be "reign" to match the infinitive "to."

There are several grammatical issues in the text, but they are not so severe that they prevent understanding.

### Coherence Issues
I'll look for problems with logical sequencing, transitions, clarity, and overall structure.

1. **[LOGIC] - The text jumps from the 16th century to Roman times without clear transition.** - There's an abrupt shift from discussing modern pilgrims to the historical origins of Canterbury.
2. **[STRUCTURE] - The text mixes modern and historical perspectives without clear organization.** - The narrative moves between different time periods without clear indication or transition.
3. **[LOGIC] - The argument about modern pilgrims being less devout is not clearly connected to the historical narrative.** - The modern critique seems disconnected from the detailed historical account.
4. **[TRANSITION] - The text moves from discussing the Pilgrims' Way to Roman history without a clear transition.** - The connection between these topics is not made explicit.
5. **[CLARITY] - Some historical details are presented without sufficient context or explanation.** - For example, references to specific historical figures or events may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with English history.

The text has some coherence issues, particularly in its organization and transitions between different time periods and topics, but it generally maintains a logical progression within each section.

### Final Scores

**Fluency Score:** 4.5 - The text is mostly fluent with only a few grammatical issues that don't significantly disrupt reading. The problems I identified are relatively minor and don't prevent understanding.

**Coherence Score:** 4 - The text is generally coherent but has some issues with transitions between different time periods and mixing of modern and historical perspectives. The organization could be improved, but the content is still logically presented within each section.
