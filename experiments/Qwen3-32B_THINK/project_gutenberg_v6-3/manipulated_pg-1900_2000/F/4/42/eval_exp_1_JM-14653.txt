Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user wants me to identify issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious errors.

Looking at the first paragraph, I notice "The Feast of St. Friend" with a hyphen at the beginning. That might be a formatting issue rather than a fluency problem. Then in the first chapter, "In order to be convinced of this it is only necessary..." – there's a missing comma after "this" which is a syntax issue. 

Next, "The tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping..." The phrase "the cord snapping" is a bit unclear. Maybe "the cord snapping before it ought to snap" is redundant. Not a major issue, but a minor one in phrasing.

In the second paragraph, "we were glad to be kept awake so." The "so" here might be better as "so much" for clarity. Also, "We sang with gusto 'Christians awake, salute the happy morn.'" The title of the song is in italics or quotes? The user's text uses quotes, but maybe italics would be more appropriate. That's more of a style choice, not a fluency problem.

Moving on, "And we ate, and we drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition..." The repetition of "ate" is stylistic but acceptable. However, "dranked" is a misspelling of "drank." That's a clear spelling error affecting fluency. 

In the next section, "by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a carnival..." The use of "fit only for a carnival" is a bit awkward. Maybe "suitable only for a carnival" would be better. But it's a minor phrasing issue.

Then, "we did not cared; we suffered gladly..." The verb "cared" should be "care" to match "did not." That's a grammar error. 

In the second chapter, "If the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon..." The subjunctive "were" is correct here. No issue. 

"Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented any institution..." The sentence structure is okay, but "any institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of children." The phrase "specially for the benefit of children" might be better as "specifically for the benefit of children." A minor word choice issue.

"Children have merely accept it and appropriated it." "Accept" should be "accepted." Another grammar error. 

"They are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary!" The semicolon here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit abrupt. Maybe a period would be better. However, the use of "terric" is a typo for "terrible" or "terrific." Wait, the text says "terric" – that's a spelling error. 

"they do the best they could with it." "Could" should be "can." Grammar error again. 

In the section about the old Christmas hymns, "They were written by devotees. And this age could not have produced them." The transition is smooth, no issue. 

In the part about the scientists, "I mean the great philosophers and men of science--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century." The em dashes are correctly used. 

"Having been compelled to abandon its belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles and ideals with alleged facts..." The sentence is a bit complex but grammatically correct. 

"They forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual and moral, remain absolutely intact." The phrasing is okay. 

Overall, there are several spelling and grammar errors, like "dranked" instead of "drank," "cared" instead of "care," "terric" instead of "terrible" or "terrific," and "could" instead of "can." There are also a few instances of missing commas and awkward phrasing. These issues affect fluency but are not so severe that the text becomes unreadable. The text is mostly fluent with some minor errors.

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a narrative about the changing perception of Christmas over time. The structure is divided into two chapters: "The Fact" and "The Reason." The flow of ideas seems logical. The author contrasts past and present Christmas celebrations, then delves into the reasons for the change. 

In the first chapter, the author describes the past Christmas as filled with excitement and tradition, then contrasts it with the present, where Christmas feels more like a burden. The transition between these ideas is smooth. 

In the second chapter, the author argues that the decline is due to the influence of 19th-century scientists and philosophers. The connection between the loss of faith and the change in Christmas is made, but some parts might be a bit dense. For example, the discussion about the Christmas hymns and their authors is clear, but the jump to the scientists' impact is a bit abrupt. 

There's a mention of children being "terric Tories," which is a typo but doesn't affect coherence much. The argument is presented in a logical sequence, but some readers might find the shift from discussing children to the role of scientists a bit sudden. However, the author does connect these ideas by stating that the loss of faith in facts led to the loss of Christmas spirit. 

The conclusion ties back to the initial thesis, reinforcing the idea that the Christmas spirit remains important despite the changes. The overall structure is coherent, but there are a few points where the flow could be smoother. For example, the transition from discussing the children's role to the scientists' impact could use a clearer connection. Also, the mention of the "bottom being knocked out of Christmas" is a metaphor that might need more explanation for clarity. 

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a clear progression of ideas. The main issues are minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding. The structure is logical, and the arguments are presented in a way that connects the past and present, then the reasons behind the change. However, there are a few instances where the flow between sections could be improved for better coherence.
