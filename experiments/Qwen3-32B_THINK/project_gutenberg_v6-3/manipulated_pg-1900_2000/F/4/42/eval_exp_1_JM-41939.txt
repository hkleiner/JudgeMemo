Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the fluency and coherence of the given text.

Starting with fluency. The text is a narrative about Rosa Bonheur's early life. I'll scan for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice issues. 

First, I notice some verb tense errors. For example, "he make the acquaintance" should be "he made." Similarly, "He continue to teach" is incorrect; it should be "he continued." These are clear [GRAMMAR] issues. 

Next, there are some spelling mistakes. "am taken in her father's studio" – "am" should be "were" since it's past tense. "avoided the fatal contagion" – "avoided" is correct, but maybe the issue is elsewhere. Wait, "have fitted up a studio" – "have" should be "had." Another [GRAMMAR] problem. 

Looking at syntax and phrasing, "It is not surprising in such an artistic environment, that the child's taste..." has a comma splice. Maybe a missing comma or period. Also, "another great source of amusement is to cut objects..." uses present tense where past is needed. [SYNTAX] issues. 

There's also word choice. For example, "the Silvelas urged Raymond Bonheur to come and join them in Paris where, they said, he would find..." The "where" here is a bit awkward. Maybe "where they said he would find..." [LEXICON]. 

Now, coherence. The text is a chronological narrative. I need to check for logical flow, transitions, and structure. 

The story moves through Rosa's childhood, her family's moves, her education, and early successes. The transitions between events are generally smooth, but there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the paragraph about the Silvela family leaving Bordeaux and the Bonheurs moving to Paris is followed by Rosa starting school. The connection between these events isn't clearly explained. [LOGIC]. 

Also, the mention of Mlle. Micas as a friend comes after the family moves to a gloomy mansion. The link between the mansion's atmosphere and meeting Micas isn't clear. [STRUCTURE]. 

There's a jump from the 1830 revolution to the cholera outbreak in 1832. The text doesn't explain how these events affect the family's situation, leading to a lack of clarity. [CLARITY]. 

Another issue is the repetition of the family moving locations. The text mentions multiple relocations without a clear reason, which might confuse the reader. [STRUCTURE]. 

Overall, the fluency has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the text is mostly readable. Coherence is generally good, but some transitions and explanations are missing, causing minor confusion. 

For the final scores, considering fluency: the text has multiple grammar issues and some syntax problems, but it's still understandable. A score of 3.5 might be appropriate. Coherence has some logical jumps but the overall narrative holds together, so a 4 might be fair. Wait, but the coherence issues are more about missing explanations. Maybe a 3.5? Hmm. Let me check the scales again. 

Fluency Scale: 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity." The text has several issues but is still readable. 3.5 could be a half-point between 3 and 4. 

Coherence Scale: 4 is "Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts." The text is mostly coherent but has some weak transitions. So 4 might be better. Wait, but the user mentioned to use half-points if needed. Let me see. The coherence issues are present but not too severe. Maybe a 4. 

So final scores: Fluency 3.5 and Coherence 4.
