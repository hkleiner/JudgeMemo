Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues

I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, word choice issues, and punctuation problems:

1) [GRAMMAR] "it may seemed perhaps to others somewhat unessential" - incorrect verb form (should be "may seem")
2) [GRAMMAR] "we should not be what we are" - awkward phrasing with missing conjunction
3) [GRAMMAR] "the masses was ever to be reached" - subject-verb agreement issue (should be "were")
4) [GRAMMAR] "in the camp of the Suffragettes it is also understood that the revolution which the capitalist method of production had caused in the position of women, has been of great importance in caused many to agitate for their rights" - run-on sentence with grammatical issues
5) [GRAMMAR] "I would referred, for example, to the declaration" - incorrect verb form (should be "refer")
6) [GRAMMAR] "the women in the country districts have votes for the local bodies" - awkward phrasing
7) [GRAMMAR] "women who was indirectly electors" - subject-verb agreement issue (should be "were")
8) [GRAMMAR] "There is no need for the middle-class to was ashamed" - incorrect verb form (should be "be")
9) [GRAMMAR] "this question of the rights of women was demand by the middle-class" - incorrect verb form (should be "demanded")
10) [GRAMMAR] "many advantages have am gained" - incorrect word order (should be "have been gained")

# Coherence Issues

I'll look for logical flow problems, abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and overall structure issues:

1) [LOGIC] The text jumps between different historical periods and locations without clear transitions
2) [LOGIC] The argument sometimes becomes circular or repetitive without clear progression
3) [LOGIC] The connection between capitalism and women's suffrage is presented but not clearly explained or developed
4) [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion structure
5) [STRUCTURE] The argument sometimes shifts from one point to another without clear signposting
6) [LOGIC] The text makes sweeping generalizations about different groups without sufficient evidence
7) [LOGIC] The historical examples are presented without clear relevance to the main argument
8) [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes assumptions about the reader's knowledge without explanation
9) [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and dense without paragraph breaks to help organize ideas
10) [LOGIC] The conclusion is not clearly stated or developed from the premises

Now I'll determine the scores based on the evaluation criteria:

# Fluency Score
The text contains multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow. These issues are numerous enough to be distracting but not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand overall. Based on the scale, this would be a 3 - "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways."

# Coherence Score
The text has significant issues with logical flow and structure. The argument sometimes jumps between points without clear connections, and the overall structure is not well-organized. While some ideas are coherent, the text as a whole lacks a clear progression and unified argument. Based on the scale, this would be a 3 - "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience."

Let me double-check these assessments:

For fluency: The text is generally understandable but contains enough grammatical errors and awkward phrasing to be distracting. It's not completely unintelligible or fragmented, so a score of 3 is appropriate.

For coherence: The text has a clear main topic (women's suffrage from a socialist perspective) but the argument is not well-structured. There are abrupt shifts between historical examples, and the logical connections are sometimes unclear. The text could be more coherent with better organization and clearer transitions. A score of 3 is appropriate as it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues with flow and structure.
