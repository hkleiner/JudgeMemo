Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] "Russia at present lies in seas of blood and tears" - "lies in seas" is awkward phrasing.
2. [GRAMMAR] "because she was exhausted by three years of active participation in the War, during which her casualties reached 12,000,000" - This is a very long sentence with multiple clauses that is difficult to follow.
3. [GRAMMAR] "Russia's present pitiful condition is the result of her self-sacrificing services to humanity" - "self-sacrificing services" is awkward phrasing.
4. [GRAMMAR] "not less than 3,000,000 were in dead" - This is incorrect; should be "were dead" or "had died".
5. [GRAMMAR] "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army, and three-four times all the forces mustered by the United States" - Missing hyphen in "three-four" (should be "three-fourths").
6. [GRAMMAR] "the number of Russia's casualties is larger than the total population of any of the following European countries" - Awkward phrasing.
7. [GRAMMAR] "If Russia had not sacrificed 3,000,000 of her best youth, now sleeping on the battle-fields of Europe, a Prussian bayonet would now be ruled the world" - "would now be ruled the world" is grammatically incorrect.
8. [GRAMMAR] "the role played by Russia and the services the Russian Armies rendered in the struggle against Prussian Imperialism could was seen further" - "could was" is grammatically incorrect.
9. [GRAMMAR] "which had invaded Roumania, stopped the further advance of the Germans, and undertook the defense of a considerable stretch of the Roumanian front" - Awkward sentence structure.
10. [GRAMMAR] "losses sustain by any of the other Allies" - Missing "sustained" or "sustained by".
11. [GRAMMAR] "the British Army was still in the process of formation" - Awkward phrasing.
12. [GRAMMAR] "This weakening of the powers of the enemy by Russia was already bound at various stages of the War to facilitate correspondingly the various operations of the Allies" - Awkward and complex sentence.
13. [GRAMMAR] "It is a fact that it took from six weeks to two months to mobilize the armed forces of Russia" - Awkward phrasing with "from six weeks to two months".
14. [GRAMMAR] "It is true that for the complete realization of this scheme it was necessary that the Austrian Army, as well involve France" - Missing "as well as" and awkward phrasing.
15. [GRAMMAR] "This should had been anticipated" - Incorrect verb form; should be "should have been".
16. [GRAMMAR] "It may be said that Russia could had occupied Galicia and East Prussia had the Austrian Army left for France" - Incorrect verb forms; should be "could have occupied" and "had left".
17. [GRAMMAR] "The loss of the Marne would have been equivalent to the loss of the War by France" - Awkward phrasing; should be "the loss of the War for France".
18. [GRAMMAR] "It is the recognition of these facts that should prompted every impartial historian" - Incorrect verb form; should be "should prompt".
19. [GRAMMAR] "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia towards the end of the War are obscuring the true historic role of Russia" - Awkward phrasing.
20. [GRAMMAR] "It is just as simple to understand that during that period, when the enemy was most powerful and undemoralized" - Missing hyphen in "undemoralized" (should be "undemoralized").

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The text jumps from the introduction of the author to Russia's role in the war without clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] The text presents statistics and data without clear organization or context, making it difficult to follow the overall argument.
3. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure or organization that would help readers follow the author's argument about Russia's role in the war.
4. [LOGIC] The text presents multiple claims about Russia's role without clearly establishing the relationship between these claims.
5. [LOGIC] The text shifts between discussing Russia's sacrifices, its military contributions, and the impact of the Russian Revolution without clear transitions.
6. [STRUCTURE] The text has a repetitive structure, with similar points being made in different sections without clear progression.
7. [LOGIC] The text presents a strong argument for Russia's importance in the war but then questions whether Germany could have won, creating some logical tension that isn't fully resolved.
8. [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed flow between the introduction and the second chapter, which begins with a new set of arguments about Russia's role.
9. [LOGIC] The text makes claims about the author's expertise and the importance of the subject without providing a clear roadmap for the reader.
10. [LOGIC] The text ends with a discussion of Ludendorf's memoirs, which seems somewhat disconnected from the main argument about Russia's role in the war.
11. [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex structure with multiple nested arguments that are not always clearly presented.
12. [LOGIC] The text presents some contradictory ideas, such as Russia's importance in the war versus the impact of the Russian Revolution, without resolving these contradictions.
13. [LOGIC] The text makes strong claims about the author's perspective but doesn't always clearly distinguish these from historical facts.
14. [LOGIC] The text shifts between discussing military strategy, casualty statistics, and political outcomes without clear transitions.
15. [LOGIC] The text presents a somewhat circular argument about Russia's role, where the author seems to assume what they are trying to prove.

Now, let me assign scores based on these issues:

**Fluency Score:**
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and complex sentences that make it difficult to read. However, the main ideas are generally clear, and the text is still mostly understandable. The issues are not so severe that they make the text incomprehensible, but they do significantly affect readability. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a somewhat disjointed structure, with logical jumps between ideas, unclear organization of arguments, and some contradictory statements. The author presents multiple claims about Russia's role in the war without clearly establishing the relationship between these claims or providing a clear roadmap for the reader. The text is somewhat difficult to follow, especially for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.
