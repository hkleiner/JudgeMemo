Alright, let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:
Looking at the text, I notice several grammatical and phrasing issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "One woulded not say" - The correct form should be "One would not say"
2. [GRAMMAR] "we are rather inclined to go beyond our brief in dealing with a representative man" - This phrase is awkwardly constructed and could be clearer
3. [GRAMMAR] "Reynolds did not happened to be" - The correct form should be "Reynolds did not happen to be"
4. [GRAMMAR] "He might be say to have owed" - The correct form should be "He might be said to have owed"
5. [GRAMMAR] "he could not have given the world any one of the pictures that are reproduced here" - This phrase is awkward and could be clearer
6. [GRAMMAR] "For colour he had go to Titian" - The correct form should be "For colour he had to go to Titian"
7. [GRAMMAR] "it was the sojourn in that real home of art that brought Reynolds back to England a portrait painter of the first class" - This is a very long and complex sentence that could be clearer
8. [GRAMMAR] "he had met with two unfortunate accidents. In Minorca he have fallen" - The tense is inconsistent (he have vs. he had)
9. [GRAMMAR] "he live for the remainder of his life" - The correct form should be "he lived for the remainder of his life"
10. [GRAMMAR] "he was brought into contact--witness the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought when he establish himself" - The correct form should be "when he established himself"
11. [GRAMMAR] "Of course the faults of a man and the merits of his work are distinct and stand apart from one another" - This sentence is awkward and could be clearer
12. [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format" - This is a strange phrase at the end of the text that doesn't fit the content
13. [GRAMMAR] "There is hardly a "Lion Comique," or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary" - The quotation marks are improperly used here
14. [GRAMMAR] "the man in the street might stare open-mouthed and talk about her brother" - This phrase is awkward
15. [GRAMMAR] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical" - The punctuation is awkward here

These issues indicate that the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the overall flow is still mostly understandable.

## Coherence Issues:
Looking at the overall structure and flow of the text:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text is structured as a biography of Reynolds, but the flow is somewhat choppy and jumps between different aspects of his life and work
2. [LOGIC] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear, making it difficult to follow the logical progression
3. [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or contain unnecessary information that disrupts the flow
4. [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces new ideas or concepts without sufficient explanation or context
5. [STRUCTURE] The conclusion feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the text
6. [LOGIC] Some comparisons or analogies are not fully explained, leaving the reader to infer meaning
7. [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses overly complex vocabulary or phrasing that could be simplified
8. [LOGIC] The final paragraph about "Lion Comique" and "lady of the music halls" feels somewhat out of place and doesn't clearly connect to the overall biography
9. [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure, with some paragraphs focusing on different aspects of Reynolds' life without clear transitions
10. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces historical context that isn't directly relevant to Reynolds' biography

Overall, the text is coherent in that it's a biography of Reynolds and the ideas generally flow in a logical sequence, but there are some issues with transitions and organization that could be improved.

## Fluency Score:
Given the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the overall flow is still mostly understandable, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.

## Coherence Score:
The text is a coherent biography of Reynolds, with a clear subject and logical progression through his life and work. However, there are some issues with transitions and organization that make the flow less smooth than it could be. I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.
