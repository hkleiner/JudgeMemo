Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The text is a chapter from a novel, so I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "I’lled give everything up" should be "I'll give everything up". Also, "it woulded be so difficult" is incorrect; it should be "it would be so difficult". There are a few instances where past tense is incorrectly used instead of past participle, like "he woulded say something" which should be "he would say something". 

Next, there are issues with syntax. Some sentences are run-on or awkwardly structured. For example, "She had left behind her such a general passion of regret that in kissing each other they felt themselves a little to be kissing her." This sentence is a bit convoluted and could be clearer. 

Word choice and phrasing also have some problems. For instance, "She flourished about her face, in a vaguely protecting sheltering way, an enormous fan of red feathers." The verb "flourished" here is used in a way that might be confusing; perhaps "waved" or "held" would be more appropriate. 

Punctuation is generally okay, but there are places where commas are missing or misplaced, making sentences a bit hard to parse. For example, "She was a person of courage, and he was a kind, an intensely good-natured man; nevertheless she went in some fear of him." The semicolon here might be better as a period, or the sentence structure could be adjusted for clarity.

Looking at coherence, the narrative follows a logical progression, but there are some abrupt shifts in perspective. The story moves from Adela's observations to her internal thoughts and then to her interactions with her father and brother. These shifts are somewhat jarring and might confuse the reader. 

There are also some unclear transitions between scenes. For example, the transition from the dinner party to Adela wandering into another room is abrupt. The reader might not immediately grasp why she moves there. 

Additionally, some character motivations are not fully explained. For instance, why Mrs. Churchley is detaining the Colonel and Adela isn't entirely clear, which could make the interactions between the characters seem a bit disjointed. 

The ending of the chapter leaves some questions unanswered, which might affect the overall coherence. The reader is left wondering about the implications of the Colonel's potential marriage and the family's reaction, but the narrative doesn't provide enough resolution or setup for the next chapter.

Considering all these points, the fluency issues are moderate but noticeable, affecting readability. The coherence issues are more about the structure and transitions rather than outright incoherence, but they do impact the flow of the narrative. I would rate fluency a 3.5 and coherence a 3.5 as well, since the text is generally readable and coherent but has enough issues to lower the score.
