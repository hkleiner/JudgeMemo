Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to go through the text and check for fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite old-fashioned, with complex sentence structures. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues.

Looking at the first paragraph: "high on the mountain's side hangs the steep little town of Grasse, embowered midst grey-green olive-trees." "Midst" is an old word, maybe not commonly used today, but it's correct. "Hangs" is used metaphorically, which is okay. The sentence is a bit long but not grammatically incorrect.

Next sentence: "In as sombre a narrow street as there is in all her dark alleys..." The use of "her" to refer to the town is clear. "Somber" vs. "sombre" – the text uses "sombre," which is the British spelling. Not an error. 

Then: "on the fifth day of April in the much bewigged and powdered year of 1732..." The phrase "much bewigged and powdered" is a bit archaic but still understandable. The structure is a bit awkward but not incorrect.

Looking for spelling errors: "embowered" – correct. "sombre" – correct. "glovemaker" – correct. "mercant" – the text says "mercant" in one place, but I think it should be "merchant" or "glovemaker." Wait, in the text: "to a glovemaker of the town, worthy mercer Fragonard..." "Mercer" is correct. "Worthy mercer" is a bit old-fashioned but okay. 

Next part: "the priest in the gloomy church christened Jean Honoré Fragonard." Correct. 

Then: "he vowed his child to commerce and a thrifty life..." Correct. 

Looking at the sentence structure: "nay, scarce gave serious thought to her gadding fashions or her feverish vogues..." The use of "nay" and "scarce" is archaic but still correct. 

In the next paragraph: "the wizardry of the flower-garden of France never left him, casting its spell over all his thinking, and calling to him to utter it to the world." The sentence is a bit long and uses a lot of metaphors, but it's grammatically correct. 

Now, checking for any grammatical errors. The text uses a lot of commas in complex sentences. For example: "As a fact, the dark-eyed, long-nosed folk that trudged these steep and narrow thoroughfares were a sluggish people; and sunlit Grasse snored away its day in drowsy fashion." The semicolon is used correctly here. 

Another part: "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse..." The phrase "on but sluggish feet" is a bit awkward but not incorrect. 

Looking for spelling errors: "attenuated" is correct. "wriggled" is correct. "promenades" is correct. 

Next: "the dark-eyed, long-nosed folk that trudged these steep and narrow thoroughfares were a sluggish people; and sunlit Grasse snored away its day in drowsy fashion." The use of "folk" is okay. 

Moving on to coherence. The text is a historical narrative about Fragonard's life and the context of his time. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, if there are abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.

The first chapter talks about Fragonard's birth and the environment of Grasse. Then it shifts to the political and cultural context of France at the time, mentioning Boucher, the Pompadour, and other historical events. The transition between the personal narrative and the broader historical context is a bit abrupt. For example, after describing the town, it jumps to the political events in France. 

In the second chapter, the narrative moves to Fragonard's training in Paris. The transition from his childhood in Grasse to moving to Paris is mentioned, but the connection between his personal development and the broader historical events could be clearer. 

There are some instances where the text mentions historical figures and events without clear links to Fragonard's story. For example, the discussion about the Pompadour's influence and the political events in France is detailed, but it's not always clear how this directly affects Fragonard's life or art. 

The structure of the text is chronological, which helps with coherence, but the shifts between personal and historical narratives can be jarring. The text does provide some connections, like mentioning how Boucher's art influenced Fragonard, but at times the historical context feels like a separate narrative thread.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are a few points where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. The historical context is relevant but sometimes presented in a way that doesn't clearly tie back to Fragonard's personal journey.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with excessive subordination.  
- [LEXICON] Obscure/archaic vocabulary (e.g., "embowered," "nay," "wriggled").  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage ("he was to be beholden," "he urge").  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies ("mercant" vs. "mercant").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and commas in long sentences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between Fragonard’s personal narrative and historical/political context.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connections between broader historical events and Fragonard’s artistic development.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs (e.g., sudden shift from Grasse to Paris training).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "she" in "she had been for three years the king's acknowledged mistress").  
- [LOGIC] Redundant repetition of historical details with minimal relevance to Fragonard’s story.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
