Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

**Fluency Issues:**
First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues. 

- The phrase "the effort was well spend" has a spelling error; it should be "spent."
- "This paper would had been nought" is incorrect. The correct past perfect form is "would have been."
- "Most archaeologists agreed" should be "agree" if the context is present tense.
- "we shall attempt to presented the evidence" has a tense inconsistency; it should be "present."
- "Our Basketmakers, which are not to be confused..." uses "which" incorrectly; it should be "who" since it refers to people.
- "The Mescalero band settled in an area which included the Guadalupe Mountains..." uses "which" again when "where" would be more appropriate.
- "if only to break the humdrum of everyday existence" has an awkward phrasing.
- "the people am afraid of the bats" has a subject-verb agreement error; it should be "are."
- "The bats and night owls raided together, but the people overcome their fear..." should be "overcame" for past tense.
- "Beneath the entrance have been found skeletons" is passive voice that's awkward; active voice would be better.
- "It is safe to assume that he dressed in skins, if he dressed at all" has a repetitive structure.
- "There is some similarity in culture traits to the Big Bend Basketmakers..." uses "culture traits" which is a bit awkward; "cultural traits" is more standard.
- "However, to avoided later confusion" has an incorrect form; it should be "avoid."
- "The Carlsbad Basketmakers were an unusual group only 'here and there adopting a few cultural traits...'" is a run-on sentence that could be split for clarity.

**Coherence Issues:**
Now, looking at how the text flows logically and the structure of the narrative.

- The text jumps from the acknowledgements section directly into the main content without a clear transition.
- The section on Early Man is very brief and lacks sufficient context compared to the detailed sections on the Basketmakers and Apaches.
- The connection between the Basketmakers and the later Apache and Comanche groups is not clearly explained, making the timeline confusing.
- The text mentions the Spanish introduction of horses but doesn't clearly link this to the Apache movements and changes in the Basketmakers' lifestyle.
- The transition between the Basketmakers and the Pueblo groups is abrupt, with little explanation of the cultural shifts.
- The final paragraph about the Carlsbad Basketmakers' possible absorption into Pueblo groups is introduced suddenly without prior buildup.
- The use of phrases like "It is very unlikely that they ventured beyond..." and "Thus, we cannot say..." creates uncertainty that isn't resolved, leaving the reader with unresolved questions.

**Final Scores:**
For fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but it's generally readable. I'll rate it a 3.5.
For coherence, the structure is somewhat disjointed with abrupt transitions and unclear connections between sections. I'll rate it a 3.
