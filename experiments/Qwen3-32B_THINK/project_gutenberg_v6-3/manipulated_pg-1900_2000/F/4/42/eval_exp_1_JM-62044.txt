Okay, let's start by reading through the text carefully. The text is an introduction to a story about squirrels and their relationship with humans, discussing topics like domestication, animal rights, and the author's personal experiences. 

First, I need to evaluate the fluency. Fluency issues would include grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Let me scan the text for any errors.

Looking at the first paragraph: "the animal as may was due to the influence of the mind of man in the process of domestication." The phrase "as may was due" seems incorrect. It should probably be "as may be due." That's a grammar issue.

Next: "it is hardly saying too much to say that the greater part of the power which is very like that of reasoning in the domestic animals is the result of human influence." The structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe "it is hardly an overstatement to say that the greater part..." would be smoother. So this is a syntax issue.

In the third paragraph: "The numerous expressions of pleasure at the reading of my history of two pet squirrels, printed in the Century Magazine several years ago, persuaded me..." The phrase "the reading of my history" is a bit awkward. "The positive responses to my story" would be clearer. So that's a word choice/lexicon issue.

Another part: "I have little respect for the Christianity or humanity of any one who has no thought to spare the lower creatures useless pain." The phrase "no thought to spare the lower creatures useless pain" is a bit confusing. It should be "no thought to spare the lower creatures from useless pain." So that's a grammar and clarity issue.

Looking at the fifth paragraph: "I do not discuss the question; I feel for myself, and conform my own conduct to my feelings, without pretending to prescribe for others." The semicolon here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit complex. Maybe a period would be better. However, it's still understandable, so maybe just a minor syntax issue.

In the sixth paragraph: "The cultivation of feelings of tenderness towards their kind might well repay, in the large account of profit and loss, the teaching children to made pets of wild creatures..." The phrase "made pets" should be "make pets." That's a spelling/grammar issue.

Another part: "I cannot justify keeping any animal in a cage or in a manner which makes a normal activity impossible." The phrase "a manner which" is correct, but "a way that" might be more natural. However, it's still acceptable, so maybe a minor syntax issue.

In the ninth paragraph: "The squirrel, if taken young, could be made to enjoy his domestication so completely that he makes no attempt to escape..." The shift from "could be made" (passive) to "he makes" (active) is a bit jarring. It should be consistent. Maybe "he would make no attempt to escape." So that's a syntax issue.

Moving to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, transitions, structure, and clarity of ideas. 

The text starts with a general discussion about animal intelligence, then moves to the author's personal experiences with squirrels, then shifts to the ethics of keeping animals, and finally addresses the impact of squirrels on forests. The transitions between these sections are a bit abrupt. For example, after discussing the benefits of loving animals, the author suddenly shifts to the objection about keeping pets, which is a new idea without much transition. That's a transition issue.

Another point: The author introduces the idea of the squirrel's impact on forests in the later paragraphs, but this is a new topic that wasn't foreshadowed earlier. This might confuse readers as it's a shift in focus. That's a structure issue.

The text also has some repetitive ideas, like the author's stance on animal rights and the benefits of loving animals. While repetition can emphasize a point, it might make the text feel redundant. That's a logic issue.

Additionally, the author uses a quote from a gamekeeper to support the argument, but the transition into that quote is a bit abrupt. It would have been better to introduce the quote with a smoother transition. That's another transition issue.

Overall, the text is coherent in that the ideas are related and the author's main points are clear. However, the transitions between paragraphs and the structure could be improved to enhance the flow. There are a few places where the logic is a bit disjointed, but the overall message is still understandable.

For fluency, the text has several grammatical and syntactical issues that affect readability, but they are not so severe as to make the text hard to understand. The author's message comes through despite the errors. 

For coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions and the structure that jumps between topics without clear links. However, the overall argument is still logical and the points are connected, so the coherence is mostly there but could be improved.
