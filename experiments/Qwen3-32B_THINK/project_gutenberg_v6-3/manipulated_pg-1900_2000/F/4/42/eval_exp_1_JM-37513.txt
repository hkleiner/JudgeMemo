Let me carefully evaluate this text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

## Fluency Evaluation

I need to look for issues related to syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] "I none the less felt assured that it had come to stay and to prevailed." - "prevailed" should be "prevail" to match the infinitive form after "to"
- [GRAMMAR] "I was a willing slave." - This is a bit ambiguous in meaning
- [GRAMMAR] "he inquired whether I had not learnt from Sartor Resartus" - "learnt" should be "learned" in American English
- [GRAMMAR] "I dimly suspected that the old gentleman... was ignorant of those recent developments of modern science with which I had been acquainted for weeks, nay more for months." - This is a very long sentence with complex structure that is difficult to follow
- [GRAMMAR] "Only by shutting one's eyes to the light that had been shed on the world by evolution could one failed to see how simple and yet how inevitable was the whole business." - "failed" should be "fail"
- [GRAMMAR] "the more heterogeneous the products--inorganic, organic, and superorganic, as I learnt to call them--the stronger the evidence for the law." - "learnt" should be "learned"
- [GRAMMAR] "the desired solution must be found. Thus we are led up to the statement" - There's a missing transition between these sentences
- [GRAMMAR] "the decomposition of every expended force into several forces has been perpetually producing a higher complication" - This sentence is complex and difficult to follow
- [GRAMMAR] "In all directions his investigations bring him face to face with the unknowable" - "unknowable" is missing an article
- [GRAMMAR] "the main principles was supplemented" - "was" should be "were"
- [GRAMMAR] "He proclaimed 'the gradual growth of all things by natural processes out of natural antecedents'." - The quotation is not properly formatted
- [GRAMMAR] "Are we not again and again bidden, now in forecast, now in retrospect, to looked below the surface" - "looked" should be "look"
- [GRAMMAR] "It is true that the affairs of the mind give pause and seem to present something of a difficulty." - This sentence is a bit awkward
- [GRAMMAR] "What more is required to round off the explanation of every thing, save the Unknowable--save the Ultimate Reality in which subject and object are united?" - "every thing" should be "everything"

Overall, the text has several grammatical errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few punctuation issues. However, these issues are not so severe that they make the text difficult to understand. The content is generally clear despite these issues.

## Coherence Evaluation

I need to assess the logical progression, connection of ideas, and overall structure.

Issues I notice:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and dense with philosophical content, making it challenging to follow the overall structure
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different philosophical concepts and ideas without always clearly connecting them
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are presented in a very abstract way that could be clearer
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas
- [LOGIC] The text presents complex philosophical arguments that may not be clearly explained for a general audience
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes shifts between different levels of analysis (biological, psychological, sociological) without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented but not fully developed or explained
- [CLARITY] The text uses complex vocabulary and concepts that may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with philosophy
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with multiple themes and ideas being presented without a clear progression
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient support or explanation
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses abstract concepts without clearly defining them

Despite these issues, the text does maintain a central theme about Spencer's philosophy of science and evolution. The author is trying to make a coherent argument about the importance of Spencer's work, and the content does follow a general progression from introduction to analysis to conclusion.

Based on my assessment:
- Fluency: The text has several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing, but it is generally readable. I would give it a score of 3.5 - it's generally readable but has multiple issues that interrupt the flow.
- Coherence: The text is dense with philosophical content and has some logical jumps and unclear transitions, but it maintains a central theme and overall argument. I would give it a score of 3.5 - it's generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments.
