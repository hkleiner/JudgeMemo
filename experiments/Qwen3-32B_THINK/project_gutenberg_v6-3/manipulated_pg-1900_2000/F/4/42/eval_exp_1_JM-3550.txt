Let me carefully evaluate the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll identify fluency issues (grammar, syntax, spelling, phrasing, punctuation, etc.):
1. [GRAMMAR] "It is at these places that one meets crowds of Parisians, and the daughters and wives of rich merchants from Bordeaux, with an admixture, now by no means inconsiderable, of Englishmen and Englishwomen." - This sentence is grammatically correct but has a complex structure that could be clearer.
2. [GRAMMAR] "And probably they will remain so; for though there are among them lovely valleys—and of all such the valley of Vernet is perhaps the most lovely—they cannot compete with the mountain scenery of other tourists-loved regions in Europe." - The use of em-dash without proper punctuation is inconsistent.
3. [GRAMMAR] "But there is one mountain among them which can claim to rank with the Píc du Midi or the Maledetta." - Missing article before "Píc du Midi" (should be "the Píc du Midi").
4. [GRAMMAR] "Their character in latter days does not seem to have changed, though their circle of admirers may perhaps was somewhat extended." - Subject-verb agreement issue ("was" should be "have been").
5. [GRAMMAR] "He or she who complain might left the place at a moment’s notice if it so pleased them." - Verb tense issues ("complain" should be "complained", "left" should be "leave").
6. [GRAMMAR] "The power of made this answer came to her from the lowness of her prices;" - Subject-verb agreement issue ("made" should be "making" or "making of this answer").
7. [SPELLING] "The baths were taken at different hours according to medical advice, but the usual time was from five to seven in the morning. The déjeuner or early meal is at nine o'clock, the dinner was at four." - Inconsistent verb tense ("is" vs. "was").
8. [SPELLING] "Her eyebrows am large and bushy" - Subject-verb agreement issue ("am" should be "are").
9. [GRAMMAR] "It was thought by those who had analysed the subject that the great secret of Madame Bauche’s power lie in her green spectacles." - Subject-verb agreement issue ("lie" should be "lies").
10. [GRAMMAR] "One or two had died, others had am married;" - Subject-verb agreement issue ("had am married" should be "had been married").
11. [GRAMMAR] "He was now expected home again very speedily, much to his mother’s delight." - Slightly awkward phrasing.
12. [GRAMMAR] "That she was kind and gracious to her favourite child does not perhaps give much proof of her benevolence;" - Awkward phrasing and word order.
13. [GRAMMAR] "He had been sent to Paris to saw something of the world," - "saw" should be "see".
14. [GRAMMAR] "and remained there picking up some agricultural lore which it was thought might prove useful in the valley farms of Vernet." - Awkward phrasing and word order.

Now, I'll identify coherence issues:
1. [LOGIC] The text jumps from describing the setting to specific details about Madame Bauche and her establishment without clear transitions.
2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative sometimes shifts between different perspectives (descriptive, narrative, analytical) without clear markers.
3. [TRANSITION] The text often moves from one topic to another without clear transitional phrases.
4. [LOGIC] The flow of the narrative is occasionally disrupted by sudden shifts in focus (e.g., from describing the valley to the character of Madame Bauche).
5. [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain multiple clauses that make it difficult to follow the logical progression.
6. [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes presents information out of chronological order.
7. [CLARITY] The relationships between characters and events are sometimes unclear until later in the text.
8. [LOGIC] The text introduces several elements (the valley, the hotel, the characters) but doesn't always clearly establish their relationships.
9. [LOGIC] The cause-and-effect relationships between Madame Bauche's personality and the events that follow are not always clearly established.

Based on these issues, I'll now assign scores:

For Fluency:
The text contains several grammatical errors, some subject-verb agreement issues, and awkward phrasing. However, the overall text is generally readable and the errors don't completely disrupt comprehension. I would rate this as a 3.5 - the text has multiple grammatical issues that interrupt the flow and clarity in noticeable ways, but it's still generally understandable.

For Coherence:
The text has noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and some confusing segments. The narrative sometimes jumps between topics without clear connections, and the relationships between characters and events aren't always clearly established. I would rate this as a 3.5 - the text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.

Let me double-check my assessment:

Fluency - The text has multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow and clarity in noticeable ways, but it's still generally understandable. The errors are frequent enough to give it a 3.5 rather than a 4.

Coherence - The text has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience, but the overall narrative is still generally coherent. The structure is somewhat disjointed at times, but the story can still be followed.

My final scores:
Fluency: 3.5
Coherence: 3.5
