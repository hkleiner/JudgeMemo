Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

**Fluency Issues**:

1. [GRAMMAR] "The former type one mighted speak of as the legal or submissive type of mind" - "mighted" is incorrect, it should be "might"
2. [GRAMMAR] "The latter type of mind I mighted for contrast call the legislative, creative, organizing, or masterful type" - same issue with "mighted"
3. [SPELLING] "I speak of them as two distinct and distinguishable types mainly for convenience and in order to accentuated their distinction" - "accentuated" is incorrect, should be "accentuate"
4. [GRAMMAR] "I believe that it is not sufficiently recognized just how different in their consequences these two methods are, and just where their difference and where the failure to appreciate their difference takes one" - this sentence is awkwardly constructed with parallel structure issues
5. [GRAMMAR] "The wars of Plantagenet and Lancastrian England with France, for example, were based entirely upon a dummy claim, supported by obscure legal arguments, upon the crown of France" - this sentence is awkward and could be clearer
6. [SPELLING] "mediæval" is an archaic spelling that might be distracting to modern readers
7. [SPELLING] "æsthetic" is an archaic spelling that might be distracting to modern readers
8. [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences are quite long and could benefit from better punctuation to improve readability

**Coherence Issues**:

1. [LOGIC] The text begins with a clear thesis about two types of mind regarding the future, but the argument becomes increasingly abstract and philosophical without clearly establishing how these two types of mind impact the "discovery of the future" mentioned in the title
2. [CLARITY] The distinction between the two types of mind is clear early on, but the text becomes more convoluted as it continues, making it harder to follow the author's argument
3. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different examples (lawyers vs. creative minds, moral questions, promises, sexual morality, public affairs, wars) without clear transitions, making it feel somewhat disjointed
4. [LOGIC] The author makes a claim about these two types of mind being distinct but then acknowledges that most people occupy an intermediate position, which creates some logical tension
5. [LOGIC] The conclusion about the importance of choosing one type of mind over the other is somewhat abrupt and not as clearly connected to the earlier development of the argument

Based on these issues, I'll now assign scores:

For **Fluency**, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but these don't completely prevent understanding. The text is generally readable but has enough issues to prevent it from being highly fluent.

For **Coherence**, the text has a clear thesis early on but becomes more abstract and less clearly connected as it progresses. The argument is somewhat complex and the examples jump around without clear transitions, which affects coherence.

Let me finalize my scores:

**Fluency Score**: I would rate this at 3.5. The text has multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow and clarity. While the text is generally readable, the errors are frequent enough to affect comprehension without effort.

**Coherence Score**: I would rate this at 3.5. The text has a clear thesis at the beginning but becomes more abstract and less clearly connected as it progresses. The argument is somewhat complex and the examples jump around without clear transitions, which affects coherence but doesn't make the text completely incoherent.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The argument about two types of mind becomes increasingly abstract without clearly establishing how they impact the "discovery of the future" mentioned in the title
- [CLARITY] The distinction between the two types of mind is clear at first but becomes more convoluted as the text progresses
