Let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues

I'll go through the text and identify any grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, or punctuation issues.

1. "[SPELLING] 'has been founded the series of' - This should be 'has founded the series of' to maintain subject-verb agreement.

2. "[SYNTAX] 'In whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures devoted to the fostering of Hebraic thought and learning' - This is an awkward passive construction that could be clearer as 'The series of Lectures devoted to the fostering of Hebraic thought and learning has been founded in whose memory'.

3. "[GRAMMAR] 'He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked...' - The first part of the sentence uses present tense ('are') but then switches to past tense ('was') for Lord Acton. It should be consistent.

4. "[SPELLING] 'Hebrew is one example among many of a language outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech.' - This sentence is awkwardly worded and could be clearer.

5. "[SPELLING] 'The ritual of the religion of Isis in Greece was, at the same period, conducted in an unknown tongue.' - The word "Isis" should be "Isis" (no change needed).

6. "[SPELLING] 'In any Roman Catholic church in London to-day you will found the service conducted in a language which, if understand at all by the general body of the congregation, has been learn by them only for the purposes of the liturgy.' - There are multiple errors here: "found" should be "find," "understand" should be "understood," and "learn" should be "learned."

7. "[SYNTAX] 'We may join in hoping that again in Palestine Hebrew may recover something of its old supremacy in the field of morals and of intellect.' - This is a somewhat awkward phrasing.

8. "[SPELLING] 'Part of the profits that accrued from the publication of his edition of "The Services of the Synagogue" has been devoted to the formation of a fund from which would be defrayed the expenses--after the first--of a series of annual lectures on subjects of Jewish interest, to be delivered by men of various schools of thought.' - This sentence is very long and complex, making it difficult to follow.

9. "[SPELLING] 'We are fortunate that the initial lecture is to was delivered to-day by the most distinguished of lived Jewish men of letters.' - "Was" should be "be," and "lived" should be "living."

10. "[SPELLING] 'David, who is promised of God that his seed shall was enthroned for ever, slew surrendered Moabites in cold blood' - "was" should be "be."

11. "[SPELLING] 'And this German God, like the popular idea of Jehovah, is a "Man of War" who demands "eye for eye, tooth for tooth," and cries with savage sublimity:--' - The punctuation here is a bit awkward with the em dash after the colon.

12. "[SPELLING] 'Thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations but they shall not rule over thee.' - This is a quote from the Bible and should be in italics or quotation marks.

13. "[SPELLING] 'And here we see the absurdity of judged the Bible outside its historic conditions' - "judged" should be "judging."

14. "[SPELLING] 'Said James Hinton, "The Bible needs interpreting by Nature even as Nature by it." - The sentence structure is a bit awkward.

15. "[SYNTAX] 'Maimonided but made confusion worse confounded when by allegations of allegory.' - This sentence is awkwardly worded and seems to be missing a verb or two.

## Coherence Issues

Now let me look for issues with logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure:

1. "[LOGIC] The text jumps from discussing Arthur Davis to a general discussion of ritual languages and then back to Davis. This creates an abrupt transition that could be smoothed.

2. "[STRUCTURE] The text introduces multiple examples of ritual languages from different cultures and time periods without a clear organizing principle or logical progression.

3. "[LOGIC] The text discusses the revival of Hebrew in Palestine but doesn't clearly connect this to the earlier discussion of Arthur Davis or his work.

4. "[STRUCTURE] The text moves from a biography of Arthur Davis to a discussion of the concept of a "Chosen People," which is a significant shift in topic that could be better transitioned.

5. "[LOGIC] The text presents a negative view of the concept of a "Chosen People" but doesn't clearly connect this to the earlier positive portrayal of Arthur Davis.

6. "[STRUCTURE] The text discusses various historical examples of ritual languages but doesn't clearly tie these together or show how they relate to the main theme.

7. "[LOGIC] The text presents a number of negative examples of Jewish behavior in the Bible but doesn't clearly address the context or intent of these passages.

8. "[STRUCTURE] The text shifts from a historical discussion to a philosophical or interpretive discussion without clear transitions.

9. "[LOGIC] The text suggests that the concept of a "Chosen People" needs to be interpreted through a naturalistic lens but doesn't clearly explain how this interpretation works or why it's necessary.

10. "[STRUCTURE] The text moves from a discussion of historical examples to a philosophical discussion without clear transitions or signposting.

Now, I'll evaluate the fluency and coherence scores based on the issues I've identified.

For fluency, I notice several spelling and grammar errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few complex sentences that are difficult to follow. However, the text is generally readable and the meaning is clear despite these issues. I would rate this as a 3.5 - there are multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways, but the text is generally readable.

For coherence, I notice some logical jumps, shifts in topic, and lack of clear transitions between different sections of the text. The text moves between different topics (Arthur Davis, ritual languages, the concept of a "Chosen People") without always making the connections clear. However, the text is generally coherent and the main ideas are present. I would rate this as a 3 - the text is generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
