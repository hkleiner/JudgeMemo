Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. I need to look for any issues related to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll go through the text and note any obvious problems. The text is quite long, so I'll focus on the most significant issues.

Looking at the first paragraph: "One day--it was neither in war time nor during manoeuvres--on a July morning..." The em dashes here are used correctly, but the sentence is a bit complex. However, it's still clear. 

Next, "When this hurricane of horses and men had, like a blazing meteor, devastated and laid low the splendid gold of the crops, two men remained behind..." The comma placement after "had" might be a bit awkward, but it's still understandable. 

In the sentence: "The latter had achieved his object. Thanks to long insistence and the payment of indemnities, he had brought about the passage of cavalry across that field..." The transition between sentences is smooth, but "object" here might be a bit old-fashioned, but it's not incorrect. 

Then: "1807, of how stood grain looks after it had been crushed..." This part seems to be a fragment. The number "1807" is placed in the middle of the sentence, which disrupts the flow. It might be a misplaced element. 

In the section about Meissonier's early years: "The father of Meissonier was a dealer in colonial products and chemicals, and kept a drug and provision shop in the Rue des Ecouffes." The structure is okay, but "kept a drug and provision shop" could be rephrased for clarity. 

Looking at: "The press, the art clubs, not to mention the salons, were all more or less divided between the romantics and the classicists, the innovators and the traditionalists, and fanned the flames of a quarrel which, in view of the worth of the two leaders--one of whom spell genius and the other perfection--was destined to appear without sanction to the eyes of posterity." The phrase "one of whom spell genius" has a grammatical error; it should be "spells" or "spelled." 

Another example: "It was not long afterwards, thanks to a dogged persistence, that the lad had overcome paternal opposition and was allowed to do head studies in charcoal, at the studio of a certain Julien Petier, whose slender artistic fame rested solely upon the fact that, once upon a time, he won the grand prix de Rome." The word "dogged persistence" is correct, but the sentence is long and complex, which might affect fluency. 

In the part about Meissonier's first exhibition: "In this picture one may find, I will not said in miniature (since all his paintings am destined to be contained in narrow limits) but in a youthful way, an indication of those qualities of relief and of realism..." The phrase "I will not said" is incorrect; it should be "I will not say." Also, "am destined" should be "are destined." 

There are also some missing commas, like in "The father of Meissonier was a dealer in colonial products and chemicals and kept a drug and provision shop..." which could be "and kept" without a comma, but it's not a major issue. 

Overall, the text has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but it's still mostly readable. The errors are not so frequent as to make the text difficult to understand. 

Now for coherence. The text is a biography of Meissonier, structured into chapters. The flow is generally logical, moving from his early life to his career. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from the anecdote in the introduction to his early years is smooth, but some parts jump between different aspects of his life without clear transitions. 

In the section about his early years, the narrative moves from his father's occupation to his mother's influence, then to his education and struggles. The connections between these sections are clear, but the transition from his childhood to his apprenticeship is a bit abrupt. 

Another issue is the use of the phrase "1807, of how stood grain looks..." which is confusing and disrupts the coherence. The mention of the year in the middle of the sentence without proper context makes it hard to follow. 

The text also has some repetitive elements, such as the repeated emphasis on Meissonier's dedication to realism, which is consistent but could be seen as redundant. 

There's a mention of "the Expedition into Egypt" in the context of Cogniet's studio, but the connection to Meissonier's work isn't clearly explained, leading to a minor confusion. 

Overall, the text maintains a logical progression, but some parts have abrupt shifts or unclear references that affect coherence. However, the main ideas are presented in a structured manner, so the impact on overall coherence is moderate.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "one of whom spell genius" (should be "spelled" or "spells")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I will not said" (should be "I will not say")  
- [GRAMMAR] "am destined" (should be "are destined")  
- [SYNTAX] "1807, of how stood grain looks..." (fragment; misplaced numerical reference)  
- [SPELLING] "manoeuvres" (British spelling; not an error but may affect consistency in some contexts)  
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with excessive subclauses (e.g., "The press... destined to appear without sanction...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from anecdote in introduction to biographical details in "Early Years" chapter  
- [LOGIC] Unclear reference to "1807" in mid-sentence disrupts narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous connection between Meissonier's studio experiences and his later artistic focus (e.g., "Expedition into Egypt" reference)  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of themes (realism, dedication) without clear progression or new insights  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from childhood anecdotes to apprenticeship details with minimal transitional phrasing  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
