Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues, following the instructions carefully.

# Fluency Issues

I'll go through the text and identify any problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] "The etymology of the name Romsey has been much disputed. There can be no doubt about the meaning of the termination "ey"--island--which we meet with under different spellings in many place-names, such as Athelney, Ely, Lundy, Mersea and others..." - The sentence is run-on and lacks proper punctuation.
- [GRAMMAR] "Now it is true that there were several important Roman stations in the neighbourhood: Sorbiodunum (Old Sarum), Brige (Broughton), Venta Belgarum (Winchester), and Clausentum (near Southampton), and in passing to and fro between these the Roman legions must frequently have march either through or near to the site of Romsey." - "must frequently have march" should be "must frequently have marched".
- [GRAMMAR] "The reader can formed his own opinion as to which is the most probable of these three suggestions." - "can formed" should be "can form".
- [GRAMMAR] "It is said that about two centuries earlier there had am a monastery at Nursling nearer the mouth of the Test..." - "had am" should be "had been a".
- [GRAMMAR] "Eadward's eldest daughter Ælflæd and her sister Æthelhild both adopted the religious life, and lived for a time at the monastery at Wilton. Here Æthelhild was buried, while Ælflæd was buried at Romsey." - This is a run-on sentence and could use better punctuation.
- [GRAMMAR] "and it is highly probable that Ælflæd ruled as abbess over the sister establishment at Romsey. Probably this was only a small religious community." - The transition between these sentences is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "The Abbey of Romege he feffed richely" - "feffed richely" seems to be a misspelling of "founded richly".
- [GRAMMAR] "The church restored after the raid mentioned above probably remained untouched until after the Conquest, when possibly the apsidal east end was built." - This is a run-on sentence.
- [GRAMMAR] "It would seem that about 1120 the present church was begin, as usual from the east." - "was begin" should be "was begun".
- [GRAMMAR] "This was enter by two arches, which may still be seen leading out of the ambulatory." - "was enter" should be "was entered".
- [GRAMMAR] "The three western bays am added in the thirteenth century..." - "am added" should be "were added".
- [GRAMMAR] "The church shows specimens of Norman, Early English, and Decorated work, all of the best periods of the style..." - "the style" is vague and lacks context.
- [GRAMMAR] "We know that Mary, the daughter of his brother, King Stephen, was abbess from about 1155 until she break her vows..." - "she break" should be "she broke".
- [GRAMMAR] "What more likely, then, than that Mary should consult her uncle, known to was a great builder..." - "known to was" should be "known to be".
- [GRAMMAR] "In the time of Juliana, who probably succeeded Mary, and was certainly abbess for about thirty years before her death in 1199, the transitional work in the clerestory of the nave was carried out." - This is a very long and complex sentence that could be simplified.
- [GRAMMAR] "It had been said that little Perpendicular work is to be seen in Romsey Abbey." - This sentence is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

# Coherence Issues

Now I'll look at the overall flow and logical structure of the text.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the chronological flow.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information in a disjointed manner, such as when it discusses the Roman coins found in the area but then abruptly shifts to a different topic.
- [CLARITY] Some historical events and relationships are not clearly explained, making it difficult for the reader to understand the connections between different elements.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions several derivations for the name "Romsey" but does not clearly explain the reasoning behind each derivation or how they relate to one another.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear sectioning or paragraphing to help organize the information, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information in a circular or repetitive manner, such as when it discusses the rebuilding of the abbey after the Danish raids.
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses archaic or obscure language (e.g., "eleventh century church within them") that may be confusing to modern readers.
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between discussing the physical structure of the abbey and its historical context without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain too much information at once, making it difficult to understand the main points.
- [STRUCTURE] The text ends abruptly with "It had been said that little Perpendicular work is to be seen in Romsey Abbey," without completing the thought or providing a conclusion.

Based on my analysis, I'll now assign scores for fluency and coherence.

For fluency, the text contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that would make reading difficult in places, but it's still generally readable. I would give it a score of 3.5.

For coherence, the text has some logical flow and organization, but the structure is somewhat disjointed with abrupt shifts between topics and time periods. I would give it a score of 3.5 as well.

Let me double-check my evaluation to make sure I've captured all the issues and that my scores are appropriate.

The fluency issues I identified are mostly grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but the text is still generally readable. A score of 3.5 seems appropriate.

The coherence issues are more significant, as the text jumps between topics and time periods without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative. A score of 3.5 seems appropriate.

My final scores are:
- Fluency: 3.5
- Coherence: 3.5
