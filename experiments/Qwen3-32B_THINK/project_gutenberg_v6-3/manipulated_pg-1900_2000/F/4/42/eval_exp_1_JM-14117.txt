Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency issues. The text is from an older source, so some of the language might be a bit archaic. I need to check for grammar, spelling, and syntax. 

First, I notice some missing articles, like "The twentieth-century woman, in spite of her progressive and ambitious theories about woman's sphere of activity, has allowed her housekeeping methods to remain almost stationary..." The phrase "woman's sphere of activity" is a bit awkward. Then there's "has allowed her housekeeping methods to remain almost stationary" – "stationary" is correct here, but maybe "unchanged" would be more natural. 

Next, in the sentence "When confronted with this accusation, she asserts that the maintenance of a home is neither a business nor a profession..." The structure is okay, but the phrasing is a bit stiff. 

Looking further, "There are only a few women to-day who regard domestic science in the light of a profession..." "To-day" is written as one word now, but the original uses two. Also, "in the light of" is a bit old-fashioned. 

In the paragraph about marketing, "Marketing is also very generally attend to in person by the housewife..." The verb "attend to" should be "attended to." That's a grammar error. 

Then there's a sentence: "In spite of the 'rush of modern life,' a woman who has a home ought to was willing to gave some part of her time to its daily supervision." The verbs "was" and "gave" are incorrect. It should be "be willing to give." 

Another issue: "Eternal vigilance is the price of everything worth having. If she gave this she woulded not have so many tales of woe..." "Woulded" is incorrect; it should be "would not have." 

Now, checking for spelling: "coöperation" has a ligature "ö", which is outdated. It should be "cooperation." Also, "to was gradually losing" – "was" is incorrect; it should be "is." 

Moving on to coherence. The text is structured into chapters, which is good, but the flow between sections needs to be checked. The first chapter talks about causes of the problem, the second about the difficulty in finding help, and the third about disadvantages compared to other work. The structure is logical, but there are some abrupt transitions. 

For example, after discussing the housewife's lack of knowledge, the next paragraph jumps to marketing. The transition is a bit abrupt. Also, in the chapter on difficulty of obtaining women, the text shifts from the housewife's perspective to the employees' reasons without a smooth transition. 

Some ideas are repeated, like the housewife's failure to take responsibility, which is mentioned in multiple chapters. The argument builds on the same points, which might make the text feel redundant. 

The conclusion in the third chapter mentions the need for reform but doesn't clearly connect it back to the previous chapters. The flow from problem to solution is there, but the connection could be smoother. 

Overall, the text has a clear structure and logical progression, but some transitions are abrupt, and there's a bit of repetition. The main ideas are presented coherently, but the execution has some flaws.
