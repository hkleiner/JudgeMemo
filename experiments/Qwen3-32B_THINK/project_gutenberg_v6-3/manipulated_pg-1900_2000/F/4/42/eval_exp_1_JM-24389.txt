Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smooth and correct the writing is in terms of grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. I need to check for any errors that might make the text hard to read.

First, I notice a few spelling mistakes. For example, "have go out again" should probably be "had gone out again". Also, "You must knew this road" is incorrect; it should be "known". There's a missing apostrophe in "you'd", like in "you'd like to shoot". 

Looking at grammar, there's a sentence that says "Marche, washing his tingled fingers and visage in icy water..." "Tingled" might be a typo; maybe it should be "tingling". Also, "He was that kind of a friendly young man..." uses "a" after "kind of", which is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward. 

Syntax issues: Some sentences are a bit long and run-on. For example, "It had been the affectation of the wealthy men composing the Foam Island Duck Club to exist almost primitively when on the business of duck shooting, in contradistinction to the overfed luxury of other millionaires inhabiting other more luxuriously appointed shooting-boxes along the Chesapeake." This is a complex sentence that might be harder to follow. 

Word choice: "Delectable odors from the kitchen put him into better humor" â€“ "delectable" is a bit unusual here; "delicious" might be more common. Also, "You'll be old enough to have a gun very soon, Jim. How would you like to shoot a real, live wild duck?" The phrase "real, live wild duck" is correct but a bit redundant. 

Now for coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow and connect logically. The story starts with Marche and Jim driving, then moves into their conversation, and then to the sister. The transition from the journey to the house is smooth. However, there's a part where Marche is thinking about the club and his reasons for coming, which might be a bit abrupt. Also, the shift from the conversation with the sister to the business discussion is a bit sudden. 

There's a section where the sister's inner thoughts are described: "But she coulded not see through it; the pane only reflected her face darkly; and to her, for a moment, it seemed that way with her whole pent-up life..." The word "coulded" is incorrect and should be "could not". This error affects the flow. 

The ending part where they discuss the accounts and Jim's Latin grammar is a bit jarring after the more descriptive parts. The connection between Marche's curiosity about the sister's life and the business talk isn't very smooth. 

Overall, the fluency has several minor errors but is mostly readable. Coherence has some abrupt transitions but the story is generally logical and follows a clear progression. I'll rate fluency around 4 and coherence around 4 as well, considering the minor issues but the overall readability and structure.
