Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues

Looking at the text for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation problems:

- [GRAMMAR] "The year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the Fourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October of 1703" - This is a run-on sentence with a misplaced modifier.
- [GRAMMAR] "whilst the tipstaff to the king's palace, one François Prévost, signed solemnly as witness to the birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid morsel of humanity" - This sentence is awkwardly structured.
- [GRAMMAR] "The worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner to Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow, the law officer from the Police Court" - This sentence is awkwardly structured.
- [GRAMMAR] "The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs." - This sentence is awkwardly phrased.
- [GRAMMAR] "Then be with child, for about women Saturday, genial he François talk banter bit high was not, a morsel the to the therefore bound would politics; the and a the there of be, bored scamp back a infant would draw folk!" - This is a completely incoherent sentence with no clear structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste, and he had the courage to say so." - This sentence has awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste, and he had the courage to say so." - This sentence has awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "He appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like the three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of the Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his credit" - This sentence is awkwardly structured.
- [GRAMMAR] "Here we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in art, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to win the reputation and standing of a "serious painter," without which he could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in this his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris." - This is an incomplete sentence at the end.

# Coherence Issues

Looking at the text for logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections, clear progression, and consistent structure:

- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the birth of François Boucher to a description of Paris in 1703 without clear connection to the child's birth.
- [LOGIC] The narrative is sometimes confusing, such as when it shifts between different time periods and events without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Then be with child, for about women Saturday, genial he François talk banter bit high was not, a morsel the to the therefore bound would politics; the and a the there of be, bored scamp back a infant would draw folk!" is completely incoherent and doesn't connect to the rest of the narrative.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new characters or events without proper introduction or context.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes shifts focus without clear indication of the change.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs are long and contain multiple ideas without clear organization or transitions between them.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes references events or people without providing enough context for the reader to understand their significance.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes moves forward in time or introduces new information without clear indication of the timeline or context.

Now I'll assign scores based on these issues:

For fluency, the text has several grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but it is generally readable. There are some serious problems like the completely incoherent sentence, but the text still conveys the narrative. I would rate it a 3.5.

For coherence, the text has some logical issues, with abrupt shifts and confusing segments, but it generally maintains a narrative flow about the life of François Boucher. The incoherent sentence is particularly problematic, but the rest of the text has a clear progression. I would rate it a 3.5 as well.
