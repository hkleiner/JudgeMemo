Alright, let's start by analyzing the text for fluency and coherence issues. 

First, for fluency, I'll look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text has some odd phrasings like "consigning gods their generation parents the them pleasure takes from of a in special pedestals removing and, household to its the Each cupboard." This seems to be a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order and missing articles or prepositions. There are also run-on sentences and missing commas, such as "The prophet or pioneer, after being at first declared to be unintelligible or absurd, has a brief spell of popularity, after which he is said to be conventional, and then antiquated." The word "waggon" might be a typo for "wagon." Some sentences are awkwardly structured, like "The kindled had in or international; and been there Chauvinism in even fire of in ostensibly, under Spain of no the was the, banner Germany till the century anywhere patriotism French, had Jingoism, fighting humanity eighteenth Russia." This is a complete jumble.

Now, for coherence. The text discusses the Victorian Age and its historical context, but some parts are disjointed. For example, the paragraph about the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution is followed by a confusing sentence about "Then shook into Great a, followed social base slumbering of War its awakened, the and which structure vitality enthusiasm to intense the nationality." This doesn't logically follow the previous content. There's also a sudden shift from discussing the Industrial Revolution to the French monarchy and then to the English nation's condition in the eighteenth century without clear transitions. Some ideas are introduced but not fully explained, like the sudden mention of Dean Colet's family without context. The text also jumps between different topics without clear connections, making the overall flow choppy and hard to follow.

Considering the fluency issues, the text has several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some typos, which would lower the fluency score. For coherence, the disjointed ideas and lack of transitions make the text less coherent. Assigning scores, I'd say fluency is around 2.5 due to multiple issues that interrupt readability, and coherence is around 2.5 because of the noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections.
