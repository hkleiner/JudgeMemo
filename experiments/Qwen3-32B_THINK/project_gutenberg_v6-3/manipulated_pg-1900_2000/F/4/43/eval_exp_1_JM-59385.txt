Alright, let me start by evaluating the fluency of this text. First, I'll look for any grammar issues. There are a few instances where the sentence structure is awkward or unclear. For example, the sentence "Wong each, with, the both chess which slowly ’s his toward yield at Lui each too carefully loved dearly of the players and, measuring to skill game, quoted from they power hisso the seasoned goal moved was other price." This is a run-on sentence with incorrect word order and missing punctuation. It's hard to parse and understand the intended meaning.

Next, I'll check for spelling errors. The word "hiss" is misspelled as "hiss" in "hisso the seasoned goal moved was other price." Also, "Lui each too carefully loved dearly of the players" has a misplaced modifier and unclear structure. 

Looking at syntax, there are several sentences that are overly complex and lack proper punctuation, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "In drifted crunching roses sound foreign had fragrant the principal and and the talk tenseness recalled in the the arbor she, out path again sit France she hadas to as voice Porter her spoken asking Kuei stiff of shoes, ’s the la and Miss shewalk the memory with down the, perfume end at come the of her ’s made of to the came Ping." This is a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order and missing punctuation.

For lexicon, the author uses some archaic or formal language that may be less common in modern usage, but this doesn't necessarily detract from fluency. However, the inconsistent use of terms like "bargain" and "bargained" could be confusing.

Moving on to coherence, I'll look for logical flow and transitions between ideas. The text generally maintains a clear progression, following the narrative of Kuei Ping's experience in the jewelry shop and her reflections on her education and future. However, there are a few abrupt shifts in the narrative. For example, the transition from the jewelry shop scene to the memory of the mission school is somewhat jarring and lacks a smooth transition. Additionally, the final paragraph about Kuei Ping's decision and her feelings towards Miss Porter is a bit abrupt and could use more context or explanation.

The structure of the text is generally well-organized, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the middle section with the jewelry bargaining process is a bit lengthy and could benefit from clearer transitions or paragraph breaks to improve readability. There are also a few instances of repetition, such as the repeated references to the pearls and the mission school, which could be tightened up.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, with a few minor issues that could be improved. The narrative flows reasonably well, but there are a few points where the reader might need to pause to understand the connections between ideas.

Now, let me summarize the fluency and coherence issues and assign scores based on the given criteria.

For fluency:
- There are several grammar issues, including run-on sentences and incorrect word order.
- There are spelling errors and awkward phrasing.
- The text has complex sentences that are difficult to follow due to missing punctuation.

For coherence:
- There are a few abrupt transitions in the narrative.
- The structure could be improved with clearer transitions and paragraph breaks.
- There is some repetition that could be tightened up.

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5 and the coherence as a 4.0. The text is generally readable but has enough issues to interrupt the flow and clarity. The coherence is mostly good with a few areas for improvement.
