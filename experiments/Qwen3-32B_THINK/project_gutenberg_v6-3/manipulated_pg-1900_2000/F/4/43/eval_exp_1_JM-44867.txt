Let me analyze the text and identify issues related to fluency and coherence according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I'll examine the text for fluency issues (grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "The yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are." This sentence has serious grammatical problems and is ungrammatical.
- [GRAMMAR] "The of obey would it legal the mind sacrifice would, the past creative unhesitatingly type to unhesitatingly the future." This sentence is severely ungrammatical and incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "In two work looking equally out affairs incompatible of things divergent ways at also public sphere into the and these of consequences." This sentence is a jumbled collection of words with no grammatical structure.
- [SPELLING] "mediæval" - This is an archaic or non-standard spelling of "medieval."
- [SPELLING] "æsthetic" - This is an alternative but less common spelling of "aesthetic."
- [PUNCTUATION] The text lacks proper paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are missing periods and other punctuation marks in several places.
- [PUNCTUATION] The title is written in all caps without proper punctuation.

Now, I'll examine the text for coherence issues (logical sequencing, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities):

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text discusses two types of mind (past-oriented vs. future-oriented) but doesn't consistently maintain this distinction throughout the text.
- [LOGIC] The text introduces a concept and then fails to clearly connect it to the next concept, making the overall argument sometimes confusing.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different examples and ideas without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced but not fully explained or developed.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between ideas without adequate transitional phrases.
- [TRANSITION] The text sometimes introduces new examples or ideas without clearly connecting them to the previous content.

Now, I'll score the text according to the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency:
The text has several serious grammatical errors, particularly in two sentences that are completely ungrammatical. There are also spelling and punctuation issues. While the rest of the text is generally well-written, these significant errors would lower the fluency score. I would rate it a 3.5 - it's generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow.

For Coherence:
The text presents a complex philosophical argument about different mindsets regarding time. While the central thesis is clear, there are some logical gaps and transitions that could be smoother. The structure is mostly coherent, but the argument occasionally meanders and lacks clear transitions between some sections. I would rate it a 4 - mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are." - [GRAMMAR] "The of obey would it legal the mind sacrifice would, the past creative unhesitatingly type to unhesitatingly the future." - [GRAMMAR] "In two work looking equally out affairs incompatible of things divergent ways at also public sphere into the and these of consequences." - [SPELLING] "mediæval" - [SPELLING] "æsthetic" - [PUNCTUATION] Missing periods and other punctuation marks - [PUNCTUATION] Lack of proper paragraph breaks - [PUNCTUATION] Title in all caps without proper punctuation

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Inconsistent maintenance of the past-oriented vs. future-oriented mind distinction - [LOGIC] Disconnected concepts and ideas - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between examples and ideas - [CLARITY] Some concepts introduced but not fully explained - [TRANSITION] Missing transitional phrases between ideas - [TRANSITION] New examples introduced without clear connections to previous content

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
