Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency. I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "Chin-t'a" might be a proper noun, but there are inconsistencies in diacritics and hyphens. Also, "Chint'a" appears later without the hyphen. There's a typo in "ol" instead of "of" in "the outlines ol which could be discerned". 

Looking at syntax and structure, some sentences are run-on or awkwardly structured. For example, "The great high road -- joining K'ou-li (the territory inside the Great Wall) and K'ou-wai (the territory outside) has in North Kansu an E-W direction..." The dash and parentheses make it hard to follow. There are also missing commas, like after "K'ou-wai (the territory outside)".

Word choice and phrasing issues: "a strange costume such as I had never seen before" is okay, but "I dismounted to get a nearer view of three women who were busy in the yard of the house." The phrase "of the house" is redundant since the yard is part of the house. Also, "The Sarö Yögur has not much in the way of clothes." The use of "has" when referring to the people is incorrect; it should be "have".

Now for coherence. The text is a travelogue, so the flow should be logical. The narrative sometimes jumps between descriptions of the environment and the Yögur people without smooth transitions. For example, after describing the landscape, it abruptly shifts to the village and its people. 

There are some unclear transitions. For instance, the paragraph about the legend of Shiche-Hache is introduced with "A legend, imparted from father to son..." but it's unclear how this connects to the previous context. Also, the section about the temple and lamas is detailed, but the connection between the temple's description and the Yögur people's customs isn't clearly established.

Some parts are repetitive. The mention of Chinese style in clothing and architecture is repeated multiple times. Also, the text occasionally goes into too much detail about specific items (like the head dress) without linking them to broader themes, which can disrupt the flow.

Overall, the fluency has several issues but the text is mostly readable. Coherence has some problems with transitions and structure but the overall narrative is understandable. I'll assign scores based on these observations.
