Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "It is of to Russia was which the took to period from during unprepared Russia mobilize it fact forces a, six for months two weeks that" - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect. It seems like words are jumbled.

2. [GRAMMAR] "During of of these millions were for Russia inaction months yet forced not Teutons those by two Frenchmen million, 40 was faced 122 only ready." - This sentence is also grammatically incorrect and incoherent.

3. [GRAMMAR] "It is true that for the complete realization of this scheme it was necessary that the Austrian Army, as well, involve France." - This sentence has a grammatical issue with the structure "it was necessary that the Austrian Army, as well, involve France."

4. [GRAMMAR] "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia towards the end of the War are obscuring the true historic role of Russia in the sanguine World struggle." - The phrase "sanguine World struggle" is awkward and potentially incorrect. "Sanguine" means hopeful or optimistic, which doesn't fit well with "World struggle."

5. [GRAMMAR] "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps of the first three years of the War, maps which speak only of two principal fronts, the French and the Russian, and no other--to grasp the significance of the gigantic role played in this War by great Russia and the millions of sacrifices she consecrated to the common cause of the Allies." - This sentence is very long and has awkward phrasing.

6. [SPELLING] "sanguine" - This word appears to be used incorrectly in the context. It might be a typo for "sanguinary" (bloody) or "sanguine" is being used incorrectly.

7. [SPELLING] "Roumania" - This is an older spelling; the modern spelling is "Romania."

8. [SPELLING] "Bolshevist" - This is not the standard form; it should be "Bolshevik."

9. [SPELLING] "belligerents" - This word is spelled correctly but is used in a somewhat awkward context.

10. [PUNCTUATION] There are several places where punctuation is missing or used incorrectly, particularly in the long, complex sentences.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from the introduction to a detailed analysis without a clear transition, making it feel disjointed.

2. [LOGIC] The text presents historical facts and arguments in a somewhat disjointed manner, with some cause-and-effect relationships not clearly explained.

3. [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt, with little to no transitional phrases to connect ideas.

4. [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation, making it difficult for the reader to fully understand the context.

5. [LOGIC] The text occasionally presents multiple arguments without clearly distinguishing between them, which can confuse the reader.

6. [STRUCTURE] The second chapter appears to be a continuation of the first, but there is no clear indication of this in the formatting or structure.

7. [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes assumptions about the reader's knowledge of the historical context without providing necessary background information.

8. [CLARITY] The text contains some complex, multi-clause sentences that make it difficult to follow the main points.

9. [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents historical facts in a way that seems to support a particular political or ideological viewpoint without acknowledging alternative perspectives.

10. [COHESION] The text occasionally loses focus, with paragraphs that start with one idea but end with another.

Now let me score the text:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors, some of which are quite severe (like the completely incoherent sentences). It also has some spelling issues and awkward phrasing. However, most of the text is still readable and follows standard English conventions. I would rate it a 3.5 on the fluency scale. The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity.

**Coherence Score:**
The text presents a clear argument about Russia's role in World War I, but it has some issues with logical flow, transitions, and organization. The ideas are generally connected, but the presentation is sometimes disjointed. I would rate it a 3.5 on the coherence scale. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
