Alright, let's evaluate this text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria.

## Fluency Evaluation:

I'll go through the text and identify fluency issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice problems.

1. [GRAMMAR] "In the calling feet and of confusion boys roar of, multitudes rose talking stamping other shouting was moment of to each a in and station a voices above, eager, the many the there." - This sentence is a complete grammatical mess with no clear subject or verb.

2. [SYNTAX] "They party children exquisitely other each, at a gravely looked like two, dumb, at thrilled." - The syntax is completely broken, making this sentence incomprehensible.

3. [GRAMMAR] "And opposite among a, one the himself instead name,--Leonard Missing a of Leeds,--one others three name just list Wounded; words Dead might have written and of of been of, each, it, hundreds." - This is a grammatically incorrect run-on sentence with no clear meaning.

4. [SYNTAX] "He asked, 'Is it pink?' he or, 'so in only it does this asked look light? It feels awfully downy and nice.'" - This sentence has incorrect syntax and is confusing.

5. [SPELLING] "Ia 'm mess I, rather expect," - This appears to be a misspelling of "I am a mess, I rather expect."

6. [SYNTAX] "onit and to up fixed, this, awfully It way tough no; or anything new 's honey have clothes, you," - This sentence is completely incoherent with broken syntax.

7. [SPELLING] "panting close to the gate-rail" - This might be a spelling issue, though it could also be a period-specific term.

8. [SYNTAX] "The field where lay the young dead was their place in the sun." - The syntax is awkward and confusing.

9. [GRAMMAR] "The still hospital where lay the maimed was their part in a civilization whose sincerity they had trusted as little children trust in the perfection of their parents." - This sentence has grammatical issues with "where lay" and awkward construction.

10. [SYNTAX] "Beside the army of maimed and fallen boys was another shadowy army of girls in their teens and sweet early twenties--the unclaimed contemporaries of a buried generation." - The syntax is awkward and the sentence is confusing.

Based on these issues, the text has multiple serious fluency problems that significantly impact readability. While the majority of the text is well-written, these errors are frequent and distracting. I would give a score of 2.5 for fluency.

## Coherence Evaluation:

Now let's look at how the story unfolds as a whole and identify coherence issues:

1. [LOGIC] The text has a confusing segment: "In the calling feet and of confusion boys roar of, multitudes rose talking stamping other shouting was moment of to each a in and station a voices above, eager, the many the there." - This sentence breaks the logical flow of the narrative.

2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is disrupted by the incoherent passage about the soldiers and the war, which seems out of place compared to the romantic narrative.

3. [LOGIC] The transition from the wedding story to the philosophical discussion about war and its impact on young people is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.

4. [LOGIC] The text shifts from a personal story to a broader commentary on war without clear transitions, making the narrative feel disjointed.

5. [CLARITY] The passage about the soldiers and their experiences is confusing and lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow the author's point.

6. [LOGIC] The final segment about the child entering the room seems to have a logical disconnect with the previous philosophical discussion.

Despite these issues, the core narrative about Marjorie and Leonard's wedding is coherent. The major problems are in specific sections that disrupt the overall flow. I would give a coherence score of 3.5, as the text is generally coherent but has noticeable issues that affect the reading experience.

Let me summarize my findings and provide the final scores.
