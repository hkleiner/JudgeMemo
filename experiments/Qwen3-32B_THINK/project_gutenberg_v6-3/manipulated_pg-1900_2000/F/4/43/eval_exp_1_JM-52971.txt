Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency Issues. The text has some obvious grammatical problems. For example, in the first chapter, there's a sentence that says "First, without the help, comments and criticism of Erik Reed this paper would have been nought." The word "nought" is archaic and might not be commonly used, which could be a lexicon issue. Then there's a part that says "The persons listed in the bibliography represent the true basis of learning and I unhesitatingly refer one and all to them." The word "unhesitatingly" is misspelled hereâ€”it should be "unhesitatingly" without the 't' before 'ly'. That's a spelling issue.

Looking at syntax, there's a sentence: "each more and cultural must of than with group of one deal we people influences outside group." This seems like a jumbled sentence where the structure is all over the place. The words are in the wrong order, making it hard to understand. That's a syntax problem. 

Another example is "There appears to be a long time-lag between Early Man and our next group, the Basketmakers." The hyphen in "time-lag" is correct, but the sentence could be clearer. However, the bigger issue is in the next paragraph where it says "Positive proof indicates that the Basketmakers were here before 900 A.D., and possibly as early as 4000 years ago." The phrase "as early as 4000 years ago" is a bit awkward. It's better to say "as early as 4000 years ago" but maybe the structure is okay. 

In the section about the Apaches, the sentence "Whether they exerted pressure on the Basketmakers we do not know." is correct, but the placement of the verb might be a bit off. It should be "Whether they exerted pressure on the Basketmakers, we do not know." The missing comma could be a punctuation issue. 

Now for Coherence Issues. The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Basketmakers, the text moves to the Apaches and then to the Comanches without explaining how these groups relate to each other or the main topic of the Carlsbad Caverns. That's a logic problem. 

Another point is the section on the cave exploration by the Indians. The author mentions physical evidence but then says, "It is very unlikely that they ventured beyond the now Bat Cave section of the cave for several logical reasons." The transition to explaining the reasons is abrupt, and the connection between the evidence and the reasoning isn't clearly explained. That's a structure issue. 

There's also a part where the author talks about the superstitious nature of the Indians keeping them out of the cave but then introduces a myth about Guiana Indians. This seems like an irrelevant addition that doesn't connect to the main argument, causing a clarity problem. 

The text also has some repetition, like discussing the lack of agriculture in the area multiple times. This repetition could confuse the reader about the main points, which is a coherence issue. 

In the section on the Carlsbad Basketmakers, the author mentions pottery changes and physical changes of the people but doesn't clearly link these to the main narrative about their disappearance. This lack of connection affects the overall coherence. 

Putting this all together, the Fluency score would be a 3 because there are multiple grammatical and syntactical issues that disrupt the flow. For Coherence, the text has several issues with logical structure and transitions, so a score of 3 seems appropriate.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "each more and cultural must of than with group of one deal we people influences outside group" (incoherent word order)
- [GRAMMAR] "Positive proof indicates that the Basketmakers were here before 900 A.D., and possibly as early as 4000 years ago" (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "unhesitatingly" misspelled as "unhesitatingly"
- [SYNTAX] "The from their so they and long got southward career way been working the bloody and doing horses had in Apaches A.D. 1300 the, sometime, from under slowly, after acquired and trade By Apaches the of Spanish theft way" (incoherent sentence structure)
- [LEXICON] "nought" (archaic/obsolete word usage)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between unrelated topics (e.g., Apache history to bat mythology)
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed paragraph transitions without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Unclear cause-effect relationships in archaeological interpretations
- [LOGIC] Irrelevant tangent about Guiana Indian bat myths without contextual relevance
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jumps between Basketmaker history and cave exploration theories
