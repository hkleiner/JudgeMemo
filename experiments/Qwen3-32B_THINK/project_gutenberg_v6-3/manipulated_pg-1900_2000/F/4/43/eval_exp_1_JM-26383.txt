Let me evaluate the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "The friends daughters great eager charge of wife his, of to his affliction take, relations and numerous, proved who were but was a death his." - This sentence is completely ungrammatical and incoherent.
   
2. [GRAMMAR] "Anna the estimated us talents the required appeared he her poetess “adds” reasoning to, did dazzled who to mind; Honora his that Seward highly tells that Honora be “but not he” possess by." - This sentence is extremely ungrammatical and incoherent.

3. [GRAMMAR] "In 1821 his body was, on the petition of the Duke of York, brought to England." - This sentence has awkward phrasing and word order.

4. [SPELLING] "Tappan" - This is likely a proper noun, but it doesn't appear to be spelled correctly for the historical event (André was hanged at Tappan, New York, so this is correct, but it might be confusing).

5. [SPELLING] "Bishton" - This is likely a proper noun, but it doesn't appear to be spelled correctly for the location (Bishton is a real place in Staffordshire, so this is correct).

6. [SPELLING] "Lichfield" is consistently spelled correctly throughout the text.

7. [PUNCTUATION] "He writes, “How am I honoured in Mr. and Mrs. Seward’s attachment to me!”" - The quotation mark placement is slightly off.

8. [PUNCTUATION] "The bier was decorated with garlands and flowers, as it was transported to the ship." - This is a clear sentence, but the comma usage is slightly awkward.

9. [PUNCTUATION] "On arrival in England the remains were first deposited in the Islip Chapel, and subsequently buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey, where the funeral service was celebrated, and where a monument was erected to his memory." - This sentence has excessive commas and could be clearer.

10. [PHRASING] "Mr. Seward attained some literary fame, and was co-adjutor to an edition of the works of Beaumont and Fletcher." - The phrase "was co-adjutor to an edition" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

11. [PHRASING] "The Cathedral, the Venus of Gothic creation, as now existing, was built piecemeal during the 13th and early part of 14th centuries." - The phrase "the Venus of Gothic creation" is a metaphor but the phrasing is awkward.

12. [PHRASING] "He once said, “My master whipt me very well. Without that, sir, I should have done nothing.”" - The phrase "whipt" is an archaic spelling that might confuse modern readers.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text has a significant coherence issue with the sentence: "The friends daughters great eager charge of wife his, of to his affliction take, relations and numerous, proved who were but was a death his." This sentence is completely incoherent and disrupts the logical flow.

2. [LOGIC] The sentence "Anna the estimated us talents the required appeared he her poetess “adds” reasoning to, did dazzled who to mind; Honora his that Seward highly tells that Honora be “but not he” possess by." is extremely incoherent and makes the text hard to follow.

3. [TRANSITION] The text jumps from discussing Honora Sneyd to Thomas Day and then to the Earl of Warwick without clear transitions between these different sections.

4. [CLARITY] The passage about Major André is well-structured but the incoherent sentences about Anna Seward's assessment of André's talents disrupt the flow and clarity of this section.

5. [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured with clear chapter divisions and chronological ordering of events, but the incoherent sentences significantly impact the overall coherence.

6. [CONSISTENCY] The text maintains a consistent focus on Anna Seward and her connections throughout, despite the incoherent sentences.

Now I'll score the text based on the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has two sentences that are completely incoherent and ungrammatical, which significantly impact fluency. There are also several other grammatical issues and awkward phrasing. Despite these issues, much of the text is well-written and readable. Given the significant issues with two sentences and some other problems, I would score it around a 3.5 on the fluency scale.

**Coherence Score:**
The text is generally well-structured and follows a logical progression, but the two completely incoherent sentences significantly disrupt the coherence. These sentences make it difficult to follow the narrative at those points. Despite these issues, the text maintains a clear focus and overall structure. I would score it around a 3.5 on the coherence scale.
