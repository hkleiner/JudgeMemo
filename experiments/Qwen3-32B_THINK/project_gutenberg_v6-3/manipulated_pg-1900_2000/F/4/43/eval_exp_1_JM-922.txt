Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency. I'll look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Churches crowded filled" - This phrase is grammatically incorrect. It should be "churches crowded and filled" or similar.
- [SPELLING] "suffocation well’ chapels are Dissenters are to" - This appears to be a spelling or punctuation error. The sentence is incoherent and doesn't make sense as written.
- [SYNTAX] "The preacher’s fervour increases, the perspiration starts upon his brow, his face is flushed, and he clenches his hands convulsively, as he draws a hideous and appalling picture of the horrors preparing for the wicked in a future state." - This is a long, run-on sentence that would benefit from being split into shorter, more digestible sentences.
- [PUNCTUATION] "He eternal preached stretches frantic torments aside out arms, and as of The interpreted the blasphemously, the his himself body by turn and gestures with calls thrusts, those with forth from upon word visit, his who pulpit Deity half—to." - This sentence is a jumbled mess with no clear punctuation, making it impossible to understand.
- [PUNCTUATION] "He hand is hard, which-in aspect the hymn Bible, faced black clad coarse, some concluding in from for while his and forbidding text a of plain passage man small his a, rusty he is bearing selects." - This sentence is also jumbled with no clear punctuation or structure.

Now, let's evaluate the text for coherence. I'll look for issues related to logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clarity of ideas, and overall structure.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from describing Sunday scenes in London to a detailed description of a religious service in a chapel. There's no clear transition between these sections.
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from one scene to another without clear organization or progression. The narrative lacks a clear structure or thematic organization.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the fashionable church to the less orthodox chapel is abrupt and lacks any connecting context or explanation.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the preacher and the religious service is extremely confusing and incoherent, making it difficult to understand the intended message.
- [LOGIC] The text begins with a positive description of Sunday scenes but then shifts to a negative portrayal of religious services, without clear logical connection or progression.
- [TRANSITION] The text shifts between different locations and perspectives without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.

Based on my evaluation, I would give the following scores:
For Fluency: The text has several grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation issues that significantly affect readability. While some parts are well-written, the numerous errors make the text difficult to read in places. I would rate it a 2.5.
For Coherence: The text lacks a clear structure and logical progression. The abrupt transitions and confusing narrative flow make it difficult to follow the overall message. I would rate it a 2.
