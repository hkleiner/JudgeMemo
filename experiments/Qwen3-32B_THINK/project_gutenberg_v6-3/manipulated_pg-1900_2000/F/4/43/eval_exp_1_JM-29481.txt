Alright, let me go through this text and assess its fluency and coherence according to the given criteria.

**FLUENCY Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] "prepared you the to accept must and of be man But work his violinist," limitations the said philosophical. This sentence is grammatically incorrect and incoherent.
2. [GRAMMAR] "the of invention I there at the the of player cease composer I and, skill but marvel the." This sentence is completely ungrammatical and incoherent.
3. [SYNTAX] "He they to arm offered drawing their made her room the together and way-his." This sentence has incorrect syntax and is difficult to understand.
4. [SPELLING] "concord" is used instead of "concord" (though it might be correct in context, it's a bit confusing).
5. [SPELLING] "tschaikowsky" is misspelled (should be "Tchaikovsky").
6. [SPELLING] "Niobe" is misspelled (should be "Niobē" or "Niobē" depending on the intended spelling).
7. [SPELLING] "Epicurus' soul" - the possessive might be better as "Epicurus's soul".
8. [PUNCTUATION] Missing periods and commas in several places, especially in the dialogue and in the philosophical discussions.
9. [PUNCTUATION] Incorrect use of hyphens in "way-his" and "cream-colored hammers".
10. [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the sentence: "And the soul will then awake," he added earnestly. "But is there such a one?" she asked.

**COHERENCE Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The text jumps from the dinner conversation to the concert without clear transition.
2. [LOGIC] The philosophical discussion about happiness and the painting of the crucified mother feels disconnected from the main narrative.
3. [LOGIC] The conversation between Diotti and Miss Wallace becomes increasingly abstract and philosophical, making it hard to follow the emotional connection between the characters.
4. [LOGIC] The shift from the dinner party to the concert is abrupt and lacks clear connection.
5. [LOGIC] The ending of Chapter II, where Diotti is dejected after his successful concert, is somewhat confusing as it doesn't clearly explain why he's so disappointed despite the success.
6. [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces ideas that are never resolved or fully explained.
7. [LOGIC] The transition from the dinner party to the concert in Chapter II is not clearly established.
8. [LOGIC] The philosophical discussions about art and music sometimes feel forced and disconnected from the characters' personal development.
9. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces complex ideas that are not fully developed or explained.
10. [LOGIC] The final chapter begins with Perkins' perspective, which is a shift in focus that could be confusing if not properly connected to the previous chapter.

Now, let me determine the scores:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors, syntax issues, and spelling mistakes. Some sentences are completely ungrammatical and incoherent, which would significantly impact readability. However, much of the text is still understandable. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the scale - it contains frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make comprehension difficult at times, but some segments are clear.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has noticeable abrupt shifts and some confusing segments. The philosophical discussions sometimes feel disconnected from the main narrative, and there are some logical inconsistencies in the story flow. However, the basic narrative structure is still somewhat clear. I would rate this as a 3 on the scale - it's generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.

Let me review my assessment once more to ensure I've captured the most serious issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] "prepared you the to accept must and of be man But work his violinist," limitations the said philosophical.
2. [GRAMMAR] "the of invention I there at the the of player cease composer I and, skill but marvel the."
3. [SYNTAX] "He they to arm offered drawing their made her room the together and way-his."
4. [SPELLING] "tschaikowsky" instead of "Tchaikovsky"
5. [SPELLING] "Niobe" (though this might be intentional)
6. [PUNCTUATION] Missing periods and commas in several places
7. [PUNCTUATION] Incorrect use of hyphens
8. [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in dialogue

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] Jumps from dinner conversation to concert without transition
2. [LOGIC] Philosophical discussions feel disconnected from narrative
3. [LOGIC] Abrupt shift in Chapter II from dinner party to concert
4. [LOGIC] Ending of Chapter II is confusing despite Diotti's success
5. [LOGIC] Ideas introduced but not resolved
6. [LOGIC] Shift in focus to Perkins in Chapter III

I believe these are the most significant issues that would impact the fluency and coherence scores. My final scores remain 2.5 for fluency and 3 for coherence.
