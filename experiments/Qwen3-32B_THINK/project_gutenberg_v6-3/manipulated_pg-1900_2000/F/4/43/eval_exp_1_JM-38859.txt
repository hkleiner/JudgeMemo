Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:

1) [PUNCTUATION] - The text has inconsistent punctuation, especially with missing periods and commas. For example, "Enlisted in Capt. John Allen's company June 7th, 1862. Went on board the steamer..." could be a run-on sentence without the period.

2) [PUNCTUATION] - The text has excessive periods and incomplete sentences. For example, "On the march from left to right, I ran across a Rebel who was shot through the bowels." followed by another sentence that seems to be a run-on.

3) [PUNCTUATION] - There are inconsistent quotation marks usage, with some quotes not properly closed.

4) [PUNCTUATION] - The text contains some unexplained parentheses and brackets that don't follow standard punctuation rules.

5) [SPELLING] - There are spelling errors like "Johnnies" which should be "Johnny's" in some contexts, and "Johnnies" when referring to Confederate soldiers.

6) [SPELLING] - The word "Yanks'" appears with an unnecessary apostrophe.

7) [SPELLING] - The phrase "the war exchange were to Col who. months, brigade few with from for ably commanded time, that Mitchell the glad close of Gilbert, to Gen. the a the exception" is incoherent and appears to be a spelling or grammatical error.

8) [GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles ("the" or "a") and incorrect verb forms.

9) [GRAMMAR] - The sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect, such as "I have mentioned this circumstance to show the feeling among soldiers when one is put out of action."

10) [SYNTAX] - The text has some confusing syntax, such as "I took a time place where we the to of my we on the came and which into monument in end marks on charge of, top went go ridge the ridge down the halted west the up were and ridge with the command."

11) [SYNTAX] - The text contains run-on sentences and sentences that are missing key components, making them difficult to understand.

12) [LEXICON] - There are some unclear or inappropriate word choices, such as "the war exchange were to Col who. months, brigade few with from for ably commanded time, that Mitchell the glad close of Gilbert, to Gen. the a the exception."

13) [PUNCTUATION] - There are some awkward or incorrect uses of parentheses, such as "(yet, can but My briars feel those I.)"

14) [PUNCTUATION] - The text has some missing or misplaced punctuation marks that make sentences difficult to parse.

15) [PUNCTUATION] - The text has some inconsistent capitalization of names and places.

## Coherence Issues:

1) [STRUCTURE] - The text jumps between different events and timelines without clear transitions.

2) [STRUCTURE] - There are some abrupt shifts in perspective and narrative flow.

3) [LOGIC] - Some sentences don't logically follow from the previous ones.

4) [LOGIC] - The text sometimes introduces new information without proper context.

5) [TRANSITION] - The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt or missing.

6) [LOGIC] - The text sometimes presents events out of chronological order or with unclear cause-and-effect relationships.

7) [STRUCTURE] - The narrative sometimes becomes disjointed, especially in the middle section.

8) [LOGIC] - Some parts of the text are confusing or contradictory, such as the incoherent sentence about "the war exchange were to Col who..."

9) [LOGIC] - The final paragraph is particularly confusing with the sentence "I took a time place where we the to of my we on the came and which into monument in end marks on charge of, top went go ridge the ridge down the halted west the up were and ridge with the command."

10) [LOGIC] - Some events are described without clear connections to the overall narrative.

Based on these issues, I'll now assign scores:

For Fluency: The text has numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors that affect readability. While some parts are clear, the frequent errors make comprehension challenging in many places. I would rate this a 2.5.

For Coherence: The text has some logical progression and follows a chronological narrative of war experiences, but there are many confusing shifts, unclear connections, and some disjointed sections that make the overall narrative difficult to follow. I would rate this a 3.
