Let me carefully analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. There are several grammatical errors in the text.
2. Some sentences have awkward phrasing or word order.
3. There are some punctuation issues.

Let me look for specific examples:

In the first chapter, I see:
- "In corner I dwellings, plot been vacant a a high found at of" - This appears to be a grammatical error where the sentence is not properly formed.
- "surrounded where ground a demolished walls squalid-insanitary had by strewn brick street" - This sentence is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand.
- "There which was a looking scene worth at was within" - This sentence has incorrect word order and is confusing.
- "The the attentions shabby, camp were they, altogether foreign neighbours but-brought that and into glory of out from, men a was police, protected which had their inhospitable serjeant by the unaccustomed women in yard an were oriental the and." - This is a very long, run-on sentence with multiple grammatical issues.

In the second chapter:
- "The as hammers magnificent if of Gypsies, craft endings was wielded the in, were they sensitively nerve heads-and the there their." - This sentence is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. The text describes a specific event with Gypsies in Liverpool, but some parts are confusing in how they connect.
2. There are some abrupt shifts in perspective or scene.
3. The narrative occasionally lacks clear transitions between ideas.

Looking at specific examples:
- The text starts with the author seeking out Gypsies at the slaughterhouse, but the transition to describing the Gypsies inside is somewhat abrupt.
- The text moves from describing the Gypsies at the slaughterhouse to their departure and then to their arrival in Birkenhead without clear transitional phrases.
- There are some confusing references to characters and events that could have been more clearly connected.

Now I'll evaluate the fluency and coherence according to the provided scales.

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but it's generally readable. The major issues are in a few specific sentences that significantly impact readability. The rest of the text is well-written and flows naturally. Given these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5 - the text is generally readable but has noticeable grammatical issues that interrupt the flow in some places.

**Coherence Score:**
The text follows a clear narrative about the Gypsies in Liverpool and their interactions with the local community. While there are a few places where the transitions could be smoother, the overall narrative is logically sequenced and the ideas connect well. There are a few confusing references, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding of the text. I would rate the coherence as a 4.0 - the text is mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts that don't significantly disrupt the flow or understanding.
