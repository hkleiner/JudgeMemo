Alright, let's take a look at the text to evaluate its fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] "The many boons conferred by Mr. John Palmer upon his generation faded before the advance of the railways; but he has deserved well of posterity, if only for that he altered the coach team from three horses to four." This sentence is quite long and has a complex structure that could be simplified for clarity.
- [SYNTAX] "He could fetch the last ounce out of a wheel-horse by the use of his double thong or his "apprentice," and the point of his lash told terribly upon his leaders." This sentence has a complex structure and could be clearer.
- [SPELLING] "The outside dying all less one ten passengers from hurt, or were coachman and more, her injuries had both himself the legs broken." This sentence has multiple errors in word order and is difficult to understand.
- [SYNTAX] "The drag, overturned have who 'can them,' the has with its not the servants, replace to window at they on, 'out their signs be writer coach the strength himself, the provided Sufferer it to been first proprietors A, the begs but passengers accomplished to coach when direct wheels coach with.'" This sentence is almost entirely incoherent and lacks proper syntax.
- [GRAMMAR] "The passengers, four in number, breakfasted and dined on the road, so it must have run at the rate of 12 miles an hour all the time it was travelling." The use of "it" to refer to the coach is clear, but the sentence could be more concise.
- [SYNTAX] "Thousands considerable event and to of a bets from parts people, all to witness assembled were amount the depending." This sentence has a jumbled structure and is difficult to parse.
- [GRAMMAR] "He was very frequently a faithful servant to his employers; considered trustworthy by bankers and others in the country through which he passed; and as humane to his horses, perhaps, as the adverse circumstances he was placed in by his masters would admit." This sentence has a complex structure that could be simplified for clarity.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from one topic to another with minimal transition, such as from the history of coach teams to accidents and then to races between coaches.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat haphazard, with some paragraphs focusing on the coachmen's skills, others on accidents, and others on racing, with little clear progression.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are difficult to follow due to complex sentences and lack of clear transitions, such as the section on the coachman who drove drunk and caused an accident.
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs, making it sometimes difficult to follow the flow of ideas.
- [LOGIC] The text presents a mix of historical information and anecdotes without a clear thread connecting them, making it challenging to grasp the overall narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure, with some paragraphs focusing on the coachmen's skills, others on accidents, and others on racing, with little clear progression.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph on the 1808 race is difficult to follow due to the jumbled structure of the sentence.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations.

For **Fluency**, the text has several grammatical and syntactic issues, with a few sentences that are difficult to understand. However, most of the text is readable and the main ideas are clear. I would rate it a 3.5 because while there are some issues that affect the flow and clarity, the text is generally understandable.

For **Coherence**, the text has some logical jumps and lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs. The structure is somewhat haphazard, with a mix of topics that are not always clearly connected. However, the main narrative about coachmen and their challenges is discernible. I would rate it a 3 because the text is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions.
