I'll evaluate the text according to the criteria of fluency and coherence on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, I need to analyze the text for issues with fluency (grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation) and coherence (logical progression, connected ideas, smooth transitions, and narrative structure).

Let's analyze the text:

Fluency Issues:
1. [GRAMMAR] "It an of first man battalions the society epoch the hold, time sending soldiers the carefully of to carry to, sent women knowledge, conquering within people instead in to for because marked benefits the world, of developed of conquered and selected highly in men the history of subjection a a body the of them a." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
2. [GRAMMAR] "Even from the a especial objects being shaving purpose treated ship cold a a petty water razor faces, or their often brush as had are sport of broom a been in bar a the iron lathered with old have tub of and passengers while a made the prominence the of of served of to not free of bath the officers." - This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
3. [GRAMMAR] "And it life well did if was 's, that, early city credence not the give weone its, to so is for history of he undisturbed quiet." - This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
4. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
5. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
6. [SYNTAX] "The first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from the city by horse." - The syntax is awkward and confusing.
7. [SYNTAX] "As at him in one, emerald the verdant reaches distance the below spreads a precipice by a plain, dizzying out depth bounded before there an sea." - This sentence is incoherent and has poor syntax.
8. [SYNTAX] "The wind which always blows in tropical countries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a mountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that it is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on the globe." - The syntax is awkward and confusing.
9. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
10. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
11. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
12. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
13. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
14. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
15. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
16. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
17. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
18. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
19. [SPELLING] "Kanakas" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.
20. [SPELLING] "Pasig" - This appears to be a misspelling or incorrect use of a word.

Coherence Issues:
1. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the precipice and the wind in Hawaii is confusing and lacks logical progression.
2. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology jumps abruptly from one topic to another without clear connections.
3. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the International Date Line and the "Revels of Neptune" is disjointed and lacks logical flow.
4. [LOGIC] The paragraph about Napoleon and the sailors is disconnected from the surrounding text and appears to be an inserted excerpt without clear context.
5. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the history of Manila is confusing and lacks a clear narrative structure.
6. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the stone bridge in Manila has a logical progression but some sentences are disconnected from the main narrative.
7. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the notice posted for teachers is abrupt and lacks context.
8. [LOGIC] The overall structure of the text jumps between different locations (San Francisco, Honolulu, Manila) without clear transitions.
9. [LOGIC] The text frequently shifts between descriptive passages and narrative elements without clear connections.
10. [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin with one topic and then shift to another without explanation or transition.

Based on my assessment:

For Fluency:
The text has significant issues with grammar, syntax, and coherence in several key paragraphs. There are multiple sentences that are completely incoherent or grammatically incorrect. However, there are also many parts of the text that are well-written and readable. I would rate the fluency as 2.5 - the text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure, though some segments are clear.

For Coherence:
The text has noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience. The narrative jumps between locations and topics without clear connections. While there is some logical progression in parts, the overall coherence is affected by these issues. I would rate the coherence as 2.5 - the text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing that makes it difficult to follow without extra effort.

Now, I'll format my response according to the requested format:
