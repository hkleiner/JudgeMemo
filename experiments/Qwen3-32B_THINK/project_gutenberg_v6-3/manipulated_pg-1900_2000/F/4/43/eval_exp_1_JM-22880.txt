Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:

1) [GRAMMAR] - "The etymology of the name Romsey has been much disputed. There can be no doubt about the meaning of the termination 'ey'--island--which we meet with under different spellings in many place-names..." - The sentence structure is awkward with the dash between "island" and "which".

2) [GRAMMAR] - "Another would Celtic this is be 'Marshy' (be); that against may island would apt 'word name,' be this make Ruimne the the mean and the derivation in the olden an marshy word again there would; can times be description doubt this that of place no alleged hybrid." - This is a completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect sentence.

3) [GRAMMAR] - "Yet another derivation which avoids this objection is the Old English 'RÃ»m' from whence we get 'room' and if we adopt this derivation Romsey, or Rumsey as it is still sometimes written and more often pronounced, would mean the roomy or 'Spacious Island.'" - This sentence is missing a comma after "room" which should be "and, if we adopt this derivation..."

4) [GRAMMAR] - "There assumed evidence to is have it is date fix, no to the documentary exact but been generally 907." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.

5) [GRAMMAR] - "This the may two leading seen, which arches entered was of be out still by ambulatory." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.

6) [GRAMMAR] - "It has been said that little Perpendicular work is to be seen in Romsey Abbey." - This is a complete sentence but ends the text abruptly without any transition.

7) [PUNCTUATION] - The text has inconsistent use of punctuation, especially with the use of dashes and quotation marks.

8) [SYNTAX] - The text has some awkward phrasing that makes the reading experience less smooth.

## Coherence Issues:

1) [LOGIC] - The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions. For example, it moves from the etymology of Romsey to Roman history to the foundation of the abbey without clear connections.

2) [STRUCTURE] - The structure of the text is somewhat haphazard, with some paragraphs focusing on the etymology, others on historical events, and others on architectural details, without a clear overall organization.

3) [TRANSITION] - There are several places where the text shifts topics abruptly without transitional phrases.

4) [INCONSISTENCY] - The text has some inconsistencies in how it presents information. For example, it states "There can be no doubt about the meaning of the termination 'ey'--island--which we meet with under different spellings..." but then presents multiple derivations for the name Romsey.

5) [INCOHERENCE] - The text has several incoherent or confusing sentences that make it difficult to follow the narrative (e.g., the second sentence after "Another would Celtic this is be 'Marshy' (be)...").

6) [INFORMATION FLOW] - The information flows in a somewhat disjointed manner, with details about the architecture of the abbey being presented out of chronological order.

Let me now assign scores based on these observations.

For Fluency:
The text contains several grammatical errors and incoherent sentences that significantly impact readability. The issues range from minor to severe, with some sentences being completely incoherent. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text is partially readable but has significant issues that make reading difficult in places.

For Coherence:
The text has logical jumps, inconsistent structure, and lacks smooth transitions between ideas. The narrative is somewhat disjointed, though the overall topic (Romsey Abbey) is clear. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text has some coherence but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.
