Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The user mentioned that I should look for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious errors. The first chapter seems well-written with proper grammar and structure. However, in the second chapter, "The the from Dynasty yoke B.C. Asiatic had of XVIIIth as belong the known, the two about the Pharaohs Amarna land the invaders freed which 1560 certain el Period of Tell to Shasu." That's a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order and missing articles. That's a major fluency issue.

Looking further, there's a sentence: "His inclined, just the., steps, in, was father to his walk Amenophis as of IV warlike however his little as son ancestors." This is a run-on sentence with incorrect syntax and punctuation. It's hard to parse and doesn't make sense. Another example is "The new capital received the significant name of 'Akhet-Aten' ('Horizon of the Sun') and was solemnly consecrated long before it was half finished." The structure here is okay, but the previous examples are worse.

I also notice some awkward phrasing like "The terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors," which is a bit archaic but not necessarily incorrect. However, there are instances where words are used incorrectly, like "preciosity" instead of "preciosity" (though that might be correct in context). 

Now, for coherence. The text is about historical events and the discovery of tablets. The first chapter is coherent, detailing the discovery and context. The second chapter starts with a jumbled sentence, which disrupts the flow. The transition from the first to the second chapter is smooth, but the second chapter's opening paragraph is incoherent due to the grammatical errors, making it hard to follow the narrative. 

There are also some abrupt shifts in the second chapter. For example, after discussing Amenophis III's reign, the text jumps to Amenophis IV's religious reforms without a clear transition. Additionally, some parts mention names and titles without proper context, which could confuse the reader if they're not familiar with the subject. 

The structure of the text is generally logical, but the errors in the second chapter significantly impact the overall coherence. The narrative is mostly clear, but the problematic sections make it difficult to follow the progression of events. 

Considering the fluency scale, the text has multiple grammatical and structural issues in the second chapter that interrupt the flow. While the first chapter is fluent, the second chapter's problems would lower the overall score. I'd rate fluency a 3 because there are multiple issues that affect readability. 

For coherence, the main problem is the incoherent opening of the second chapter and some abrupt shifts. The rest of the text is coherent, but the significant issues in the second chapter would lower the score. I'd give a 3 for coherence as well because the narrative is generally logical but has noticeable disruptions.
