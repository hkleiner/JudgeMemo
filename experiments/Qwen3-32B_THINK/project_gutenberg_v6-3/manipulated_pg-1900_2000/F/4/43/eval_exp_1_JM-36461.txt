Let me analyze the text to identify fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues:

I notice several problems with grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing in the text:

1) [GRAMMAR] - The text has numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb conjugations and subject-verb agreement issues.
2) [SYNTAX] - There are complex sentence structures that are difficult to parse and understand.
3) [SPELLING] - There are several misspelled words like "Hosier" (correct), "Dyer" (correct), and "Kauli-Kan" (unusual name, but not misspelled).
4) [LEXICON] - The text uses archaic or unusual word choices that may be difficult for modern readers to understand.
5) [PUNCTUATION] - There are issues with punctuation, including missing or incorrect punctuation marks.
6) [PHRASING] - Some phrases are awkwardly constructed or don't flow naturally.
7) [GRAMMAR] - There are issues with articles (a/an/the) and prepositions.
8) [SPELLING] - Some words are spelled inconsistently (e.g., "Heroism" vs "Heroinism").
9) [GRAMMAR] - There are issues with case usage (e.g., "this Deponent" vs "this deponent").

# Coherence Issues:

Looking at how the text flows as a whole:

1) [LOGIC] - The narrative has some logical gaps or inconsistencies in the chronology of events.
2) [STRUCTURE] - The text has an unusual structure with the oath at the beginning and then a narrative that sometimes circles back to the beginning.
3) [CLARITY] - Some sections are unclear or confusing in their meaning.
4) [TRANSITION] - The transitions between sections are sometimes abrupt or unclear.
5) [LOGIC] - There are some logical inconsistencies in the narrative.
6) [STRUCTURE] - The text jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.
7) [CLARITY] - Some sentences are overly complex and hard to follow.
8) [COHESION] - There are instances where the narrative loses cohesion or focus.

Now, I need to assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency:
The text has multiple grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity. Based on the scale, this would likely fall in the Score 3 range.

For Coherence:
The text has noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments that affect the reading experience. This also seems to align with the Score 3 range.

Let me review the text one more time to confirm my assessment:

The text is a historical account of Hannah Snell, who disguised herself as a man to serve in the military. It opens with an oath, then tells the story of her life and adventures. The text is written in an archaic style, which contributes to some of the fluency issues. There are many complex sentence structures, some of which are difficult to parse. The narrative has some logical jumps and inconsistencies, particularly in the middle section where the text becomes disjointed.

Based on my analysis, I'll assign the scores as follows:

Fluency Score: 3 (Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.)

Coherence Score: 3 (Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.)
