Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I notice some run-on sentences, like the one that starts with "He when to would my manner me I the an as provide..." which is clearly a syntax error. There are also some missing words, like "He when to would my manner me I the an as provide that I obtain necessary through friendliest was but he that go the obtained, letters that the in front must permission to I with me told permission American embassy." This part is incoherent and doesn't make sense. Spelling errors include "intensive" instead of "intensive" (maybe it's intentional as a noun?), but more likely a typo. Also, "immatriculation" is correct, but "immatriculation" is a less common term that might be confusing. The phrase "I it regretted I unique did not obliged experience, my accompany me this reflected former that trip I on would that matter, could companion alone although was much not go; the but charming to suffice." is a jumbled mess, showing poor syntax and word order. 

Next, coherence. The text is a narrative about the author's attempts to enter a war zone. The structure is generally chronological, but there are some abrupt shifts in focus. For example, after discussing the battlefield at Meaux, the narrative jumps to the Ministry of War again, which might be a bit jarring. There are also some unclear transitions, like the part where the author is told she can go to Rouen and Meaux but then objects to them. The logic is a bit confusing here. The author mentions the "battle of the Somme" but doesn't clearly explain its relevance. The overall narrative flows, but there are moments where the connections between ideas aren't smooth. 

For the fluency score, the text has several significant issues that disrupt reading, like the jumbled sentence and missing words. However, the rest of the text is mostly fluent with only minor errors. So maybe a 3.5? But some parts are really hard to parse. Maybe a 3? The coherence is better; the narrative has a clear progression, but the abrupt shifts and unclear transitions might lower it to a 4. The main issues are in fluency, so I'll go with Fluency: 3 and Coherence: 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Incoherent sentence structure in "He when to would my manner me I the an as provide..."  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled phrase: "I it regretted I unique did not obliged experience, my accompany me this reflected former that trip I on would that matter..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles/prepositions in "the battle of the Somme began" (should be "the Battle of the Somme began").  
- [SPELLING] "intensive" (likely intended as "intensive," but used as a noun).  
- [WORD CHOICE] Overuse of archaic phrasing (e.g., "you can come and go almost as freely as before the war").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between the author’s attempts to enter the war zone and descriptive details of battlefields.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the author’s refusal to visit Rouen and the subsequent approval to visit Châlons-sur-Marne.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from the Mayor’s account of Barcy to the Ministry of War granting new permissions.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the battle of the Somme" without context for its relevance.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
