Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. First, I'll go through the fluency issues. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, so it's quite lengthy. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues.

Looking at the first chapter, "An Introduction," I notice some sentences are a bit long and complex, but that's common in literary works. However, there are some grammatical errors. For example, in the sentence "So before or since he liberties; arts has smashed more enormously anyone done successfully took fronts--our--enriched more than and and he false," there's a run-on sentence with missing words and incorrect punctuation. The phrase "he liberties" doesn't make sense here. Also, there's a missing comma after "our" and the sentence structure is confusing. This is a [GRAMMAR] and [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example is "Your your for mother house keeps cousins." This seems to be a typo with "your" repeated and the sentence structure is jumbled. That's a [SPELLING] and [SYNTAX] problem.

In the second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," the sentence "Mr. where and leisurely rods there Newett fishing in several a guns walks to are corner." This is a complete jumble of words, possibly a typo or a misplaced sentence. Definitely a [GRAMMAR] and [SYNTAX] issue.

Now, for coherence. The text is a biography, so the flow should be logical. The first chapter discusses Bradley's impact on art, which is coherent. However, the second chapter jumps into his childhood. The transition between the two chapters is abrupt. The first chapter is a general overview, and the second dives into a detailed childhood narrative without a smooth transition. That's a [TRANSITION] issue.

Also, in the second chapter, there are some inconsistencies. The narrative starts with a scene in 1875, then moves through different events, but some parts are disjointed. For example, the mention of "Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch" follows a prayer for a printing press, which is a shift in the narrative flow. This could be a [LOGIC] issue.

Additionally, some sentences are unclear or ambiguous. For instance, "Having of beside to a are window can the as to lay noon-learn the the lower--going you half their where schoolchildren case wave an proudly they hour you home leisure of meal." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't convey a clear meaning. That's a [CLARITY] problem.

There's also a part where the text mentions "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window. It is nearly nine o’clock on a Friday night--‘make-up’ time. Mr. Newett has written his last sheets of copy and is reading proof. At the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap." The connection between the editor's actions and the faker selling soap isn't clear. This is another [LOGIC] issue.

Considering the scale for coherence, the text has some abrupt transitions and unclear segments, but it's mostly coherent as a biography. However, the issues mentioned affect the overall flow. For fluency, the text has several grammatical and syntactical errors that disrupt reading. The scale for fluency would be lower due to these issues. 

So, for fluency, I'd rate it a 2.5 because there are frequent errors that make parts difficult to understand. For coherence, maybe a 3.5 since it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues in transitions and clarity.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] [Run-on sentence and missing words in "So before or since he liberties; arts has smashed more enormously anyone done successfully took fronts--our--enriched more than and and he false"]  
- [SYNTAX] [Jumbled sentence structure in "Your your for mother house keeps cousins"]  
- [GRAMMAR] [Incoherent sentence in "Mr. where and leisurely rods there Newett fishing in several a guns walks to are corner"]  
- [SPELLING] [Typo in "Your your for mother house keeps cousins"]  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] [Abrupt shift from the introduction to the detailed childhood narrative without logical connection]  
- [LOGIC] [Inconsistent narrative flow in the childhood chapter, e.g., sudden shift from prayer for a printing press to receiving a watch]  
- [CLARITY] [Ambiguous and disjointed sentence in "Having of beside to a are window can the as to lay noon-learn the the lower--going you half their where schoolchildren case wave an proudly they hour you home leisure of meal"]  
- [LOGIC] [Unclear connection between editor’s actions and the scene with the soap faker in the childhood chapter]  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
