Alright, I'll evaluate the given text based on the requested criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, I'll analyze for fluency issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "One July morning, over a hundred years ago there stood in a forlorn room of a log house in Plymouth, a tall, severe looking woman in rich apparel, and a ragged desperate child of fourteen." - The sentence structure is awkward with multiple noun phrases strung together.
- [GRAMMAR] "On the floor in a drunken stupor, lay a man." - Awkward sentence structure with inverted subject-verb order.
- [GRAMMAR] "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence, and she was bound out to Mrs. Lane like a slave; she, proud, free Debby Mason!" - Run-on sentence with multiple clauses connected by semicolons and commas.
- [GRAMMAR] "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes." - Awkward phrase "stood before" when "stood before" is more natural.
- [GRAMMAR] "Debby grew white to the lips." - This is a common phrase but feels slightly awkward in the context.
- [GRAMMAR] "It mattered little to Debby whether her father was Whig or Tory, no matter what he was she hungered for him day and night." - Awkward repetition of "no matter what he was".
- [GRAMMAR] "During the year which dragged drearily away after Mr. Mason left the town, Debby learned to do some useful things in her new home, and she grew straight and tall and strong; but her heart was hard and bitter." - Run-on sentence with multiple clauses connected by semicolons.
- [GRAMMAR] "Strange as it seemed though, in all her misery in the prim existence, she remembered her mother clearer than ever before, and snatches of old talk and scenes came sharply to her mind." - Awkward phrase "Strange as it seemed though" and awkward sentence structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "Things grew confused as Debby tried to think, but there was one night that was ever clear." - Awkward phrase "Things grew confused as Debby tried to think".
- [GRAMMAR] "And so it had gone from bad to worse until the town had ordered Bill Mason from the village of his adoption, and had bound Debby to Mrs. Lane for five years." - Awkward phrase "had gone from bad to worse" and "had bound Debby to Mrs. Lane".
- [GRAMMAR] "“I don’t care.” Debby had suffered so much in various forms during her short life, that the subject had ceased to interest her." - Awkward phrase "had suffered so much in various forms".
- [GRAMMAR] "She never trembled as did the well cared for little Puritans, over Elder Morris’ prayers." - Awkward phrase "as did the well cared for little Puritans".
- [GRAMMAR] "“Jack was my only friend when all the other boys and girls turned on me, ’tis not like I’d forget Jack.” There was a dangerous flash in Debby’s eyes." - Awkward transition between dialogue and description.
- [GRAMMAR] "“Now go to thy room, Deborah, for the love of thy soul have I chastised thee. After evening prayers to-night I will come to thy room. If thou art repentant, I will overlook thy insolence, but mark my words, dost thou repeat the offence, girl, I will lay the rod across thy shoulders, until I have conquered thy spirit." - Awkward and overly complex sentence structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "Silently she shuffled to her room on the second floor far to the back of the house. Closing sank window to she began down door and in real the the think near earnest." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a jumble of words.
- [GRAMMAR] "The day wore wearily away." - Awkward phrase "wore wearily away".
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" - This appears to be an error in the text, as it's not part of the story.

Now for coherence issues:

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods without clear transitions (e.g., from Debby's childhood to her time with Mrs. Lane).
- [LOGIC] The story sometimes presents events in a non-linear or confusing order.
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions are vague or unclear (e.g., "that somewhere of silence and absence").
- [TRANSITION] Some scene transitions are abrupt or lack smooth connections (e.g., from Debby's confrontation with Mrs. Lane to her being sent to her room).
- [CHARACTERIZATION] Some character motivations and actions are not clearly explained (e.g., why Debby suddenly becomes rebellious).
- [PLOT] Some plot points are not clearly connected or explained (e.g., Debby's connection to the Revolutionary War).
- [CONTRADICTION] There are some contradictions in the narrative (e.g., Debby is described as both rebellious and meek).
- [PACING] The pacing is uneven, with some sections moving quickly and others dragging.
- [FOCUS] The story sometimes shifts focus between different themes and characters without clear direction.
- [CONTEXT] Some historical and cultural references are unclear (e.g., the specific nature of the conflict in Plymouth).
- [TONE] The tone shifts abruptly between serious and humorous without clear transitions.
- [NARRATIVE ARC] The overall narrative arc is not clearly defined or resolved.

Based on these observations, I'll now assign scores for fluency and coherence:

For fluency, the text has numerous grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and some incoherent sentences. While the language is generally readable, the frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing do impact the flow and readability. I would give it a score of 2.5 - it contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

For coherence, the text has several issues with structure, logic, and transitions. The narrative sometimes jumps between time periods without clear transitions, some plot points are not clearly connected, and the overall narrative arc is not clearly defined. However, the story is generally understandable and follows a basic narrative progression. I would give it a score of 3 - generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
