Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. 

First, **Fluency** looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice several issues. For example, in the first chapter, the sentence "I definite was a the college with world a was into unprepared ready, diploma go to out for but position." This is a run-on sentence with incorrect word order and missing punctuation, making it hard to parse. There are also some spelling errors like "definite" instead of "definitely" or "unprepared." 

Another part is "We the through use looked been some rooms grade of which for had in years." This seems like a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order. There are also instances of missing articles or prepositions, such as "the study hall. We found the janitor busily engaged in arranging the seats. He said he didn't know just which way the desks should face, as no one had told him..." The transition here is abrupt. 

Looking at coherence, the **Coherence** metric assesses the logical flow and structure. The text starts with the author's transition into teaching, then shifts to two different stories about young men in teaching. The first story is about a man who is the board president and discusses the school's poor state, while the second is a more positive example of a teacher who improves the environment. The transition between these two examples is somewhat abrupt, but they both serve to illustrate different approaches to teaching. 

However, in the second chapter, the narrative shifts to discussing how to get a teaching position, which is a logical progression from the first chapter. The structure here is more linear. There are a few instances where the flow is disrupted, such as the part where the author talks about a young man seeking a promotion and a young woman's experience, which might feel a bit disconnected but serve to contrast motivations in teaching.

For fluency, the main issues are grammatical errors, run-on sentences, and awkward phrasing. The coherence is generally good with a clear progression from entering the profession to getting a position, but there are some abrupt shifts between examples. 

Assigning scores: For **Fluency**, the text has multiple grammatical and structural issues that affect readability, so maybe a 2.5. For **Coherence**, despite some shifts, the overall structure is logical, so a 3.5.
