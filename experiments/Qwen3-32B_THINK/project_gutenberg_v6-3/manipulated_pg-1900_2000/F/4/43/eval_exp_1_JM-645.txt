Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues

I'll go through the text and identify any problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [GRAMMAR] "I could only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for kindness." - This sentence has a grammatical issue with the placement of "however" and missing conjunction.

2. [SYNTAX] "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn't satisfied how could Vereker himself be?" - This sentence has awkward syntax that makes it difficult to understand the relationship between the clauses.

3. [SPELLING] "Corvick humouredly from a at all events me wrote little Paris-ill." - This appears to be a spelling error or garbled text.

4. [SYNTAX] "I give judged I but, much did, quite expected I pleasure had perhaps as not her so." - This sentence is completely garbled and incoherent.

5. [GRAMMAR] "All the point n’t wait was helped Iis over—" - This sentence is incomplete and has multiple grammatical errors.

6. [SYNTAX] "his we and dish pretend he shoulder to does a at, himself author passed this that had see But while." - This sentence is completely garbled and incoherent.

7. [SPELLING] "Miss cloth thrust across the her Poyle half chin." - This appears to be a spelling error or garbled text.

8. [GRAMMAR] "I had had on my tongue’s end, for my own part, a phrase or two about the right word at the right time;" - The phrase "I had had" is awkward and unnecessary.

9. [SPELLING] "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." - The contraction "He’d" is correct, but the phrase is awkward.

10. [SYNTAX] "He did this half an hour later—I saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room." - The punctuation and structure of this sentence is awkward.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2.5. The text has frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure that make it difficult to read and understand in places.

## Coherence Issues

I'll now look at how the text flows as a whole and identify any issues with logical sequencing, transitions, or overall structure.

1. [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a chapter from a novel, but the structure is confusing in places. There are long, complex sentences that make it difficult to follow the narrative flow.

2. [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time points and perspectives without clear transitions. For example, the text moves from Corvick's situation to the narrator's experience at Bridges without clear connections.

3. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of the story.

4. [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or ambiguous, particularly towards the end of the text where the sentences become garbled and incoherent.

5. [PLOT] The plot elements are not always clearly connected. For instance, the relationship between the narrator's article and Vereker's reaction is not clearly established.

6. [CHARACTER] The characters' motivations and relationships are not always clearly explained. For example, the dynamic between Corvick and Gwendolen Erme is introduced but not fully developed.

7. [NARRATIVE] The narrative voice is consistent, but the complexity of the sentences and the multiple layers of meaning make it difficult to follow the story.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 2. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make the overall coherence difficult to follow without extra effort, especially in the latter part where the text becomes increasingly incoherent.
