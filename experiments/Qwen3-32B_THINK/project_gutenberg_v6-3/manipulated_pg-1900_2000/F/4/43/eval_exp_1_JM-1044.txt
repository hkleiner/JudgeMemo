Alright, let's dive into evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency and coherence issues. The text is an excerpt from "Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven," so it's a narrative with some complex descriptions. 

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The first thing I notice is the use of "warn’t" which is an archaic contraction for "wasn't." That's probably intentional for style, but it might be a red flag for some readers. Then there's "Of but instance one comets came you a that when—a sortcourse like flashEncke Halley, ’s across—it and warn’t anything just see I for vanish and, ’s of." This sentence is a mess. The words are jumbled, making it hard to parse. There are missing words, incorrect word order, and unclear phrases. For example, "Of but instance one comets came you a that when..." doesn't make sense. Also, "sortcourse" is likely a typo for "sort of course," and "flashEncke Halley" might be a name but is written incorrectly. 

Another part: "By of fifty by little could to yet of even upwards I by had his coast up and for shape, got had I I the a hundred then a his n’t miles andwaistband see that along him sailed million and." This is a run-on sentence with no punctuation, making it incoherent. Words are out of order, and there's a lack of clarity. "My could, hangingthe their our there noblest seen I’ve friend that without out tails _even_ over down comets inside lay comets orbits n’t of." Again, this is a jumbled sentence with incorrect syntax and missing words.

Looking at coherence. The story is about a captain traveling through space, encountering comets, and arriving at heaven. The flow of the narrative should be logical. However, some parts are confusing. For instance, the part where the captain interacts with the head clerk and the under clerk. The dialogue is supposed to highlight the difference in understanding between the celestial beings and the captain. But the dialogue is disjointed. The captain says, "Columbus I heard; of him reckon it’ve you anyway _likely_, discovered." The syntax is incorrect, making it hard to understand the message. Also, the transition from the comet race to arriving at heaven is abrupt. The text mentions "As was an the, that for race at end." which is a non-sequitur and doesn't connect the previous events to the conclusion.

There are also some inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, the captain talks about meeting comets and racing them, which is a coherent part, but then the sudden shift to the bureaucratic confusion at the gates of heaven doesn't flow smoothly. The reader is left wondering how the captain got from space travel to the celestial bureaucracy without a clear transition.

Putting it all together, for fluency, the text has multiple grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and jumbled sentences that disrupt readability. For coherence, the story has logical jumps, unclear transitions, and some parts that don't connect well. The final scores would reflect these issues, with fluency being lower due to the many errors and coherence being mid to low because of the structural problems.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "Of but instance one comets came you a that when—a sortcourse like flashEncke Halley, ’s across—it and warn’t anything just see I for vanish and, ’s of." (Incoherent syntax, missing words, and fragmented phrasing).  
- [SPELLING] "sortcourse" (likely intended as "sort of course"), "flashEncke" (misspelled proper noun).  
- [SYNTAX] "By of fifty by little could to yet of even upwards I by had his coast up and for shape, got had I I the a hundred then a his n’t miles andwaistband see that along him sailed million and." (Run-on sentence with nonsensical structure).  
- [GRAMMAR] "My could, hangingthe their our there noblest seen I’ve friend that without out tails _even_ over down comets inside lay comets orbits n’t of." (Fragmented and grammatically incorrect).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from comet race to bureaucratic confusion at heaven’s gates without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative in "As was an the, that for race at end." (Non-sequitur).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing dialogue: "Columbus I heard; of him reckon it’ve you anyway _likely_, discovered." (Unclear syntax disrupts understanding).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from space travel to celestial bureaucracy without contextual linkage.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
