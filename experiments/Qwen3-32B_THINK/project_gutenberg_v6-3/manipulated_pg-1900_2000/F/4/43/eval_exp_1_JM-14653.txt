Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the entire text carefully to get a sense of what's going on.

The text is a chapter from a book discussing the changing nature of Christmas over time, contrasting the past with the present. It's written in a reflective, somewhat nostalgic tone, using elaborate language and complex sentence structures. The author contrasts the genuine enthusiasm of past Christmases with the current sense of obligation and loss of magic, attributing this to the influence of scientific skepticism and the loss of faith.

Now, moving to the fluency evaluation. Fluency checks for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Let me look for any issues here. 

First, I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, in the line "And we and larked sang could we, until no danced and more." This seems to be a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order. The words "larked sang could we" don't form a coherent phrase, and the sentence ends abruptly with "until no danced and more." This is a syntax problem.

Another example is "It is written for persons who can look facts cheerfully in the face." The phrase "look facts cheerfully in the face" is a bit awkward. Maybe "face facts cheerfully" would be more natural, but the current phrasing is still understandable, just a bit clunky. This could be a word choice or phrasing issue.

There's also a part that says, "Hence the very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to them, it was in the past to their elders." The sentence structure here is a bit convoluted. The use of "hence" followed by the explanation is okay, but the sentence could be clearer with a comma or rephrasing. This might be a syntax or clarity issue.

Looking further, in the second chapter, there's a sentence that starts with "They tremendous and, that and can science nature feat is by exercise presence mankind, the hostile an of mutual discoveries succeed the and of, still which that with forget mankind philosophy has in sincerity power of in faith shattering after to of of goodwill all and amid that this only conclusions live in dignity based and the unknowable charity." This is a complete messâ€”words are jumbled without clear meaning. This is a severe syntax and structure problem, making the sentence unintelligible.

Another example: "Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are at a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism, and self-expression in general." The phrase "at a discount" is used metaphorically here, which is okay, but the sentence could be clearer. However, it's not a major fluency issue since the meaning is still graspable.

Now, checking for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text starts by contrasting past and present Christmas, then moves to discuss the role of children, and then shifts to the reasons behind the loss of Christmas spirit, blaming scientific skepticism. The argument is somewhat logical but there are some issues.

In the first chapter, the author transitions from the past to the present, then to the role of children in maintaining tradition. The transition is okay, but the shift from discussing the past to the role of children is a bit abrupt. The connection between children's belief and the author's own disillusionment isn't clearly explained. This could be a logic or transition issue.

In the second chapter, the author introduces the idea that the decline in Christmas spirit is due to scientific skepticism. However, the transition from discussing children's faith to scientific skepticism is not smooth. The author mentions philosophers and scientists like Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, and Huxley, but the connection between their work and the loss of Christmas spirit is not clearly made. There's a logical jump here, which could be a logic or clarity issue.

Additionally, the second chapter has some very dense and convoluted sentences that make it hard to follow the argument. For example, the sentence about the "age of doubt and scepticism" and the subsequent paragraphs are filled with complex, run-on sentences that don't clearly connect their ideas. This affects the overall coherence.

There's also a part where the author says, "An age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain persons have pretended the contrary." Then the next paragraph starts with "It full faith in, problems never greatest, to a necessary a satisfactory in existence can which, spite up the, science warning it faith of universe of it including gives philosophers that admits faith some Spencer of sort Herbert is despises its of solve." This is completely incoherent and doesn't contribute to the argument. This is a major coherence issue due to poor structure and unclear ideas.

Another coherence issue is the sudden shift in the second chapter from discussing the impact of scientific skepticism to talking about the "great principles, spiritual and moral" remaining intact. The connection between these ideas isn't clearly established, making the transition abrupt and confusing.

Overall, the text has some fluency issues, particularly in the second chapter where certain sentences are jumbled and difficult to parse. The coherence is affected by abrupt transitions, unclear connections between ideas, and some sections that are entirely incoherent, especially in the latter part of the second chapter. The author's argument is somewhat logical but marred by these structural and clarity issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "And we and larked sang could we, until no danced and more." (Jumbled word order and incomplete phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Hence the very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to them, it was in the past to their elders." (Awkward structure and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "They tremendous and, that and can science nature feat is by exercise presence mankind, the hostile an of mutual discoveries succeed the and of, still which that with forget mankind philosophy has in sincerity power of in faith shattering after to of of goodwill all and amid that this only conclusions live in dignity based and the unknowable charity." (Incoherent, jumbled sentence with no clear meaning)  
- [LEXICON] "Faith is at a discount." (Metaphorical phrasing is unconventional and slightly awkward)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing children's role to scientific skepticism without clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] Convolution in the second chapter (e.g., "It full faith in, problems never greatest...") renders arguments incoherent.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt jump from the impact of scientific skepticism to the "great principles" remaining intact without explanatory link.  
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected ideas in the final paragraph about "the unknowable charity" and "conclusions live in dignity" lack logical progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2
