Let me carefully evaluate the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll read through the text to get a general sense of its content and structure. This appears to be a formal statement about Bahá'u'lláh, a religious figure, covering his life, mission, and the Bahá'í Faith. The text is well-structured into chapters and has a formal, informative tone.

Now, I'll assess fluency issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Bahá’u’lláh’s writings been many have religious widely proselytism aggressive the which through messages forbid promulgated."
- [GRAMMAR] "For to decades, has languages people ’s several writings translation everywhere eight hundred program fromselections accessible systematic in publication and, of a made Bahá’u’lláh over."
- [GRAMMAR] "The claim ended represented from contrary Revelation the that any, the evoked the Muḥammad of assertion Muslim violent and to had who; apostasy taught with clergy had death Divine process by, hostility that punishable."

These sentences are clearly grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand. The words appear to be in the wrong order and the sentence structures are non-standard.

Now, coherence issues:

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions, particularly in the section about the Báb and the early 19th century messianic movements.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is somewhat disjointed, with some paragraphs beginning with new ideas without proper context.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are not clearly connected to the main theme of Bahá'u'lláh and his mission.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are not always smooth or logical, making the flow of ideas sometimes abrupt.

I'll now assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For fluency, I notice several major grammatical issues that significantly impact readability. However, the rest of the text is generally well-written and fluent. The major issues are concentrated in specific sentences rather than throughout the entire text. Based on the scale, this would likely be a score of 3 or 3.5.

For coherence, the text has a clear overall structure with chapters and a logical progression in most sections. However, there are some abrupt transitions and some paragraphs that could be better connected to the main theme. The text is generally coherent but has noticeable issues. Based on the scale, this would likely be a score of 3.5 or 4.

Let me finalize my scores and issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Bahá’u’lláh’s writings been many have religious widely proselytism aggressive the which through messages forbid promulgated."
- [GRAMMAR] "For to decades, has languages people ’s several writings translation everywhere eight hundred program fromselections accessible systematic in publication and, of a made Bahá’u’lláh over."
- [GRAMMAR] "The claim ended represented from contrary Revelation the that any, the evoked the Muḥammad of assertion Muslim violent and to had who; apostasy taught with clergy had death Divine process by, hostility that punishable."

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions, particularly in the section about the Báb and the early 19th century messianic movements.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is somewhat disjointed, with some paragraphs beginning with new ideas without proper context.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are not clearly connected to the main theme of Bahá'u'lláh and his mission.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are not always smooth or logical, making the flow of ideas sometimes abrupt.

Final Fluency Score: 3.5 (The text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.)

Final Coherence Score: 3.5 (The text is generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.)

Actually, let me reconsider my scores. The fluency issues I identified are quite severe and would significantly impact readability. They appear to be concentrated in specific sections rather than throughout the entire text, but they are quite disruptive when they occur. This might warrant a lower score than 3.5. 

The coherence issues are also noticeable but not as severe as the fluency issues. The text has a clear overall structure and logical progression in most sections, despite some abrupt transitions and disconnected ideas.

Final Fluency Score: 3 (The text contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.)

Final Coherence Score: 3.5 (The text is generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.)

Wait, let me check one more time. The fluency issues I identified are quite severe and would significantly impact readability. They appear to be concentrated in specific sections rather than throughout the entire text, but they are quite disruptive when they occur. This might warrant a lower score than 3.5. 

The coherence issues are also noticeable but not as severe as the fluency issues. The text has a clear overall structure and logical progression in most sections, despite some abrupt transitions and disconnected ideas.

Final Fluency Score: 3 (The text contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.)

Final Coherence Score: 3.5 (The text is generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.)
