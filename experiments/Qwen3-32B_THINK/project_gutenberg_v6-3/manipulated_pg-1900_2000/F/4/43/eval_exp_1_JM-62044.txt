Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "The my—of in of for of little of to the the men as enjoyment of but—is beings my and intelligence we evidence, lordship fellow assume not written as serves existence by stimulating the have or history preserve the the faithful qualities, simple memory the deals whom a creature with facts help-merely to over interest fellow moral was lives unsuspected-it to record the the, in it, humble the." This sentence is incoherent and appears to be a grammatical mess.

2. [GRAMMAR] "My in he if he that protection and had speedy sure his and result to—a escape would increased eagerness with a, his Hans, in life protection certain had found, of me life a was, have the he chance as result whole of the, advantage, on showed his a, shortened gone to as death probably it." This is another grammatically incorrect and incoherent sentence.

3. [SYNTAX] "The squirrel, if taken young, can be made to enjoy his domestication so completely that he makes no attempt to escape, and may be trusted in the open, with due precaution from cats." The syntax is awkward and the sentence structure is confusing.

4. [SPELLING] "I am told that the squirrel destroys the forest, and I know that in some forests relentless war is waged against him—war with guns, which is at least semi-merciful, but also with traps, that crush and torture this, the most delicate and sensitive creature that runs on four legs, leaving him mangled, and perhaps for hours tearing his tender limbs in an exquisite torture which even a tiger should be spared." The word "semi-merciful" is an unusual and awkward term choice.

5. [SYNTAX] "I have gone through the Black Forest, looking in vain for the truncated trees, and in the pine-forests, in England, where I have been able to investigate, I have never seen the work of the squirrels’ teeth." This sentence is long and awkwardly constructed.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text starts with a philosophical discussion about animal intelligence and domestication, then moves to a personal anecdote about squirrels, then shifts to a discussion about animal rights and ethics. The transitions between these different topics are abrupt and the overall structure lacks logical flow.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas without clear organization. It begins with a general discussion of animal intelligence, moves to a specific discussion of squirrels, then shifts to a broader discussion of animal rights and ethics, and ends with a specific example from a gamekeeper.

3. [CLARITY] The text often lacks clear connections between ideas. For example, it discusses the author's experiences with squirrels, but then shifts to a general discussion about animal rights without clear transitions.

4. [TRANSITION] There are many abrupt transitions between ideas. For example, the text moves from discussing the author's experiences with squirrels to a philosophical discussion about humanity and sympathy without a clear transition.

5. [LOGIC] The text contains some contradictory statements. For example, it states that the author has "never kept one in close confinement" but then discusses how squirrels can be "made to enjoy his domestication so completely that he makes no attempt to escape."

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a somewhat logical structure with a general flow from philosophical discussion to personal experience to broader ethical considerations, but the transitions between these sections are often abrupt and the connections between ideas are not always clear. There are some inconsistencies in the arguments presented. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues with logical flow and transitions.

**Fluency Score:**
The text has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but overall it's mostly readable. The most serious issues are the two completely incoherent sentences in the middle of the text. These significantly impact readability. I would rate this as a 3 - it's generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.

Let me double-check my assessment:

**Coherence:**
- The text has a general structure that follows a logical progression from philosophical discussion to personal experience to broader ethical considerations.
- However, the transitions between these sections are often abrupt.
- There are some inconsistencies in the arguments presented.
- The text could have been more clearly organized.
- The score of 3.5 seems appropriate as it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues.

**Fluency:**
- The text is mostly readable with clear, natural phrasing.
- There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.
- The two completely incoherent sentences significantly impact readability.
- The score of 3 seems appropriate as it's generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.

My final assessment:

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent sentence: "The my—of in of for of little of to the the men as enjoyment of but—is beings my and intelligence we evidence, lordship fellow assume not written as serves existence by stimulating the have or history preserve the the faithful qualities, simple memory the deals whom a creature with facts help-merely to over interest fellow moral was lives unsuspected-it to record the the, in it, humble the."
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent sentence: "My in he if he that protection and had speedy sure his and result to—a escape would increased eagerness with a, his Hans, in life protection certain had found, of me life a was, have the he chance as result whole of the, advantage, on showed his a, shortened gone to as death probably it."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure: "The squirrel, if taken young, can be made to enjoy his domestication so completely that he makes no attempt to escape, and may be trusted in the open, with due precaution from cats."
- [SPELLING] Unusual term choice: "semi-merciful"
- [SYNTAX] Awkwardly constructed long sentence: "I have gone through the Black Forest, looking in vain for the truncated trees, and in the pine-forests, in England, where I have been able to investigate, I have never seen the work of the squirrels’ teeth."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between philosophical discussion, personal anecdote, and ethical considerations.
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure with unclear organization.
- [CLARITY] Lack of clear connections between ideas.
- [TRANSITION] Many abrupt transitions between ideas.
- [LOGIC] Some contradictory statements about the author's position on animal captivity.
