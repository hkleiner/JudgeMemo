Alright, let's take a look at the text. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence. First, I need to identify any issues in each category.

Starting with fluency. The text is a story, so I should check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. I notice some parts where the punctuation is off, like the line "claims n't deprived might But one if the he dismal, petno I?" that who, Don grown at be him new him keep of I his had ca pleaded can thought." This seems like a sentence fragment or a typo. Also, there are some awkward phrasings, like "sheep collies herds about that we Uncle, the care will and like Alan of take was the us telling." That's a bit confusing and might be a syntax issue. There are also some missing commas or incorrect punctuation that disrupt the flow.

For coherence, the story should have a logical flow and smooth transitions. The narrative starts with a preface about Scotch cousins, then moves to the story of Donald finding a puppy. The transition between the preface and the main story is a bit abrupt. There are some parts where the narrative jumps without clear transitions, like when the story shifts to discussing tea and Scottish food, then back to the puppy. Also, some sentences are a bit disjointed, like the part where the doctor's advice is interrupted by a jumbled sentence. The ending has a line that's not properly structured: "The Roy the family favourite father story author Rob of, Don decided him a who Walter Sir finally written the evenings name over great the to which, 'after whole,' was talked reading was aloud but, Scott to time, matter his then even Scotch him long it by his hero." This is confusing and breaks the flow.

Now, scoring. For fluency, there are a few issues that are noticeable but not too severe. The text is mostly readable, but the jumbled sentences and punctuation issues affect the flow. I'd say a 3.5. For coherence, the story is generally coherent, but the abrupt transitions and some disjointed parts lower the score. I'd rate it a 3.5 as well.
