Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues

I'll look for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1) [GRAMMAR] The sentence "It that needs to conditions adapting been have up evoked the time who active, methods recognize which are call hitherto are, if to capitalists unknown by and which as hitherto they is that themselves for incapable of unemployed." is grammatically incoherent and impossible to understand. It appears to be a jumbled mix of words that doesn't form a coherent sentence.

2) [GRAMMAR] The sentence "I from or capitalism the incontrovertible advances to found here credit established individual in Italy of fact be essential Venice the an the speculation studies enumerate republics on--to of, on enterprise features, commercial will, city, that century the etc.--are even in seem have not, me twelfth manner to all which--profits, the, Genoa Florence." is also grammatically incoherent and unreadable.

3) [GRAMMAR] The sentence "It to had this, that it up that, succeeded by capitalism is incontestable rôle the period in on which played force diminishing from legal time." is grammatically incorrect and confusing.

4) [SYNTAX] There are several run-on sentences and sentences with poor syntax structure that make reading difficult.

5) [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation, particularly in the sentence with the dashes: "Bücher's brilliant Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft--to say nothing here of the thesis since formulated with such extreme radicalism by W. Sombart--that the economic organisation of the Middle Ages has no aspect to which one can rightly apply the term capitalistic," which is grammatically correct but could be clearer.

6) [LEXICON] There are some awkward word choices and phrasings that make the text less fluent.

## Coherence Issues

I'll look for problems with logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression from one section to another, and consistent structure.

1) [LOGIC] The text contains several incoherent passages that disrupt the logical flow, particularly the two jumbled sentences about capitalism in Italy and the one about the role of capitalism.

2) [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex academic structure that might be challenging for some readers, but it's generally coherent in its argumentation despite the problematic passages.

3) [CLARITY] The overall argument is clear - the author is discussing the evolution of capitalism through different historical periods - but the incoherent passages significantly disrupt the clarity.

4) [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are generally smooth, though the text's complexity sometimes makes the flow harder to follow.

Now I'll assign scores based on these observations:

For Fluency:
The text is mostly well-written academic prose with clear, natural phrasing. However, the presence of two completely incoherent sentences and one other problematic sentence significantly impacts the fluency. These issues would distract readers and make parts of the text difficult to understand. The rest of the text is quite fluent. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5 - generally readable but with multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.

For Coherence:
The text presents a clear argument about the evolution of capitalism through different historical periods. The structure is logical and the ideas generally follow a clear progression. However, the presence of incoherent passages significantly disrupts the coherence. Despite these issues, the overall argument is still understandable. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5 - generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me double check my assessment:

Fluency: The text is mostly fluent academic writing, but has several problematic passages that make parts of it difficult to understand. This aligns with a score of 3 - generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.

Coherence: The text has a clear argument and structure, but the incoherent passages disrupt the overall coherence. This aligns with a score of 3 - generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.

I think these assessments are appropriate.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent sentence: "It that needs to conditions adapting been have up evoked the time who active..."
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent sentence: "I from or capitalism the incontrovertible advances to found here credit..."
- [GRAMMAR] Incoherent sentence: "It to had this, that it up that, succeeded by capitalism is incontestable rôle..."
- [SYNTAX] Multiple run-on sentences and poor syntax structure
- [PUNCTUATION] Issues with punctuation in complex sentences
- [LEXICON] Awkward word choices and phrasings

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Incoherent passages disrupt logical flow
- [CLARITY] Overall argument is clear but incoherent segments reduce clarity
- [STRUCTURE] Complex academic structure is generally coherent despite problematic passages
- [TRANSITION] Transitions are generally smooth but text complexity sometimes hinders flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
