**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "The not break separation did off their intercourse." - This sentence has incorrect word order and grammar.
2. [GRAMMAR] "If an least was, this fortune not a assured at living." - This sentence is grammatically incorrect.
3. [GRAMMAR] "Being boyish own doubt she her retained the destined without, of up to" - This sentence has incorrect word order and grammar.
4. [GRAMMAR] "and with mark to owes which manners, that age she characterize boys, virile slightest young which, those life acquired her that she brought was throughout painting." - This sentence is grammatically incorrect with confusing word order.
5. [GRAMMAR] "The the works" - Repeated article.
6. [GRAMMAR] "and of a the, be copying young halls girl Louvre energy the in FIRST determined with this seen great, desperate the long of might SUCCESSES Not" - This sentence is grammatically incorrect with confusing word order.
7. [SPELLING] "SUCCESSES" - This word is capitalized unnecessarily.
8. [GRAMMAR] "Rosa her Bonheur found path had." - This sentence is incomplete and grammatically incorrect.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The chapter heading "CHAPTER: THE the works" is confusing and has repeated articles.
2. [LOGIC] The text jumps from the Bonheur family's early life to Rosa's later development with little transitional material.
3. [LOGIC] The text describes Rosa's childhood and development in a somewhat disjointed manner, with some events mentioned out of chronological order.
4. [LOGIC] There are some abrupt shifts in narrative focus, such as from the family's financial struggles to Rosa's artistic development.
5. [CLARITY] Some sentences are difficult to follow due to their complex structure and word order.
6. [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces new information without sufficient context or explanation.

Now, I'll score the text for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency Score:**
The text contains multiple grammatical errors that disrupt the reading flow. The most serious issues include the grammatically incorrect sentences and the confusing word order in several places. However, there are still many fluent sections that are clear and well-structured. Based on the scale, I would rate this as a 2.5. The text has frequent grammatical errors that make comprehension difficult at times, but there are still some clear segments.

**Coherence Score:**
The text tells a story about Rosa Bonheur's life and development as an artist, but it has some issues with logical progression and transitions. The narrative has some abrupt shifts and lacks sufficient transitional material between some sections. However, the overall story is still somewhat coherent and follows a general chronological progression. Based on the scale, I would rate this as a 3. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.

So my final assessment would be:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The not break separation did off their intercourse." - [GRAMMAR] "If an least was, this fortune not a assured at living." - [GRAMMAR] "Being boyish own doubt she her retained the destined without, of up to" - [GRAMMAR] "and with mark to owes which manners, that age she characterize boys, virile slightest young which, those life acquired her that she brought was throughout painting." - [GRAMMAR] "The the works" - [GRAMMAR] "and of a the, be copying young halls girl Louvre energy the in FIRST determined with this seen great, desperate the long of might SUCCESSES Not" - [SPELLING] "SUCCESSES" - [GRAMMAR] "Rosa her Bonheur found path had."
