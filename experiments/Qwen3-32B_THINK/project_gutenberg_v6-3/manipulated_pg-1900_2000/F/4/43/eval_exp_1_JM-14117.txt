Alright, let me go through this step by step. First, I need to evaluate the text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. 

Starting with fluency. The text is a bit old-fashioned, but I'll focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I notice some sentences are run-on or have awkward phrasing. For example, "For application be what a if not the science of is to profession it life?" That doesn't make sense. There are also missing articles and incorrect word order. "If pick insist her to only properly out were their she employees being upon work really to of would not, better able the but be housewife worthy name done." That's a jumbled sentence. Also, some parts have incorrect punctuation or missing commas. There are a few spelling errors like "coöperation" which is correct, but others might be issues. So fluency has several problems but isn't completely unreadable.

Now for coherence. The text is structured into chapters and parts, so the overall structure is there. However, some sections jump abruptly. The first chapter talks about the housewife's ignorance, the next about difficulty in finding help, then comparing housework to other jobs. The flow between these sections could be smoother. Some paragraphs start with a new idea without transition. The conclusion parts are a bit unclear, especially the last chapter where the argument about housework's disadvantages compared to other work isn't as clearly connected. Also, some sentences are confusing and don't clearly support the main points. There's a mix of strong arguments and weaker transitions. 

For fluency issues, I'll list the main problems. Grammar and syntax errors, awkward phrasing, jumbled sentences, missing articles, incorrect word order, and some spelling issues. For coherence, the main issues are abrupt transitions between sections, unclear connections between ideas, some confusing sentences, and weaker argument flow in later chapters. 

Assigning scores: Fluency has multiple issues but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because the errors are noticeable but don't make it hard to understand. Coherence is a 4 because the structure is there but some transitions and clarity issues affect the flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SPELLING] Non-standard spelling like "coöperation" (though technically correct in some dialects) could be distracting
- [STRUCTURE] Run-on sentences and missing punctuation in "The telephone is a very convenient instrument... but it must be remembered..."

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from discussing housewife ignorance to difficulty finding help without transitional connection
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear progression between chapters about causes, employee difficulty, and work comparison
- [CLARITY] Confusing final paragraph in first chapter with incoherent phrasing about housewife responsibility
- [TRANSITION] Weak transition between discussion of telephone ordering and merchant exploitation
- [COHERENCE] Last chapter's argument about housework disadvantages lacks clear connection to previous sections

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
