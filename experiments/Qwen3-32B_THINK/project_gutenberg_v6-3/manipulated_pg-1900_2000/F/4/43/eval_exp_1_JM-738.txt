Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

Fluency Issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "Some world in they, of since character that outline have many may outline no or "absolutely essential if, outline, humour an so atmosphere essential, elaborate best a Really have," construction are the novels think "it." is not is critics, "demned," the." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.

2. [GRAMMAR] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." - The sentence structure is awkward and confusing.

3. [GRAMMAR] "We philanthropist think best Miss Twinkleton ’s mannerisms may, that Mr., the the in the, not of, are humour schoolmistress of andof the author vein Honeythunder." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.

4. [GRAMMAR] "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the "atmosphere" of a small cathedral town." - The sentence structure is awkward and the placement of "I think" disrupts the flow.

5. [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, "_that_, I never saw "_that_ before." - The punctuation and quotation marks are confusing and disrupt the reading flow.

6. [GRAMMAR] "If she has been dealing in opium for ten years (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper’s birth." - The sentence structure is awkward and confusing.

7. [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." - The use of "is being watched" is awkward and less natural than "is being watched" would be.

8. [GRAMMAR] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" - The sentence structure is awkward and confusing.

9. [GRAMMAR] "This “furiously,” of learn, hearing his agony is love pain we whom so desires Jasper, of the Edwin speak lightly." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.

10. [GRAMMAR] "In the crypt "he habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor." - The quotation marks are used incorrectly.

Coherence Issues:

1. [LOGIC] The text begins with a completely incoherent paragraph that makes no sense and seems to be a random jumble of words.

2. [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from a coherent discussion about Dickens to a completely incoherent paragraph with no clear connection.

3. [LOGIC] The text later returns to a coherent discussion about Dickens and the novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood, but the earlier incoherent paragraph creates a jarring disruption.

4. [LOGIC] The text discusses the characters and plot of The Mystery of Edwin Drood in a generally coherent way, but the inclusion of the incoherent paragraph significantly reduces the overall coherence.

5. [LOGIC] Some parts of the text discuss literary criticism and analysis, while other parts seem to be direct excerpts from the novel itself, creating a confusing mix of genres.

6. [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with an introduction and a chapter on the story, but the incoherent paragraph disrupts this structure.

7. [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear progression in discussing Dickens's later novels, the author's health issues, and the specific novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood, but the incoherent paragraph disrupts this progression.

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency:
The text has many serious grammatical issues, including several completely incoherent paragraphs. These issues significantly disrupt the reading experience. I would rate it a 2 - the text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

For Coherence:
The text has a clear overall structure and logical progression in discussing Dickens and his novel, but it contains a completely incoherent paragraph that significantly disrupts the flow. I would rate it a 3 - generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.

Let me review my evaluation once more to ensure accuracy:

Fluency: The text has many serious grammatical issues, with at least one completely incoherent paragraph. It also has awkward sentence structures and confusing phrasing throughout. A score of 2 is appropriate.

Coherence: The text has a clear overall structure and logical progression in discussing Dickens and his novel, but it contains a completely incoherent paragraph that significantly disrupts the flow. This issue affects the reading experience, but the rest of the text is generally coherent. A score of 3 is appropriate.
