Alright, let me take a look at this task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the provided criteria and scales. The text is a historical narrative about Canterbury, covering its history, the Cathedral, and related sites. 

First, I'll start with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll need to scan through for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with punctuation and word choice. Let me check some sections. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons was sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., 'To thee, Thomas Becket, some time Archbishop of Canterbury'--who had then been dead for 368 years--'to appear within thirty days to answer to a charge of treason, contumacy, and rebellion against his sovereign lord, King Henry II.'" The punctuation here seems a bit off. The use of em dashes and the placement of the period after "Henry VIII." might be better as a comma. Also, "Henry II." is mentioned, but the original text refers to Henry VIII, so that's a possible error. 

Next, there are some run-on sentences. For example: "The earliest people who have left evidence of their existence near Canterbury belong to the Palæolithic Age; but as it is not known whether this remote prehistoric population occupied the actual site, or even whether the valley may not have then been a salt-water creek, it is wiser in this brief sketch to pass over these primitive people and the lake-dwellers who, after a considerable interval, were possibly their successors, and come to the surer ground of history." This sentence is very long and could be split for better readability.

I also notice some inconsistent capitalization in names like "Durovernum" and "Derwhern." Additionally, there's a mix of British and American spellings (e.g., "Palæolithic" vs. "Paleolithic"), which might be intentional but could affect fluency if inconsistent. 

Moving on to coherence. The text is structured into chapters, which is good, but I need to check if the flow between sections is logical. The narrative jumps from the 16th century back to Roman times and then to Saxon periods. While the structure is chronological, the transitions between these periods could be smoother. For instance, the shift from discussing the dissolution of monasteries to the Roman invasions might be jarring if not clearly signaled. 

There are also some abrupt shifts in focus. For example, the text moves from discussing the history of Canterbury to the murder of Becket and then to the cathedral's construction. The connections between these sections are there, but the transitions could be clearer. Additionally, some sections seem to repeat information, like the description of the cathedral's architecture in different chapters, which might cause redundancy.

I should also check for logical progression. The text starts with the 16th-century events, then goes back to Roman times, then to Saxon, and later to medieval and modern times. While this is chronological, the way it's presented might not always be clear. For example, the section on the murder of Becket is detailed but could be better integrated into the broader historical narrative of Canterbury.

Now, applying the scales. For fluency, the text has some grammatical issues, run-on sentences, and inconsistent capitalization. However, these don't severely impact readability. The overall structure is coherent, and the errors are relatively minor. So a score of 4 seems appropriate. 

For coherence, the text is generally logical but has some abrupt transitions and occasional redundancy. The chapters are well-organized, but the flow between different historical periods could be smoother. The score here might be 3.5, as there are noticeable issues with transitions and structure that affect the overall coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect reference to "Henry II" instead of "Henry VIII" in the first paragraph.  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with excessive length and complexity (e.g., the Palæolithic Age paragraph).  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Palæolithic" vs. "Roman" in adjacent sections).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of em dashes and commas in dialogue and narrative sections.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal phrasing ("cosmopolitan groups of travel-soiled men and women") that may disrupt modern readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chronological jumps (e.g., from 16th-century events to Roman history) with insufficient transitional phrases.  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of architectural descriptions across chapters (e.g., the cathedral’s construction phases).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between historical events and their broader implications (e.g., the murder of Becket’s role in Canterbury’s legacy).  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in focus (e.g., from medieval pilgrimages to modern tourism) without explanatory context.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Mixed narrative voice (e.g., direct quotes vs. expository analysis) that disrupts the flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
