Alright, let's evaluate the text according to the given criteria.

# Fluency Issues

I'll start by looking for any issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, or punctuation that might disrupt the flow of the text.

1. [SYNTAX] The text contains many long, complex sentences with multiple clauses that could be more clearly structured. For example, "You, together with hosts of your fellow-countrymen, believe this unfavourable opinion is the result of the truth being kept from the American public by improper means" is a very long sentence with multiple ideas.

2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward structure that could be simplified. For example, "It is not my desire, however, to dwell upon this phase of your correspondence" is a roundabout way to say "I don't want to focus on this aspect of your letter."

3. [WORD CHOICE] The text uses some archaic or formal language that may be less clear to modern readers, such as "duly received," "deluging alien soil in an heroic defence," and "the roll of American journalists."

4. [WORD CHOICE] Some phrases are overly formal or complex when simpler language could be used. For example, "I can assure you that my failure to reply more promptly was not meant as any discourtesy" could be simplified to "I want to assure you my delay in replying was not a sign of discourtesy."

5. [PUNCTUATION] The text uses some long dashes in a way that could be confusing. For example, "-PLAIN WORDS FROM AMERICA-" at the beginning is non-standard punctuation.

6. [SPELLING] There are a few spelling issues, though they are minimal. For example, "deluging" is used in a context that might be more clearly expressed as "covering" or "flooded with."

7. [GRAMMAR] The text generally maintains good grammar throughout, with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

Overall, the text is quite fluent, with only a few issues that might slightly disrupt the flow for some readers.

# Coherence Issues

Now, let's look at how well the text is organized and how logically the ideas connect.

1. [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, formal letter with a clear structure, but it's quite dense and could be divided into shorter sections for better readability.

2. [LOGIC] The overall argument is logical and follows a clear structure, but the text is extremely long and covers many different points that might be better organized into separate sections.

3. [LOGIC] The text jumps between multiple topics without clear transitions in some places. For example, it moves from discussing the German press to discussing censorship to discussing the author's personal experiences with Germans.

4. [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented in a way that could be more clearly connected. For example, the author discusses American opinions about Germany before the war, then about the sources of information during the war, and then about specific events like the Lusitania sinking, but the connections between these sections could be more clearly articulated.

5. [CLARITY] Some of the arguments are quite complex and could be more clearly explained. For example, the author's discussion of the German government's philosophy of the state versus the individual is a complex topic that could use more concrete examples or clearer explanations.

6. [LOGIC] The text presents a strong argument against the German government, but the author's personal biases are quite evident, which might make the text seem less objective to some readers.

7. [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the chapter divisions don't always correspond to clear thematic breaks, making it harder to follow the overall structure.

Overall, the text is coherent in its overall argument and structure, but it could be more clearly organized and transitions between ideas could be smoother.

# Final Scores

Fluency: The text is generally fluent with only minor issues. The complex sentence structures and formal language might be challenging for some readers, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall readability. I would rate the fluency as 4.5.

Coherence: The text has a clear overall structure and argument, but the length and density of the content make it challenging to follow in places. The transitions between ideas could be smoother, and the organization could be improved. I would rate the coherence as 4.
