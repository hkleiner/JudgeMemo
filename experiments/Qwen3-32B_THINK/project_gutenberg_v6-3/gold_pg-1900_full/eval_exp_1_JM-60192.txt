Alright, I'll evaluate the given text according to the instructions.

First, I'll read through the text carefully and identify any issues with fluency and coherence. I'll categorize these issues and then assign scores based on the evaluation criteria provided.

For fluency, I'm looking for:
- Grammar issues
- Spelling errors
- Syntax problems
- Word choice and phrasing issues
- Punctuation issues

For coherence, I'm looking for:
- Logical sequencing of ideas
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Clarity of progression
- Consistency in structure
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps

Let me go through the text systematically to identify issues:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "altho" is used instead of "although" multiple times
- [GRAMMAR] "brot" is used instead of "brought" multiple times
- [GRAMMAR] "thoro" is used instead of "thorough" multiple times
- [GRAMMAR] "thoroly" is used instead of "thoroughly" multiple times
- [GRAMMAR] "enuf" is used instead of "enough" multiple times
- [GRAMMAR] "guava" is misspelled as "guava" (not actually wrong, but inconsistent with other spellings)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some compound sentences
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing apostrophes in contractions like "it's" is sometimes missing
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em dashes and hyphens
- [SPELLING] "Sante Fe" should be "Santo Fe"
- [SPELLING] "diseases" is misspelled as "diseases" (not actually wrong, but inconsistent)
- [SPELLING] "diseases" is misspelled as "diseases" (not actually wrong, but inconsistent)
- [SPELLING] "diseases" is misspelled as "diseases" (not actually wrong, but inconsistent)

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized by chapters on different spices, but the flow between chapters is abrupt
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs jump from one topic to another without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some technical terms are introduced without explanation (e.g., "pericarp")
- [STRUCTURE] The text uses a very formal and academic style that may be difficult for some readers
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them hard to follow
- [LOGIC] The historical information is often presented in a disjointed manner
- [CLARITY] Some explanations are repetitive or redundant
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear section headings within chapters, making it difficult to navigate

Based on these observations:

For fluency, the text has several spelling and grammar issues that affect readability, though the overall content is understandable. I would rate this as a 3.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence, the text is well-structured in terms of its chapter organization, but the flow between topics within chapters is often abrupt. The formal style and complex sentences make it challenging for some readers. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.

Let me double-check my evaluation to ensure accuracy:

Fluency: The text contains multiple spelling and grammar issues that, while not making it unreadable, do affect the smooth reading experience. The use of archaic or incorrect spellings (like "altho" instead of "although") and inconsistent punctuation are notable issues. However, the content is generally clear and the text is readable, which supports a mid-range score.

Coherence: The text is organized by chapters on different spices, which provides a logical structure. However, the flow within chapters is often abrupt, with little transition between paragraphs. The formal academic style makes it challenging for some readers, and the complex sentences can be difficult to follow. The text lacks clear section headings within chapters, which would help with navigation.

Based on my evaluation:
- Fluency score: 3.5
- Coherence score: 3

I'll now format my response according to the requested format.
