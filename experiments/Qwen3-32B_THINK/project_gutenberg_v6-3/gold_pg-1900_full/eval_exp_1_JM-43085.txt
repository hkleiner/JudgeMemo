Let me analyze the text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Evaluation

I need to look for issues related to syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have awkward or incorrect grammar, like "One day--it was neither in war time nor during manoeuvres--on a July morning..." which has an unusual structure with double em dashes.
- [SPELLING] I don't see obvious spelling errors, though I'll check for any.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are quite long and complex, which could affect readability.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the context of an art biography.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some unusual punctuation marks, like em dashes used for parenthetical statements.

Overall, the text appears to be quite fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

## Coherence Evaluation

I need to assess how well the text flows as a whole, with logical sequencing, smooth transitions, and clear progression.

Looking through the text:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured with clear chapters (Introduction, Early Years, First Success, Etchings, Paintings, Military Paintings) that follow a chronological progression.
- [LOGIC] The information is presented in a logical sequence, following Meissonier's life from birth to his artistic career.
- [CLARITY] The text is generally clear in its explanations about Meissonier's life and work.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are smooth, with clear signposts like "Let us keep this attitude of mind before us..." or "We left them for a time..."

The text demonstrates a clear narrative flow with well-organized information.

## Final Assessment

Fluency: I would rate this text as a 4.5. It is mostly fluent with only minor issues in grammar and syntax that don't significantly impact readability. The text is well-written and professional.

Coherence: I would rate this text as a 5. It is highly coherent with a clear structure, logical progression, smooth transitions, and unified narrative throughout.

Let me double-check my assessment for accuracy:

Fluency: The text is professionally written with only minor issues that don't distract from the overall readability. I would rate it as 4.5 rather than a full 5 because of the few grammatical oddities and complex sentence structures.

Coherence: The text is well-structured with clear progression through Meissonier's life and career. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the information is presented in a logical sequence. I would rate it as a full 5 for coherence.
