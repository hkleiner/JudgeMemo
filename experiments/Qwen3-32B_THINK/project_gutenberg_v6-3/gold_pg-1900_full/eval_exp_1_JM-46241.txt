I'll analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

For fluency, I'll look for issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation that might disrupt the smooth reading of the text.

For coherence, I'll examine the logical flow of the text, the connection between ideas, and the overall structure to determine if the narrative is clear and well-organized.

Let me go through the text carefully to identify any issues:

### Fluency Issues:
1. [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent punctuation, with some sentences ending with periods and others with semicolons or dashes in an inconsistent way.
2. [WORD CHOICE] There are some archaic or uncommon word choices that might be confusing to modern readers (e.g., "wherewithal", "wherewith", "whence", "whereto").
3. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better readability.
4. [PUNCTUATION] There are instances of missing commas in complex sentences.
5. [SPELLING] There are some spelling inconsistencies, such as "Ulm" vs "Ulm" with inconsistent capitalization.
6. [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have awkward line breaks that disrupt the flow (e.g., "This big alphabet is very beautiful and seems to have been a good deal copied by other German printers, as it well deserved to be.").
7. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are run-on or have awkward phrasing that makes them harder to follow.

### Coherence Issues:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure and main points.
2. [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between different topics or time periods.
3. [LOGIC] Some paragraphs jump from one topic to another without clear connections.
4. [CLARITY] The text often discusses specific books and artists in detail without always making clear how they relate to the broader thesis.
5. [ORGANIZATION] The text could benefit from clearer sectioning or headings to help guide the reader through the content.
6. [PERSPECTIVE] The author's perspective and the overall argument could be more clearly defined and consistently maintained.
7. [FOCUS] Some sections go into great detail about specific books or artists without always connecting back to the main topic.
8. [PROGRESSION] The chronological progression of the content is sometimes unclear or jumpy.

Now, let me assign scores based on these observations:

### Fluency Score:
The text is generally well-written with good grammar and vocabulary, but the complex sentence structure, archaic language, and occasional punctuation issues make it somewhat challenging to read. I would rate it a 3.5.

### Coherence Score:
The text is dense and detailed, but the lack of clear organization, transitions, and focus makes it difficult to follow the overall argument. The author jumps between different topics and time periods without clear connections. I would rate it a 3.

Let me double-check my analysis to ensure I haven't missed anything:

The text is a scholarly article on early woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts. It's written in a formal, academic style with some archaic language. The content is dense with specific information about books, printers, and artists, which is well-researched but can be overwhelming for a general reader.

The fluency issues are mostly minor and don't significantly hinder understanding, but they do make the text less accessible. The coherence issues are more substantial, as the text can be difficult to follow at times due to its dense content and lack of clear organization.

I believe my scores of 3.5 for fluency and 3 for coherence are appropriate based on the evaluation criteria.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation marks and line breaks disrupting sentence flow
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures that make reading challenging
- [WORD CHOICE] Use of archaic or uncommon vocabulary (e.g., "wherewithal", "wherewith")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization of proper nouns
- [SYNTAX] Some run-on sentences and awkward phrasing

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Text is extremely dense and lacks clear organization
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between topics and time periods
- [LOGIC] Paragraphs often jump between subjects without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Specific book and artist details are not consistently connected to main thesis
- [ORGANIZATION] Needs clearer sectioning or headings to guide readers
- [PERSPECTIVE] Author's perspective and argument could be more clearly defined
- [FOCUS] Some sections go into excessive detail without connecting back to main topic
- [PROGRESSION] Chronological progression is sometimes unclear or jumpy

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
