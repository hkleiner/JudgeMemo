Alright, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the provided criteria and scales. The user wants bullet points for each issue under the respective categories, followed by scores.

First, I'll read through the text to get a sense of its content. It's a detailed historical account of Romsey Abbey, covering its history, architecture, and notable figures. The text is quite long and dense with information, which might affect both fluency and coherence.

For fluency, I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. Let me scan the text for any obvious errors. The text seems well-written overall, but there might be some minor issues. For example, I notice a few instances where commas are missing in lists, or where sentence structures are complex and might be slightly confusing. Also, there are some archaic spellings and terms that might be less familiar, but they don't necessarily affect fluency if used correctly.

For coherence, I need to check the logical flow, transitions between ideas, and overall structure. The text is divided into chapters and sections, which is good. However, some sections might jump abruptly from one topic to another without clear transitions. Also, there are multiple details and historical facts that might be presented without sufficient context, making it harder to follow the narrative.

Now, let me list the specific issues I found. For fluency, I noticed a few instances of missing commas, awkward phrasing in complex sentences, and some archaic terms that could be confusing. For coherence, the transitions between sections could be smoother, and some parts might benefit from more connecting sentences to maintain the flow.

After identifying these issues, I'll assign scores based on the provided scales. The fluency seems mostly fluent with minor issues, so maybe a 4. Coherence is generally good but has some areas where the flow could be improved, perhaps a 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some historical descriptions (e.g., "The first authentic mention of the abbey is found in the chronicle of Florence of Worcester, who died in 1118, and whose work, at least that part of it which deals with English history, is a Latin translation of the Old English Chronicle").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in lists (e.g., "The reader can form his own opinion as to which is the most probable of these three suggestions. The writer is inclined to favour the third").  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing in archaic or technical terms (e.g., "The stone of which the Abbey Church is built, was quarried at Binstead, in the Isle of Wight").  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent hyphenation (e.g., "roomy" vs. "roomy" in same paragraph).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between architectural details and historical anecdotes without clear transitions (e.g., jumping from 14th-century renovations to a legend about a grindstone corbel).  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of architectural descriptions across chapters without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between cause and effect in historical events (e.g., "the dissolution of the Abbey" mentioned without prior context).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from architectural details in Chapter II to biographical accounts in Chapter IV).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
