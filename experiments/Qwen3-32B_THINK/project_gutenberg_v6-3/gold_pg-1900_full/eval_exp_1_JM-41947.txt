I need to evaluate the given text according to the fluency and coherence metrics. Let me carefully read through the text first to understand its content and identify any issues.

This is a biographical text about Fran√ßois Boucher, a French painter. The text is written in a narrative style with chapter headings, and it chronologically covers different periods of Boucher's life.

Now, let me analyze the text for fluency issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow.
2. [SPELLING] There appears to be one potential spelling error: "phnix-wise" should be "phoenix-wise."
3. [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic or old-fashioned language that might be confusing to modern readers (e.g., "wheresoever", "dandified", "agog").
4. [PUNCTUATION] Some punctuation is inconsistent or missing in complex sentences.
5. [STYLE] The writing style is very formal and elaborate, with some wordiness that could be simplified for better readability.

Now, let me analyze the text for coherence issues:

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized chronologically, which helps with coherence, but the frequent shifts in perspective and topic within paragraphs can be disorienting.
2. [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, especially when moving from one historical event to another.
3. [CLARITY] The text often includes complex descriptions and historical context that could be more clearly connected to the main narrative about Boucher.
4. [FOCUS] While the text maintains a focus on Boucher's life and work, it sometimes veers into detailed historical context that may not be directly relevant to the main narrative.
5. [PACING] The text moves quickly through some periods of Boucher's life while lingering excessively on others, creating an uneven narrative pace.

Now, let me assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Coherence Score:** The text is generally coherent with a clear chronological structure and logical progression of Boucher's life. However, the frequent shifts in perspective, some unclear transitions, and occasional tangents on historical context affect the overall coherence. I would rate this as a 4.0.

**Fluency Score:** The text is generally fluent with clear writing, but the overly complex sentence structures, archaic language, and some punctuation issues create some obstacles to smooth reading. The text is still quite readable, but these issues prevent it from being at the highest level of fluency. I would rate this as a 4.0 as well.

Let me now structure this in the required format:

- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or missing punctuation in complex sentences
- [STYLE] Excessively formal and elaborate writing style with wordiness

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Frequent shifts in perspective and topic within paragraphs
- [LOGIC] Abrupt or unclear transitions between ideas and historical events
- [CLARITY] Complex descriptions and historical context not always clearly connected to main narrative
- [FOCUS] Some detailed historical context that may not be directly relevant to Boucher's story
