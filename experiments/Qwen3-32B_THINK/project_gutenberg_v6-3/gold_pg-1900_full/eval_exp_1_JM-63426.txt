I'll evaluate the given text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, I'll analyze fluency issues:

1. Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, such as "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."
- [SYNTAX] There are instances of overly complex sentence structures that make reading more difficult, like "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn't?--but when he hit his stride it wasn't Europe’s leadership he followed."
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have inconsistent or missing punctuation, such as the lack of a period after "he followed" in the sentence above.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are somewhat archaic or uncommon for modern readers, which might affect readability.

Now, for coherence issues:

2. Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
- [LOGIC] Some connections between ideas are not clearly made, particularly in the dense historical and typographical content.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and within long passages are sometimes abrupt or missing.
- [CLARITY] Some sections contain complex historical and typographical information that could be more clearly explained for a general reader.

Based on these observations:

3. FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
The text has a clear narrative about Will Bradley's life and career, but the structure could be improved with clearer transitions and organization. The content is dense with historical and typographical information that is sometimes presented without sufficient context or explanation for a general reader. The narrative flow is somewhat disrupted by the way information is presented in different chapters.

4. FINAL Fluency Score: 4
The text is generally fluent with clear, natural phrasing throughout most of the content. While there are some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing in a few places, these do not significantly disrupt the overall readability. The language is generally well-structured and flows smoothly, with only minor issues that don't distract from understanding the content.
