Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence.

For fluency, I'll look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text is a well-written story with a classical tone. I don't see any obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The sentences are well-structured, and the language flows smoothly. There are some complex sentences and archaic word choices (like "whispered," "reverential," "syllogism," etc.), but they don't seem to disrupt the flow. I don't notice any spelling errors. The punctuation is appropriate and the word choices are consistent with the narrative style. The only minor issue I see is the use of archaic or less common words that might be confusing to some readers, but this is a stylistic choice rather than a flaw in fluency.

For coherence, I'll assess how the story unfolds, the logical sequencing of events, the connection between ideas, and the overall structure. The story has a clear narrative arc: Diotti's arrival in America, his meeting with Mildred, his concert, his disappearance, his return, and the final tragic events. The progression of the plot is logical and the transitions between scenes are smooth. There are no abrupt shifts or confusing segments. The characters' motivations and the story's themes are consistent throughout. The narrative has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the events are connected in a way that makes sense. There is one minor issue with the introduction of the "fifth string" concept, which is somewhat complex and might require readers to pay close attention to understand the symbolism.

Based on these observations, I would rate the text as follows:

Fluency: The text is highly fluent with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any archaic language is a stylistic choice rather than a flaw. Score: 5

Coherence: The story has a clear and logical progression throughout with smooth transitions between ideas. There are no significant disruptions to the flow or understanding of the text. There is one minor issue with the complexity of the "fifth string" concept, but it doesn't significantly hinder the overall coherence. Score: 5

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Use of archaic/complex vocabulary (e.g., "syllogism," "terpsichorean," "reverential") that may confuse modern readers  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The "fifth string" concept is introduced late and its implications require careful reading to fully grasp  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 5
