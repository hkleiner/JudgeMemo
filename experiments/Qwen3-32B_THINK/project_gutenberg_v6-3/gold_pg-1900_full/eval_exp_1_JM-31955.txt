Alright, let's evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, for fluency issues:
- The text is a historical narrative with complex sentences and specialized vocabulary. I need to look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice and punctuation.
- I notice some instances of run-on sentences and occasional grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "The printed story of Niagara dates back only three centuries; and during the first three decades of even that period the references to this wonderful handiwork of Nature--which was located in a then unexplored region of a New World, a Continent then inhabited only by warring tribes of superstitious Savages--are few and far between." This is a very long sentence with multiple dashes and commas that could be confusing.
- There are some instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, such as missing periods or commas in places where they're needed.
- The use of em dashes and ellipses is sometimes excessive, making the text feel cluttered.
- Some word choices could be clearer or more concise, though the overall vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter.

Now for coherence issues:
- The text is structured into chapters, which is logical, but I need to check for logical flow between ideas and whether the narrative is well-organized.
- The narrative jumps between different topics (legends, historical facts, scientific explanations) without always providing clear transitions.
- There are some abrupt shifts in perspective and content, which could make the reading experience disjointed.
- Some paragraphs are quite long and dense, making it difficult to follow the main points.
- There are some instances of repetition or redundancy, which could be streamlined for better coherence.

Let me now assess the fluency first and give a score:
- The text is generally fluent and well-structured for the most part, but contains some minor issues with grammar and punctuation that could be distracting.
- The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject, but some sentences are overly complex and could be clearer.
- Overall, I would rate the fluency as a 4. There are some minor issues that could be improved, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall readability.

For coherence:
- The text is organized into chapters, which provides a logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions between topics.
- The narrative sometimes jumps between different aspects of Niagara without clear connections.
- The dense paragraphs and complex sentence structures make it sometimes challenging to follow the flow of ideas.
- Overall, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent, but there are noticeable issues with transitions and organization that affect the reading experience.

Now, let me identify the specific issues for each category:

Fluency Issues:
- [SYNTAX] Very long and complex sentences with multiple clauses and punctuation marks that can be confusing.
- [GRAMMAR] Some grammatical inconsistencies, such as subject-verb agreement issues in some sentences.
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes and ellipses, which can make the text feel cluttered.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be clearer or more concise, though the vocabulary is generally appropriate for the subject.

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (legends, historical facts, scientific explanations) without always providing clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs are dense and lack clear progression of ideas.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in perspective and content can make the reading experience disjointed.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without sufficient context or explanation.
