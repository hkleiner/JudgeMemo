Alright, let's go through this text and evaluate it for fluency and coherence.

First, fluency. Fluency is about how the text reads in terms of grammar, syntax, word choice, and overall smoothness. I need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with clarity.

Looking at the text, I notice a few instances where the verb tense or subject-verb agreement is off. For example, "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." should be "has revealed" since "research" is singular. There are also a couple of instances where prepositions might be used incorrectly, like "a long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a single name..." The word "betwixt" is archaic and might not be necessary here, but it's not a grammatical error per se. 

There are also some awkward phrasings, like "the entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to be accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own disposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest masters of the Italian renaissance." The structure here is a bit clunky and could be smoother. 

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and organization of the text. The text is a detailed analysis of Millet's life and work, so I need to check if the ideas are presented in a logical sequence and if there are any abrupt shifts or unclear transitions.

The text is quite long and detailed, so it's possible that some sections might be repetitive or have unclear connections. For example, in the section discussing Millet's early life, there's a lot of detail about his family and upbringing, but it might not be clearly connected to his development as an artist in a way that's immediately obvious. 

There are also some instances where the text jumps between topics without clear transitions. For example, after discussing Millet's migration to Paris, the text moves into his time with Delaroche and then abruptly shifts to his financial struggles. These transitions could be smoother. 

Additionally, the text sometimes uses complex sentences that might be confusing. For instance, "He had not intended, in painting such a picture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists with its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour." This sentence is a bit convoluted and could be clearer.

Overall, the text is well-written and informative, but there are a few issues with grammar, awkward phrasing, and transitions that could be improved. For fluency, I might give it a 4.5, as the text is mostly fluent but has some minor issues. For coherence, it's a bit more challenging, but I'd say a 4, as the structure is generally logical but could use some smoother transitions and clearer connections between ideas.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error in "An exhaustive research... have revealed" (should be "has revealed").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality... is to be accounted for, firstly...; and, secondly..." (cumbersome structure).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic word use ("betwixt") without contextual justification.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structure in "He had not intended... astonish his fellow artists..." (redundant clauses).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of themes (e.g., Millet's peasant focus) without clear progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biographical details and artistic analysis (e.g., early life to Paris migration).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connections between Milletâ€™s upbringing and his artistic philosophy in early chapters.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "the Dutchmen" without prior definition in some contexts.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
