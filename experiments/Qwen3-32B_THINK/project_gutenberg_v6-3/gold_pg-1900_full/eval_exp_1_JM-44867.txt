Alright, let's analyze this text according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll evaluate the fluency of the text. Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:
- [GRAMMAR] The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, with many long, run-on sentences.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some missing commas in complex sentences that could help with clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] The use of em dashes and other punctuation is inconsistent.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward phrasing that makes them difficult to follow.
- [SYNTAX] The text contains some passive voice constructions that could be simplified.
- [SPELLING] I don't see any obvious spelling errors in the text.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the academic tone of the essay.

While there are some grammatical and syntactical issues, the text is still generally readable and the ideas are conveyed. The complex sentence structures are appropriate for an academic philosophical essay, and the author is clearly trying to express sophisticated ideas.

Now, for coherence. Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, looking at logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, and how consistent and clear the narrative is.

Looking at the text:
- [LOGIC] The text presents a clear argument about two types of mind - one oriented toward the past and one toward the future.
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally well-structured, with clear transitions between ideas.
- [STRUCTURE] The essay has a logical flow, moving from defining the two types of mind to exploring their implications in various domains (morality, politics, etc.).
- [STRUCTURE] There is a clear introduction, development, and conclusion.
- [CLARITY] The concepts discussed are complex and abstract, but the author generally explains them clearly.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth.
- [LOGIC] Some sections could be more clearly connected to the central argument.
- [CLARITY] In some places, the dense prose and complex ideas make the text more difficult to follow.

Overall, the text is coherent and presents a well-structured argument. The author effectively explores the distinction between the two types of mind and its implications across various domains. The writing is dense and philosophical, but the ideas are generally well-connected and the progression of thought is logical.

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency and coherence as follows:

For fluency, the text has some grammatical and syntactical issues, but these don't significantly impede understanding. The complex sentence structures are appropriate for the academic nature of the text. I would give it a 4 on the fluency scale.

For coherence, the text presents a clear and logical argument with smooth transitions. The ideas are well-connected and the structure is effective for conveying the author's philosophical argument. I would give it a 4.5 on the coherence scale.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses that can be difficult to follow
- [GRAMMAR] Some missing commas in complex sentences
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in some constructions (e.g., "It will lead into my subject most conveniently to contrast and separate")
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of em dashes and other punctuation
- [SYNTAX] Some passive voice constructions that could be simplified

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text presents a clear argument about two types of mind (past-oriented and future-oriented) and its implications
- [STRUCTURE] The essay has a logical flow with clear transitions between ideas
- [CLARITY] Concepts are complex but generally well-explained
- [LOGIC] Some sections could be more clearly connected to the central argument
- [CLARITY] Dense prose and abstract concepts make the text challenging to follow in places

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
