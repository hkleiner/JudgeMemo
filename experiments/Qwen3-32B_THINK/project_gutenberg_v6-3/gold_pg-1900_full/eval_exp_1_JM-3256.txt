Let me evaluate the given text based on the criteria of fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Evaluation

Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to identify any issues that would disrupt the smooth flow of the text.

Looking through the text, I notice:
- Some sentences are quite long and complex, but they are well-structured and don't appear to be grammatically incorrect.
- The vocabulary is rich and appropriate to the context of books and bookmen.
- The punctuation is generally appropriate and doesn't appear to be problematic.
- There are some archaic or uncommon words that are used appropriately in the context.

I don't see any obvious grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or syntactical issues that would significantly affect the fluency of the text.

## Coherence Evaluation

Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, and how consistent and clear the narrative is.

Looking at the text:
- The text is a long essay about bookmen, their characteristics, and the author's personal reflections on books and reading.
- The essay is well-structured with a clear introduction and then a series of related topics.
- The author moves smoothly from one idea to another, often using transitions like "It is said," "There are those who," "It appears," etc.
- The essay maintains a consistent theme throughout - the nature of bookmen and their relationship with books.
- The author uses anecdotes and examples effectively to illustrate points.
- The ideas are logically connected and build upon each other.
- There are some complex ideas and concepts, but they are presented in a way that maintains the reader's understanding.

I don't see any significant issues with the logical flow or structure of the text. The essay is well-organized and the ideas are presented in a coherent manner.

## Final Assessment

Based on my evaluation:

Fluency: The text is highly fluent with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.

Coherence: The text is highly coherent with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.

My final scores:
- Fluency: 5
- Coherence: 5

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested format.
