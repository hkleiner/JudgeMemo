I need to evaluate the given text on two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. Let me carefully read through the text and identify any issues.

First, I'll look for fluency issues which relate to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Boucher had a quick eye for the mode. And he straightway set himself to the painting of "La Belle Cuisini√®re."" - This sentence has an unnecessary "And" at the beginning.
- [GRAMMAR] "It was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize at the Academy with his picture of "Evilmerodach, son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father had for a long time held him."" - The sentence structure is awkward and convoluted.
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large significance to the young fellow's craftsmanship." - This is an awkward phrasing that should be "There was a thing that happened" or "Something happened."
- [GRAMMAR] "He completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility, and thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his art, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its inevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went..." - The sentence is extremely long and complex with multiple clauses.
- [GRAMMAR] "He won for; was, in Paris this them-to nominated, his to return he eighth, year his "on" the twenty Academy." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a jumble of words.
- [GRAMMAR] "It a repute stir increased, and caused his fine greatly." - This sentence is incoherent and does not make grammatical sense.
- [GRAMMAR] "In picture strikes personal ends and Italian own this he his period his note." - This sentence is incoherent and does not make grammatical sense.
- [GRAMMAR] "He was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the Pompadour was a school-girl of twelve." - The phrasing is awkward and the meaning is unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] "He was painting for the queen's apartments at thirty-one when the Pompadour was a school-girl of twelve." - This sentence is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] "The Pompadour's power so greatly increased that she openly took command of the king's will; dared and succeeded in getting his favourite Maurepas banished; and herself took to the use of the kingly "we."" - The sentence is very long with multiple clauses.
- [GRAMMAR] "Boucher was so firmly established in 1750, his forty-seventh year, that he moved into a new house in the Rue Richelieu, near the Palais Royal." - The phrasing is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "When hailed award riot Academicians, provoked the took by enthusiastic de of place insulted but the Prix Academicians the, students the Boucher by in, with the their Rome 1767 applause." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a jumble of words.
- [GRAMMAR] "France degradation for thereby of the his to painter upstart the himself first nor the to Boucher, with king further made the of countess king, against now he nor of neither Choiseul the enemy, signified throne the remonstrances, scorn unconcealed of this dangerous." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a jumble of words.

Now, I'll look for coherence issues which relate to logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and consistent and clear structure.

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is structured as a biography, but there are many abrupt transitions between different periods in Boucher's life without clear connections.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs jump from one topic to another without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as the long sentence about Boucher's work on tapestries.
- [LOGIC] The chronology of events is sometimes unclear or confusing, particularly in the section about Boucher's Italian tour.
- [CLARITY] The meaning of some sentences is unclear due to awkward phrasing and word choice.
- [LOGIC] The connection between some events and their consequences is not always clear.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences contain multiple ideas that are not clearly separated, making it difficult to understand the main point.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information out of chronological order, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex with multiple clauses, making it difficult to understand the main point.
- [LOGIC] The transition between the chapter on Boucher's student years and his marriage is abrupt and lacks context.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are ambiguous in meaning due to awkward phrasing.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes jumps between different aspects of Boucher's life without clear connections or transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are difficult to understand due to the use of archaic or unfamiliar language.

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency: The text has a number of grammatical issues, some awkward phrasing, and a few incoherent sentences. However, most of the text is readable and the errors don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but contains enough grammatical issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.

For Coherence: The text has some issues with logical sequencing and transitions between ideas. There are a few abrupt shifts and some unclear connections between events. However, the overall narrative is generally coherent and the story of Boucher's life is mostly clear. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me finalize my evaluation:
