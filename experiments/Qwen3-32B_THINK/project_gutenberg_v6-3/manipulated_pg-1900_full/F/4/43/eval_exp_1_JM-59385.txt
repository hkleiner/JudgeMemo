Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the text for Fluency and Coherence issues according to the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. The text is quite long, so I'll scan through it.

Looking at the first few paragraphs, I notice some awkward phrasing and possible grammar issues. For example, "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels." The second sentence feels a bit awkward in structure. Also, there are some run-on sentences and comma splices. 

Further down, there's a line: "Ancient into that convert she custom wealth shall household the precious father inherits bride from ’sthe betrothed her rules stones." This seems like a jumble of words, possibly a syntax error. The possessive apostrophe is misplaced as well. 

Another example: "The latter had been a trifle curt. Kuei Ping had wept bitter tears over it since, because she had failed the person she admired most in all the world." The comma after "since" might be unnecessary. 

There are also some spelling issues, like "sway of the tapestried box-like chairs" – "tapestried" is correct, but maybe "tapestry" is more common. Also, "the coming alliance with an official family was not beyond the knowledge of Wong Lui" – "beyond the knowledge" is a bit awkward. 

Looking at the section where the text is fragmented: "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia" – this is a heading but written as a sentence fragment. 

Now for Coherence. The story follows Kuei Ping's life, but there are some abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. For example, the text jumps from the wedding to the birth of her child with little transition. Also, some paragraphs are very long and dense, making it hard to follow the flow. 

The narrative structure is mostly chronological, but there are instances where the timeline is unclear. For example, the section about the engagement and the soothsayers is detailed but might be confusing in its placement. 

There's also a lack of clear transitions between different parts of the story. For instance, the section about the engagement bracelets and the silver medal is introduced without much context, making it feel a bit disconnected. 

Some parts of the text are repetitive, like the descriptions of the courtyard and the rituals, which could have been tightened for better coherence. 

Overall, the story has a clear progression, but the execution has some issues with flow and transitions.
