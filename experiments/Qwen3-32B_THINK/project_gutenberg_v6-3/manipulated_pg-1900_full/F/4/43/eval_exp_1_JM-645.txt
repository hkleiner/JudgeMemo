Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency of the text. The first thing I notice is that the text is a novel excerpt, so it's expected to have complex sentences and literary language. However, there are some issues. I see a lot of [GRAMMAR] problems, like subject-verb agreement errors and incorrect verb tenses. For example, "He had done more things than I, and earned more pence" uses "had" correctly, but later sentences like "I could only however that evening declare to him..." are awkward and confusing.

Next, [SYNTAX] issues are present. Some sentences are run-on or have incorrect punctuation, making them hard to follow. For instance, "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?" has a comma splice. Also, there are missing commas and incorrect use of semicolons.

[LEXICON] problems include the use of archaic or obscure words without context, making the meaning unclear. For example, "He had showed me Gwendolen’s photograph with the remark that she wasn’t pretty but was awfully interesting" uses "awfully" in a way that might be confusing to modern readers.

Looking at [SPELLING], there are a few errors, like "want dear hand, ’swant myself The to that _he_ book begun!" which is clearly a typo. Also, "in banged say it to Even man had before pray, sense prepare I, door to the I had what." This sentence is incoherent and likely a result of a spelling mistake or formatting error.

Now, for Coherence. The narrative is a complex literary work, so some complexity is expected. However, [LOGIC] issues are present. The plot jumps between different timelines and perspectives without clear transitions. For example, the story shifts from the narrator's experience with Corvick to Vereker's character without clear connections, making it hard to follow the main narrative thread.

[STRUCTURE] problems include the lack of clear paragraph breaks and the use of long, meandering sentences that don't clearly separate ideas. This makes the text feel disjointed. For example, the transition from one character's perspective to another is abrupt, which can confuse the reader.

[CLARITY] is also an issue. Some parts of the text are ambiguous. For example, "He had had a telegram from Gwendolen Erme in answer to his letter offering to fly to her aid." The sequence of events here is a bit unclear, making it hard to follow the cause and effect.

[TRANSITION] issues are evident in the way the text moves from one scene to another. The lack of transitional phrases or sentences makes the narrative feel choppy. For example, the shift from the narrator's thoughts to Corvick's actions is abrupt and not well connected.

Putting this all together, the Fluency score is affected by multiple grammatical and syntactical errors, as well as some spelling and lexical issues. The Coherence score is impacted by logical inconsistencies, structural problems, lack of clarity, and poor transitions. Considering the scale, I would rate Fluency as a 3 because the text is generally readable but has enough issues to disrupt the flow. Coherence is also a 3 because the narrative is somewhat coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "He had showed me Gwendolen’s photograph...").  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and comma splices (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic/ambiguous phrasing without contextual clarity (e.g., "It’s the finest fullest intention of the lot").  
- [SPELLING] Typos and incoherent fragments (e.g., "want dear hand, ’swant myself The to that _he_ book begun!").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts in narrative perspective (e.g., sudden transitions between characters without clear cause-effect).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed paragraphing and lack of clear scene boundaries.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "He had had a telegram from Gwendolen Erme...").  
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitional phrases between scenes (e.g., abrupt shifts from dialogue to internal monologue).
