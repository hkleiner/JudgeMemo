Alright, I'll analyze the text according to the instructions. I need to evaluate it for fluency and coherence, identify the most serious problems in each category, and provide scores on a 1-5 scale.

For fluency, I'll look for issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation that might disrupt the smooth reading of the text.

For coherence, I'll assess the logical progression of ideas, the connection between sentences and paragraphs, the overall structure of the narrative, and the clarity of the text.

Let me go through the text carefully:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. There are several grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "For it to is application a if not science be what profession of the life?" This sentence is grammatically incoherent.
2. There are instances of awkward or incorrect word order: "The employment so of is to of to live outside that household apparent employees place ought advisability their it every having appeal one."
3. There are missing or incorrect punctuation marks in several places: "The publication of the day have caricatured the situation until it has become an outworn jest. The present system of housekeeping can no longer stand. One of two things must occur. Either the housewife must adopt business principles in ruling her household, or she will find before many more years elapse there will be no longer any woman willing to place her neck under the domestic yoke."
4. There are some misspelled words: "present termed, the, belong the 's home what however provided is protection that who class employer at women of "present the," does not to statistics by servant 'too' upon morality clearly proveand immorality the only protect."
5. Some sentences have incorrect word usage: "The remaining branches of housekeeping apparently do not interest the modern housewife. She entrusts them very generally to her employees, upon whose skill and knowledge she blindly relies."

**Coherence Issues:**
1. The text has a clear structure with numbered chapters and parts, but there are some abrupt transitions between sections.
2. Some paragraphs jump from one topic to another without clear connections: "The publication of the day have caricatured the situation until it has become an outworn jest. The present system of housekeeping can no longer stand. One of two things must occur. Either the housewife must adopt business principles in ruling her household, or she will find before many more years elapse there will be no longer any woman willing to place her neck under the domestic yoke."
3. The text has a consistent theme of housework and domestic labor, but some sections have a disjointed feel as they jump between different aspects of the topic.
4. There are some instances where the logical progression of ideas is unclear: "There are only a few women to-day who regard domestic science in the light of a profession, or a business, although in reality it is both."

Now, I'll summarize my findings and provide scores:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some misspellings that would disrupt the smooth reading experience. However, the content is still generally understandable despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 out of 5.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a clear structure with a consistent theme, but there are some abrupt transitions and occasional disjointed sections. The logical progression of ideas is generally clear, but there are some places where the connections between paragraphs are not as smooth as they could be. I would rate this as a 3.5 out of 5.
