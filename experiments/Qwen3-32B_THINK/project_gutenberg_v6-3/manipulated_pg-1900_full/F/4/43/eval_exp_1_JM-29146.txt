Let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

I'll look for problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text. For example:
   - "ith" instead of "is"
   - "thith" instead of "this"
   - "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain"
   - "ecthra-planetarieth" instead of "extra-planetaries"
   - "ecth" instead of "ex"
   - "thurrender" instead of "surrender"
   - "thith" instead of "this"
   - "thtink" instead of "think"
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard"
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard"
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)
   - "thtandard" instead of "standard" (repeated)

2. There are several instances of awkward or incorrect word order:
   - "He space from transferring Irwadians technical a difficult the through in was space move, also again been years the he that space a had to for normal-and but hyper knew knew theory starship tremendously normal many contemplating back task."
   - "He imagine which scene had at planet today on fifty no being here his all duplicated, this native fifty business could outworld on on ships ships Irwadi."
   - "Symm leered at her quite drunkenly and took hold of her slender arm. "What did you tell him? For the latht time."
   - "He said curtly: "Let go of her, Symm. She told me nothing that would interest you."
   - "He had finally managed to draw his m.g. gun, but the crowd of outworlders closed between them and there was no chance he could hit Ramsey or the girl. Retching, he had dirtied the glossy green scales of his chest."

   - "He stood on the threshold, uncertain. The voice had spoken not Interstellar Coine, but English. It had spoken English, without a foreign accent."
   - "And it was a girl's voice."
   - "Still, it could have been an elaborate trick. It was unlikely, but not impossible, that Garr Symm had learned Ramsey's identity already and had sent an operative here to await him. Ramsey and the Vegan girl had come on foot. It was a long walk."
   - "I'm armed," Ramsey lied. "Come over here. Slowly. Don't put any lights on." He could feel the Vegan girl trembling next to him. Not able to understand English, she didn't know what was going on."
   - "You're armed," the unseen girl's voice said in crisp, amused English, "like I'm a six-legged Antarean spider-man. You have an m.g. gun, Ramsey. It's in this room. I have it. That's all you have. No, don't try to lie to me. I'm a telepath. I can read you. Come in and put the light on and shut the door. You may bring the girl with you if you want."
   - "Brother, is she ever radiating fear! It's practically drowning your own mind out."
   - "The was Ramseyunseen girl, knew. She could read minds. She had proved it to him. Which left him this choice: he could grab the Vegan girl's arm again and get the heck out of there, or do what the unseen Earth girl told him to do. He wanted that m.g. gun. He took the Vegan girl's hand and advanced over the threshold and closed the door and switched on the light."
   - "He took the Vegan girl's hand and advanced over the threshold and closed the door and switched on the light."

3. There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation:

   - "On harsh Irwadi, laughter would have been a cultural anomaly."
   - "He expanded his scaly green barrel chest and declaimed: "At 0400 hours thith morning, the government of Irwadi hath planetarithed the Irwadi Tranthfer Thervith.""
   - "Ramsey read the official document, scowled, and handed over his Irwadi pilot license."
   - "The Polaris was a Centaurian ship he'd been scheduled to take through hyper-space on the run from Irwadi to Centauri III."
   - "Our problem, captain. Not yourth."
   - "That was true enough. Ramsey shrugged."
   - "Ramsey shrugged. Like all extra-planetaries on a bleak, friendless world like Irwadi, he'd regularly gambled away and drank away his monthly paycheck in the interstellar settlement which the Irwadians had established in the Old Quarter of Irwadi City."
   - "But last month he'd managed to come out even at the gaming tables, so he had a few hundred credits to his name."

   - "Ramsey went up the gangway and got his gear from the Polaris."
   - "When he returned down the gangway, the late afternoon wind was blowing across the spacefield tarmac, a wet, bone-chilling wind which only the reptile-humanoid Irwadians didn't seem to mind."

   - "Of course, Irwadi was an important planet-of-call in the Galactic Federation because the vital metal titanium was found as abundantly in Irwadian soil as aluminum is found in the soil of an Earth-style planet."
