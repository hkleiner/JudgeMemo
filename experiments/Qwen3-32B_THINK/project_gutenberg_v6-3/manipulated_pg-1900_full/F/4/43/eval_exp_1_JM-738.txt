Let me evaluate this text for fluency and coherence according to the criteria provided.

First, I'll go through the text looking for fluency issues:

1. Grammatical errors:
   - "He Readings series of a abandoned new therefore." (There's a missing article and the word order is incorrect)
   - "On reader the, of with surprises his his seek perhaps game in," (Word order is completely wrong)
   - "Jasper, having worked out this problem, accepts Crisparkle’s proposal, and his assurances about Neville, and shows Crisparkle a diary in which he has entered his fears that Edwin’s life is in danger from Neville." (Run-on sentence)
   - "The him and Jasper from that, return touches falls, to hand asleep something something, “dreams and pair falls leaves that him his Durdles the crypt." (Very jumbled and confusing)
   - "The watch and weir timbers, apparently pin (Edwin finds ’s book pool and impression in), river the day in such Crisparkle, next scarf, below his on rich underchain in the night the at psychical; the phenomena-mysterious telepathic some is visits." (Very jumbled and confusing)
   - "For might Helena be, disguise Datchery given in reasons the." (Fragmented sentence)
   - "He “whisper dark in if, speaks a in as the and.”" (Very jumbled and confusing)
   - "Datchery, “with a sudden change of countenance, gives her a sudden look.”" (Grammatically correct but seems out of context)

2. Spelling errors:
   - "Readings series of a abandoned new therefore." (Should be "abandoned a new therefore")
   - "The him and Jasper from that, return touches falls, to hand asleep something something..." (Multiple misspellings)
   - "The watch and weir timbers, apparently pin (Edwin finds ’s book pool and impression in), river the day in such Crisparkle, next scarf, below his on rich underchain in the night the at psychical; the phenomena-mysterious telepathic some is visits." (Multiple misspellings)

3. Syntax issues:
   - "He Readings series of a abandoned new therefore." (Poor sentence structure)
   - "On reader the, of with surprises his his seek perhaps game in," (Poor sentence structure)
   - "The him and Jasper from that, return touches falls, to hand asleep something something..." (Poor sentence structure)
   - "The watch and weir timbers, apparently pin (Edwin finds ’s book pool and impression in), river the day in such Crisparkle, next scarf, below his on rich underchain in the night the at psychical; the phenomena-mysterious telepathic some is visits." (Poor sentence structure)
   - "For might Helena be, disguise Datchery given in reasons the." (Poor sentence structure)

4. Lexicon issues:
   - Some phrases are awkward or don't make complete sense due to poor word choices or word order.

Now for coherence issues:

1. Logical flow:
   - Some paragraphs jump from one idea to another without clear transitions
   - The text often introduces new characters or plot elements without sufficient setup
   - The narrative sometimes becomes confusing with multiple characters and subplots

2. Structure:
   - The text has a clear structure with chapters and sections, but the flow within paragraphs is often disjointed
   - Some paragraphs are very long and contain multiple ideas that are not well connected

3. Clarity:
   - There are many instances where the meaning is unclear due to poor sentence structure
   - Some sentences are so convoluted that it's difficult to determine what is being said
   - The text often uses complex vocabulary that can be confusing without proper context

4. Transitions:
   - There are few clear transitions between paragraphs
   - The text sometimes jumps from one topic to another without explanation
   - Some sentences begin with "Meanwhile" or "However" but don't clearly connect to the previous content

Based on my assessment:

For Fluency:
- The text has numerous grammatical errors that affect readability
- There are many spelling errors that make the text difficult to follow
- The syntax is often poor, with run-on sentences and confusing sentence structures
- Some of the word choices and phrasing make the text harder to understand

For Coherence:
- The text has a clear overall structure but lacks smooth transitions between ideas
- The narrative is complex and at times confusing, especially with the multiple characters and plot elements
- The text sometimes jumps from one idea to another without sufficient explanation
- There are long paragraphs that contain multiple ideas without clear organization

Now I'll assign final scores:

Fluency: I would rate this at a 2.5. The text has many grammatical and spelling errors that make it difficult to read. The syntax is often poor, with many run-on and jumbled sentences. However, some parts of the text are readable and make sense.

Coherence: I would rate this at a 3. The text has a clear overall structure with chapters and sections, but the flow within paragraphs is often disjointed. The narrative is complex and at times confusing, with many characters and plot elements. The text sometimes jumps from one idea to another without sufficient explanation, but the overall story is somewhat coherent.
