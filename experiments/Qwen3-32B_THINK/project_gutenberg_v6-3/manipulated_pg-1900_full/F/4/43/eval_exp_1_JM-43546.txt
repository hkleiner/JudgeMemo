Let me carefully analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

For fluency, I'll look for problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

For coherence, I'll examine the logical sequence of ideas, transitions between sections, clarity of progression, and overall narrative structure.

Let me go through the text systematically and identify any issues:

Fluency Issues:
1. There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, especially in dialogue. For example, the first chapter starts with a dash but no proper punctuation to separate the title from the content.
2. There are inconsistencies in capitalization - some chapter titles are capitalized properly, while others are not.
3. There are occasional spelling errors - "separated! OF, ROB ROY do have I that called think?" appears to have random capitalization and word order.
4. Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or have incorrect word order - "The boys were soon there as well, for the tea at half-past four in the afternoon is the favourite meal of the four which the Scotch usually eat during the day."
5. There are instances of run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
6. Some dialogue appears to have incorrect punctuation - "is said But the all news that," not Mrs. Gordon.
7. There are some grammatical errors - "There are such good things to eat then! First, there is shortbread, a sort of crisp cake, made with a great deal of sugar and butter, and very little flour, which melts away in your mouth."
8. Some sentences have incorrect word order - "You must know porridge is a good thing to begin the day on in winter in Scotland."
9. There are some missing or incorrect punctuation marks in dialogue - "Let at beezee ball Don the 's for-Sandyhour out recess school with."
10. Some sentences have awkward phrasing - "There is a saying that the people of St. Andrews do nothing but play golf, but this cannot be true, as St. Andrews has one of the four great Scotch Universities, and many very great and wise men have come from there; and you don't get to be a wise man by playing any kind of a game all of the time."

Coherence Issues:
1. The narrative jumps between different times and perspectives without clear transitions.
2. The story lacks a clear central narrative or plot, instead being a collection of vignettes and descriptions.
3. Some sections appear to be out of order or disconnected from the overall narrative - the second chapter appears to have garbled text.
4. There are some abrupt shifts in the narrative without clear explanations or transitions.
5. The text has a disjointed feel in places, with some sections not clearly connected to the overall theme.
6. Some descriptions are overly detailed and could be more concise.
7. The narrative sometimes shifts from one location or event to another without clear connections.
8. Some sections seem to be missing or have garbled text, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
9. The text appears to have some inconsistencies in time references and sequence of events.
10. Some sections appear to be missing or incomplete, disrupting the flow of the narrative.

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores for fluency and coherence:

For fluency, I would rate this text a 3.5. The text has several grammatical and punctuation issues that affect readability, but it is generally understandable and has a natural flow in many places.

For coherence, I would rate this text a 3.0. While it has some logical progression and clear descriptions, the narrative is somewhat disjointed with many abrupt shifts and disconnected sections. The text has a general theme but lacks a strong central narrative to tie everything together.
