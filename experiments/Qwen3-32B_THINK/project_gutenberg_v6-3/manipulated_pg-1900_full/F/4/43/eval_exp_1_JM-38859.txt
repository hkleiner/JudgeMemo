Let me analyze the text according to the given evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

## FLUENCY ANALYSIS

I need to look for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues I notice in the text:
- [GRAMMAR] "On incident the an not can pass without whichway I occurred mention." - This sentence is grammatically incoherent and has incorrect word order.
- [GRAMMAR] "The Ridge north occurred Snodgrass Snodgrass end the of, just at north the of house." - This sentence is a jumbled mess with no clear structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "But no our levity comrade was and our, you assure cold there in stiff I dead for was lying midst." - This sentence is incoherent and has incorrect grammar.
- [GRAMMAR] "Rebel March from in the regain his camp help Gen. field Gen. on 9th to Kilpatrick arrived time we Hampton." - This sentence is jumbled and grammatically incorrect.
- [GRAMMAR] "Grand Review, a for north for sights ways started Washington an, with weary D. hearts the and from the gratitude our, with days arriving home end three 1865 19 and the the where Richmond 4 flushed, country we Va. city in took Glory at soldiers to, C. surrendered this over Old, then, filled over Johnson was and that victory 26 long poor historic and we up, but still in waved we May Washington, taking march come, camped participated, war June, April finally that around undivided had, and via, Sherman." - This is a completely incoherent sentence with no clear structure or meaning.
- [GRAMMAR] "That was at close quarters after the roar of musketry, with bayonets and clubbed rifles." - This sentence has an incorrect structure and lacks clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] "And how about the Gray? First Texas at Antietam 82 per cent, 21st Georgia at Manassas 78 per cent, 26th North Carolina at Gettysburg 72 per cent, 6th Mississippi at Shiloh 71 per cent." - This is not a proper sentence structure and lacks necessary articles and verbs.
- [GRAMMAR] "They printed no casualty lists then. The day after one of these battles the whole Chicago Tribune would not have been big enough to hold the names." - This is a run-on sentence that should be split.
- [GRAMMAR] "The regiment participated in the battles of Chickamauga, Mission Ridge," - This sentence is cut off mid-phrase.
- [GRAMMAR] "Owing to the late writing of these incidents of army life many things worthy of mention have been left out of their proper place." - This sentence has an awkward structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "The author of this enlisted June 7, 1862, returned home July 3rd, 1865." - This sentence is missing a subject and has awkward phrasing.

There are many grammatical errors and jumbled sentences throughout the text, especially towards the end. The text has some fluent sections, but the overall fluency is significantly impacted by these errors.

## COHERENCE ANALYSIS

I need to assess the logical progression of ideas, transitions between ideas, clarity of the narrative, and consistency of structure.

Issues I notice in the text:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin abruptly with specific events without setting up the context.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has many short paragraphs that don't flow smoothly into one another.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative often shifts from one battle or event to another without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes refers to people, places, or events without sufficient context.
- [LOGIC] Some sentences or paragraphs seem disconnected from the overall narrative.
- [LOGIC] The text has a very linear structure but with many abrupt shifts between different events and time periods.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin with specific events without connecting them to the broader narrative.

The text is a chronological account of military service during the Civil War. It has a clear structure in that it follows a timeline, but the transitions between events are often abrupt. Some paragraphs are disconnected from the main narrative and seem to introduce new topics without sufficient context.

## FINAL RATING

For Fluency:
The text has numerous grammatical errors, jumbled sentences, and awkward phrasing throughout. While there are some fluent sections, the many errors significantly impact readability. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

For Coherence:
The text has a chronological structure, which provides some coherence, but it often jumps between events without clear transitions. There are many abrupt shifts and some disconnected paragraphs. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale.
