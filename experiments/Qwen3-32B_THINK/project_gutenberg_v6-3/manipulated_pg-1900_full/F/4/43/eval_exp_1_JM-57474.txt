Alright, let me start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence using the specified criteria. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite long and dense, so I'll go through it step by step.

Looking at the beginning, there are some issues. For example, the line "I this appear are against go agree which that facts to there movement." This seems like a run-on sentence with incorrect word order. It's hard to parse. Then later, "These day indeed having female as lands and no far struggles the, secured of concessions the stalwart exponents; off have emancipation for women sex the especially are-equal, class the clamouring as during, longer democracy rights for their fight, and attained as most but in many-political demands the have, is for of men for ever, of while been industrial, advantages gained middle to, some of most emancipation women." This is a jumbled sentence with multiple grammatical errors and incorrect word order. These are clear fluency issues under [GRAMMAR] and [SYNTAX].

There are also instances of missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, in "In Russia, in the village communes, women were able to take an equal share with men, in certain cases, in the government of the communes." The commas are used correctly here, but later in the text, some sentences are missing necessary commas or periods, leading to run-ons. 

Spelling errors are minimal, but I notice "Suffragettes" is spelled correctly, but there are instances where hyphens are missing in compound adjectives, like "middle-class women" which is correct, but other compound terms might not be. 

Moving to coherence, the text is a political speech discussing Woman Suffrage from a Social-Democratic perspective. The main idea is to argue that Woman Suffrage is a social necessity rooted in capitalist production and the need for proletarian unity. However, there are some coherence issues. 

The structure is generally logical, but some sections jump abruptly from one point to another. For example, the transition from discussing historical movements to statistics about women in the workforce is somewhat jarring. Additionally, some paragraphs are very long and dense, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. 

There are also instances where the argument is not clearly connected. For example, when discussing the middle-class women's movement, the connection to the main argument about proletarian suffrage is sometimes unclear. The text also includes several footnotes and references to specific historical events and figures, which might be confusing for a reader not familiar with the context. 

Some parts of the text seem to repeat ideas without adding new information, which could be considered [REPETITION]. For example, the emphasis on the difference between middle-class and proletarian suffrage is repeated multiple times, which might be necessary for emphasis but can affect coherence if not handled well.

In terms of clarity, the text uses complex sentences and specialized terminology that might be challenging for a general audience. However, given the context of a political speech, this might be appropriate. 

Overall, while the text is coherent in its main argument, the dense structure, long paragraphs, and some abrupt transitions could be improved. The fluency issues, particularly the grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, do affect readability but not to the point of making the text completely unintelligible.
