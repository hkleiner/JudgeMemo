I'll evaluate the given text based on the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, let me analyze the text for fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "One his vibrant Venice it of remains of with and, mark filled wish through surprising glorify that transferred to nurtured-expression palette, Veronese which distinctive magnificence that is how her the of passionately of Venetian born; nor were the their to dazzling, joyous colour of understand, and, light achieved in the artist their, his city the eyes sea can school painters colour which that enamoured."
- [GRAMMAR] "When of was, completely from, the unanimous populace there received, well the approval as; as was the rejoicing the Veronese from, the church artists vote general public opened decorated to."
- [GRAMMAR] "The the found Tintoretto proofs, of embraced with, when painters rival city him morose his; praise in he chanced contemporaries happy and of in admiration their extremely of Veronese Titian to, fame him words overwhelmed some even which the great to in amiable Venice painter streets meet."
- [GRAMMAR] "It probable all painted them painted of or metres a the could by--seven necessarily portraits canvas--of scarcely could in the brief large the family, a have friendly that of are which knowledge fourteen, Pisani figures his so he that, visit space without is in Veronese have."
- [GRAMMAR] "Veronese work but seek in to in had be of that he was it executing to that skill, not less and than deserving it business his soliciting honours for replied them."
- [GRAMMAR] "These palace rich adorned merchants had had greatest in the painters by the Venice. Giorgione and Titian had decorated its walls not only within, but also on the exterior, where traces of the paintings can still be seen."
- [GRAMMAR] "The surprise experienced in the presence of this noble work, executed with the energy of a master-hand, is surpassed only by admiration for the versatility of a genius which could at will adapt itself to unfamiliar formulas."
- [GRAMMAR] "Veronese the remaining to privilege had rare young of end the."

For coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and concepts without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Veronese's style to Venice's history to his personal life with little connecting context.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, logical flow. Important information is scattered and not presented in a coherent sequence.
- [CLARITY] Many paragraphs are unclear or confusing in their meaning. The text often fails to clearly communicate its points.
- [TRANSITION] There are few or no transitional phrases to help the reader follow the progression of ideas.
- [LOGIC] The text frequently presents information out of chronological or thematic order, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] Some sections are incomplete or appear to be cut off mid-sentence.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new concepts or characters without sufficient context or explanation.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are extremely long and complex, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
- [STRUCTURE] There are inconsistencies in the way information is presented, with some details being overly detailed while others are barely mentioned.

Based on these observations:

For fluency:
The text contains numerous grammatical errors that significantly impact readability. Many sentences are incoherent or nonsensical. The text appears to have been written with a lack of attention to proper grammar and syntax. The most serious issues are the completely incoherent sentences that make no grammatical sense at all. I would rate this at a 2.5 on the fluency scale - it contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

For coherence:
The text lacks a clear structure and logical flow. It jumps between topics and concepts without clear transitions. The narrative is disjointed and difficult to follow. While there are some coherent sections, the overall coherence is significantly impacted by the lack of organization and clarity. I would rate this at a 2.5 on the coherence scale - the text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
