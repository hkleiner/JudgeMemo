Okay, let's start evaluating this text. The user wants me to rate it on fluency and coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, including half-points. First, I need to check for fluency issues. Fluency is about grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Looking through the text, I notice some parts that are a bit awkward. For example, in the "EARLY YEARS" chapter, there's a sentence that starts with "The long time fairy principal unluckily this in beloved they badly common always the tales: artists lives with admired of they have (end, all and the after and end of begin sometimes hero death a happily!)." This seems like a run-on or possibly a typo. The structure is confusing here. That's a [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example is in the "FIRST SUCCESS" chapter: "Mention Chevigné by his ends for the by for Lamartine of made two de 1858, chapter The--this last that ago served and Rémois plates--illustrations edition career in the Painted did volumes twenty here, and the (must of drawings unobtainable, date Angel Contes by series), Fallen years M. that, artistic be bears Frenchmen; Themselves already this as he later." This is a jumbled sentence with missing words and incorrect word order. That's a [GRAMMAR] and [SYNTAX] problem.

There's also a part in the "MILITARY PAINTINGS" chapter: "Commander was two active at 1855 and Fine he (thirty grand the of of industrious at and official golden honours nevertheless singularly rungs, of Legion of-Academy, received forty he-of, became Universelle one 1861 Officer medal member always Knight fifty a, the Meissonier the of in successively Arts all of Honour Exposition mounted), at the made a led age the the at life." This sentence is a mess, with misplaced commas and missing words. Definitely a [GRAMMAR] and [SYNTAX] issue.

Moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a biography of Meissonier, and while it's generally well-structured, there are some jumps. For example, in the "INTRODUCTION" chapter, the anecdote about the cavalry charge is clear, but then the transition to his early years is abrupt. The connection between the anecdote and his early life isn't smooth. That's a [TRANSITION] issue.

In the "ETCHINGS" chapter, the text mentions his etchings and their value but then suddenly shifts to discussing the technical aspects without much explanation. The flow between these points is a bit disjointed. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue.

Another problem is in the "PAINTINGS" chapter, where the text goes from discussing his techniques to a detailed analysis of specific paintings, but the transition between these sections isn't clear. The reader might lose the thread of the narrative. That's a [LOGIC] issue.

Overall, the text has some minor fluency issues that affect readability but don't completely hinder understanding. For coherence, there are a few abrupt transitions and structural issues, but the overall narrative is still logical. Considering these points, I'd rate fluency around 4 and coherence around 4.5.
