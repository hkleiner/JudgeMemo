I'll carefully evaluate the given text according to the criteria provided for fluency and coherence. Let me analyze the text in detail.

First, I'll identify fluency issues:

1. Grammatical errors: I notice several grammatical issues in the text:
   - "Was emancipated a I whose all it of--as and the joined men had by accepted of ranks us science raw enlightened not recruit?" This sentence is completely ungrammatical.
   - "There contains that teaching was of three most congenial of of of and volumes of opinion, the admitted sphere in I" - This is a run-on sentence with multiple issues.
   - "I find of unable been am--solution not I indeed to to Bergson--prepared ownM. have give 's the problem." This sentence has incorrect word order.

2. Spelling errors: There are some potential spelling issues:
   - "wellnigh" should be "well nigh" (though this might be intentional for poetic effect)
   - "of the upon with or such relatedness be things in this of certain nature formula susceptible and systems field of present are simple in can;" - This has numerous spelling and grammatical issues.

3. Syntax problems: There are several sentences with poor syntax:
   - "Of the theory of evolution I knew but little; but I none the less felt assured that it had come to stay and to prevail." - This sentence is awkwardly constructed.
   - "In a at any, rate avowedly passage, which our is 'it knowledge and Cause conception transcends some leading of the persistence." - This sentence has poor syntax.

4. Lexical issues: There are some awkward or unclear word choices:
   - "I have no very distinct recollection of the impression produced on my mind by the germinal essay of 1857" - The phrase "germinal essay" is somewhat unclear.
   - "The pity of it is that we know not, and can never know, what on earth (or in heaven!) it is." - The use of "pity" is somewhat out of place.

5. Punctuation issues: There are some punctuation problems:
   - "In any case Tyndall's suggestive sentence was here amplified and the underlying law was disclosed." - The sentence structure is awkward.
   - "But Spencer's Unknowable, notwithstanding its negative prefix, is the Ultimate Reality, and does all that is in any way done." - The punctuation doesn't help clarify the meaning.

Now for coherence issues:

1. Logical sequencing: While the text generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt shifts:
   - The transition from discussing Spencer's philosophy to Bergson's critique is somewhat abrupt.
   - The discussion of energy and force sometimes jumps between different concepts without clear transitions.

2. Structure: The text is quite long and complex, making it challenging to follow the overall structure:
   - There are many long, complex sentences that make it difficult to follow the logical flow.
   - Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without clear connections to the previous content.

3. Clarity: Some concepts are presented without sufficient explanation:
   - The discussion of "force" and "cause" is complex and sometimes unclear.
   - The concept of the "Unknowable" is central to the text but is sometimes discussed in a way that is difficult to follow.

4. Transition: While there are some good transitions, there are also places where the flow between ideas could be smoother:
   - Some paragraphs begin with "Now" or "But" without clear connections to the previous content.
   - The text sometimes shifts between different levels of abstraction without clear markers.

5. Repetition: There is some repetition of ideas, which could be streamlined:
   - The discussion of the relationship between matter and mind is repeated in slightly different forms in multiple sections.
   - Some concepts about evolution and relatedness are discussed from slightly different angles in different sections.

Based on my analysis, I'll now provide my final scores:

For fluency: The text has several grammatical errors, awkward syntax in some places, and some unclear word choices. However, it's generally readable and the main ideas are conveyed. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's readable but has noticeable issues that sometimes disrupt the flow.

For coherence: The text has a generally logical progression and covers complex philosophical concepts. However, the structure is sometimes challenging to follow, and some transitions between ideas could be smoother. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally coherent but has some noticeable issues with logical sequencing and transitions.
