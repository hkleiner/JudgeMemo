Alright, let's start evaluating the text for fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Issues
First, I'll look for issues related to fluency, which includes grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. **[GRAMMAR] "I than happened I better at had, and had wished, nearer as work, I it succeeded hand."** - This sentence is grammatically incoherent and doesn't make sense.
2. **[GRAMMAR] "I been overtaken the and if felt back brought had crest hill the the to as of he on city."** - This sentence is a jumble of words without clear structure.
3. **[GRAMMAR] "It and eagerness checked a drop me all paper moment made the."** - This is a jumbled sentence that doesn't make sense.
4. **[GRAMMAR] "It had been a big brush of wings, the flash of an opaline robe, and then, with a great cool stir of the air, the sense of an angel’s having swooped down and caught me to his bosom."** - While this is poetic, the structure is awkward and difficult to parse.
5. **[GRAMMAR] "I the, takes gather, larger latitude as, Forbes ’s to ground Guythe, that come simply the Dora same Walsingham has got."** - This sentence is a jumble of words and phrases with no clear meaning.
6. **[GRAMMAR] "The idea he now communicated had all the freshness, the flushed fairness, of the conception untouched and untried: it was Venus rising from the sea and before the airs had blown upon her."** - The sentence structure is awkward and confusing.
7. **[GRAMMAR] "I present throbbingly such an so been never unveiling had at."** - This sentence is completely incoherent.
8. **[GRAMMAR] "I than happened I better at had, and had wished, nearer as work, I it succeeded hand."** - This sentence is grammatically incoherent and doesn't make sense.
9. **[GRAMMAR] "The idea of his security became supremely dear to me, and I asked myself if I were the same young man who had come down a few days before to scatter him to the four winds."** - The sentence is confusing and the word "scatter him to the four winds" is not clear in this context.
10. **[GRAMMAR] "I have a general faith in his having behaved well, and I had once, in London, taken Mrs. Paraday down to dinner."** - The phrase "having behaved well" is awkward and the sentence is confusing.

### Coherence Issues
Now I'll look for issues related to coherence, which includes logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clear progression, and consistency.

1. **[LOGIC] The text jumps between different time points and perspectives without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative.**
2. **[LOGIC] The relationship between the narrator and Neil Paraday is not clearly established, making it hard to understand their dynamic.**
3. **[LOGIC] The motivations and actions of characters like Mr. Pinhorn and Mr. Morrow are not clearly explained.**
4. **[LOGIC] The plot developments are sometimes confusing, especially the sequence of events around the manuscript and the character interactions.**
5. **[LOGIC] The narrative frequently shifts between different characters and perspectives without clear markers, making it hard to follow the main story.**
6. **[LOGIC] The ending is confusing, with the narrator's relationship with the young lady not clearly explained.**
7. **[LOGIC] The text contains many subplots and character interactions that are not well integrated into the main narrative.**
8. **[LOGIC] The resolution of the manuscript plot is not clear, leaving the reader confused about its fate.**

### Final Scores
For **Fluency**, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow. While some of these are minor, the frequent and significant errors would lower the score. I would rate it a 2.5.

For **Coherence**, the narrative has significant issues with logical sequencing and transitions. The story is often confusing and difficult to follow. I would rate it a 2.5 as well.

Let me summarize my assessment in the required format.
