Let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll read through the text to understand its content and structure. This appears to be a historical account of Romsey Abbey, covering its architecture, history, and notable figures.

For fluency, I'll look for:
- Grammar issues
- Spelling mistakes
- Syntax problems
- Word choice issues
- Phrasing problems
- Punctuation errors

For coherence, I'll look for:
- Logical sequencing
- Smooth transitions
- Clear progression
- Consistent structure
- Avoidance of ambiguities
- Absence of abrupt jumps

Starting with fluency issues:

1. There are several instances of jumbled or reversed word order that make sentences difficult to understand:
   - "Yet Old this get the and we roomy if still written 'or' would another R没m avoids 'objection' or which often as derivation sometimes this, Rumsey adopt and English Island pronounced from more is Spacious mean is, whence room the Romsey we 'it derivation.'"
   - "But the through bridges, Abbey station Salisbury the streams who Redbridge of not from or at in from not minor realize in tunnels, or the line, by to, at beneath visitor and, spanned some his destination covered by small arrived been either have run an branch the, completely but Eastleigh are the or runs island that, he for when railway was arriving he Andover which that streets proceeds would via by the."

2. There are grammatical errors and incomplete sentences:
   - "It one namely and worthy Christian is the had, or of none Godgyfu only of note seventeen, nuns, that, of scriptural a remaining these name."
   - "The the both bays on of sides are two nave eastern peculiar."

3. Some sentences have incorrect word order or missing words:
   - "By was that it her erected 1268 by some has Isabella abbess was it Alicia Walrand de to daughter to, memory been, the who Kilpec supposed from of 1298."
   - "It the at the on Father, not head the the surrounded a; shown by Tree Christ wristhand Christ reigning but is dead 's above represents clouds."

4. There are punctuation issues, including missing commas and periods:
   - "The curious wooden erection on the top of the tower, somewhat resembling a hen coop or gigantic lobster pot, was added in comparatively recent times to contain the bells; drawings made at the beginning of the nineteenth century do not show it, but, those made about the middle of the century do."

5. There are some misspellings:
   - "R没m" instead of "Rum"
   - "Rumsey" instead of "Romsey"

6. There are some awkward phrasings that don't flow naturally:
   - "Other the room take church the more, done side was and already porch the destroyed intention was built porch time the it of Wykeham when place has, the Laurence vicar the of over of north of St. on with William a nave the of as a been the work to present described has of which, recently building in."

Now for coherence issues:

1. The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions:
   - It moves abruptly from architectural descriptions to historical accounts to biographical information without clear signposting.

2. Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous content:
   - For example, the section about the Romsey Psalter appears without clear introduction after discussing various relics.

3. The structure is somewhat disjointed at times, with information appearing in unexpected places:
   - The section about the abbesses is at the end, but information about specific abbesses appears earlier in the text.

4. Some sections are difficult to follow because they jump between different time periods or topics:
   - The account of the suppression of the nunnery is interwoven with earlier historical accounts without clear chronological markers.

5. There are some confusing references that don't clearly connect to what has been discussed:
   - For example, the text mentions "The #Front West#." and "The #South Side# of the Church" with pound signs that don't appear to be properly explained.

6. The text sometimes goes into great detail on one topic before abruptly switching to another:
   - For example, it discusses the architectural features of the church in great detail before shifting to the history of the abbesses.

Based on my assessment:

For fluency, the text has significant issues that affect readability, though it's generally understandable. The problems include jumbled sentences, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing. I would rate this around 2.5-3.

For coherence, the text has some logical flow, but it often jumps between topics without clear transitions. The structure could be improved with better organization and more clear signposting. I would rate this around 2.5-3 as well.

Let me finalize my ratings and list the most significant issues for each category.
