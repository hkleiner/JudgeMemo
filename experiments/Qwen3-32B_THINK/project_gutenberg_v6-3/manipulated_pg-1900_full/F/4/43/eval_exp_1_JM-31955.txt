Let me evaluate this long text based on the criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, I'll look at fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors in the text, such as "been was it the, had the a assemblage spot for and Indians of 'then trade.'" The sentence structure is incorrect.
- [GRAMMAR] Another example is "have though the never seen three they people And third I Barlow; have say said heard have such myself bows," I seen." This sentence is completely out of order.
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling issues, like "ancient of the the first first" and "it was this-who in, the through of settled;" which seem like typos.
- [SYNTAX] The text has many run-on sentences and some sentences with incorrect syntax. For example, "It Continent great part was a unquestionably, white this-who in, the through of settled;" is a jumbled sentence.
- [LEXICON] The word choice is generally appropriate for the historical context, but some phrases are awkward or confusing.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues, such as missing commas and periods in long sentences.

Now for coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, it moves from historical facts about Niagara to legends, then to scientific explanations of rainbows, then back to historical accounts.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is somewhat disjointed. While it has chapters, the flow between chapters and within chapters is not always logical or smooth.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are not clearly explained. For instance, the legends are presented but not always clearly differentiated from historical facts.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt. The text doesn't always provide clear signposts for the reader to follow the narrative.
- [REPETITION] There is some repetition of ideas and phrases throughout the text, which can make it feel redundant at times.

Based on my evaluation:

For fluency:
- The text has several grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures.
- There are some spelling mistakes and punctuation issues.
- However, the majority of the text is readable and the meaning is generally clear despite the errors.
- I would give this a score of 3.5 out of 5 for fluency. The text is generally readable but contains enough issues that affect the smooth reading experience.

For coherence:
- The text has a logical structure with chapters, but the flow between chapters and within chapters is not always smooth.
- There are some abrupt transitions and the text sometimes jumps between topics without clear connections.
- The organization is generally coherent but could be improved with better transitions and clearer delineation of ideas.
- I would give this a score of 3.5 out of 5 for coherence. The text is organized but has some issues with logical flow and transitions.
