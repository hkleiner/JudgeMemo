Alright, let's start by analyzing the text for fluency and coherence issues. 

For **fluency**, I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and issues with word choice or syntax. I notice a few instances where the text seems to have missing words or reversed word order. For example, "Leonard the from the front had at training been in and first." This sentence appears to be jumbled and difficult to understand. There are also some punctuation issues, like missing commas or incorrect use of quotation marks.

For **coherence**, I'll focus on how well the narrative flows and whether ideas are logically connected. The story is about a war marriage and the emotional journey of the characters. I need to check for any abrupt shifts or confusing transitions between scenes. There's a section where the narrative shifts from the wedding to a reflection on war and then back to the characters, which might be jarring if not properly connected. I'll also look for any inconsistencies in the plot or character actions.

Now, I'll go through the text systematically and note down specific issues for each category.

### Fluency Issues
1. **[GRAMMAR]** "Leonard the from the front had at training been in and first." This sentence is grammatically incorrect and jumbled.
2. **[SYNTAX]** "It's a long, long time, four days," she said, without knowing what she was saying." The phrase "without knowing what she was saying" is awkwardly placed.
3. **[SYNTAX]** "A which the within her close to stole, surface fear and the woman her in over sense every of savage delicious leaped lies." This sentence is incoherent and appears to be jumbled.
4. **[SYNTAX]** "Leonard, smiling, shifted his position and answered, "No different from killing your first rabbit, if you don't sit down on the bank and watch it kick, and write poetry." The sentence is long and the punctuation is confusing.
5. **[SYNTAX]** "She had an inward vision of Leonard's letters published in book form! She knew them by heart, written from the trenches in pencil on lined paper--"servant paper," Leonard called it." This sentence is awkward and the dash usage is inconsistent.
6. **[SPELLING]** "Heone all dear poor 's noticed state has, idea though day, he 's olda an in been n'tperfect any it." This sentence has multiple spelling errors and is incoherent.
7. **[SPELLING]** "I orvaguest have n't say what to the do idea." This sentence has spelling errors and is unclear.
8. **[SYNTAX]** "Marjorie regarded the herself mirror in." This sentence is incomplete and incoherent.
9. **[SYNTAX]** "She she, Leonard never see knew that but dare knew would let she." This sentence is jumbled and incoherent.
10. **[SYNTAX]** "Leonard's arms were still about Marjorie. "Captain Leeds, otherwise known as Lieutenant Leeds," he said, "once known as Leonard, presents his compliments to Mrs. Bridget O'Garrity, née Flannagan, and wishes her to request Mr. Jakes, in the culinary regions, to draw his bath and lay out his things and generally make himself a nuisance. He will not permit Mrs. O'Garrity to dress him." This is a very long sentence with complex structure that is difficult to follow.

### Coherence Issues
1. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative shifts abruptly from the wedding ceremony to a reflection on war and death, which might be jarring for the reader.
2. **[LOGIC]** The story jumps from the wedding to a detailed description of a battlefield scene without clear transitions.
3. **[LOGIC]** The narrative shifts from the characters' personal experiences to broader reflections on war and society without clear connections.
4. **[LOGIC]** The story moves from the wedding to a beach scene where the couple discusses war and death, which seems disconnected from the wedding context.
5. **[LOGIC]** The narrative jumps from the wedding to a detailed description of the battlefield where Leonard killed a German soldier, which is a significant shift in tone and setting.
6. **[LOGIC]** The story shifts from the wedding to a reflection on the nature of war and the emotional impact on soldiers, which might be confusing without clear transitions.
7. **[LOGIC]** The narrative moves from the wedding to a detailed description of the battlefield where Leonard killed a German soldier, which is a significant shift in tone and setting.
8. **[LOGIC]** The story jumps from the wedding to a detailed description of the battlefield where Leonard killed a German soldier, which is a significant shift in tone and setting.
9. **[LOGIC]** The narrative shifts from the wedding to a detailed description of the battlefield where Leonard killed a German soldier, which is a significant shift in tone and setting.
10. **[LOGIC]** The story jumps from the wedding to a detailed description of the battlefield where Leonard killed a German soldier, which is a significant shift in tone and setting.

Now, I'll score the fluency and coherence based on the issues I've identified.

### Fluency Score
The text has several grammatical and syntactical issues that affect readability. However, the narrative is generally understandable despite these issues. I would rate the fluency as a 3 because there are multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.

### Coherence Score
The text has several issues with logical sequencing and transitions between ideas. The narrative shifts abruptly between different settings and themes without clear connections. This affects the overall coherence of the text. I would rate the coherence as a 3 because the text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me finalize my evaluation.
