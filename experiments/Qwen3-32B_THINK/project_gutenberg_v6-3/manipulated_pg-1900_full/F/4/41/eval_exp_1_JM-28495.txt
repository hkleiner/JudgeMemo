I'll evaluate the given text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, let me analyze the text for fluency issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors are present, such as "bren" instead of "been", "lengtu" instead of "long", "commotted" instead of "committed", "perhaos" instead of "perhaps", "bren" instead of "been", etc.
- [SPELLING] There are multiple spelling errors throughout the text, such as "trem?" instead of "tremor?", "bren" instead of "been", "lengtu" instead of "long", "bren" instead of "been", "commotted" instead of "committed", "perhaos" instead of "perhaps", "bren" instead of "been", "werebhis" instead of "were his", "pedigrees were inclosed" instead of "enclosed", etc.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward or incorrect syntax, such as "He was a species of uniform" (should be "He wore a species of uniform"), "It is a curious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to maps and railroad time-tables" (awkward phrasing), etc.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation, such as missing commas in lists and incorrect use of quotation marks.
- [LEXICON] Some words are used inappropriately or incorrectly, such as "trem?" instead of "tremor?" or "tremor" (the context is unclear), "werebhis" instead of "were his", "bren" instead of "been", etc.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are missing periods at the end of some sentences, particularly in the dialogue.

Now, let me analyze the text for coherence issues:

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] There are some logical inconsistencies, such as the story suddenly jumping from the main narrative to a description of a coroner's jury in the middle of a train accident in Chapter VII.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is generally coherent as a narrative, but there are some abrupt transitions between scenes and thoughts that could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or confusing, such as the description of the train accident in Chapter VII, which is somewhat disjointed.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs or ideas are abrupt or unclear.
- [CONSISTENCY] There are some inconsistencies in character behavior or plot details, such as the sudden shift in the curate's behavior and motivations.
- [PLOT DEVELOPMENT] The plot development is generally coherent, but there are some unexpected plot twists or developments that feel a bit forced or unexplained.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these evaluations:

For fluency, the text has multiple spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability, but the overall narrative is still understandable. I would rate it a 2.5 on the scale.

For coherence, the narrative has a clear progression and the story is generally logical and well-structured, but there are some abrupt transitions and minor inconsistencies. I would rate it a 3.5 on the scale.

Let me double-check my assessment:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors that affect understanding
- [SPELLING] Numerous spelling mistakes throughout the text
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or incorrect sentence structure in several places
- [PUNCTUATION] Issues with punctuation that affect clarity
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate or incorrect word usage in some instances

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Some logical inconsistencies in the narrative
- [STRUCTURE] Generally coherent structure but with some abrupt transitions
- [CLARITY] Some unclear or confusing passages
- [TRANSITION] Issues with transitions between paragraphs or ideas
- [CONSISTENCY] Minor inconsistencies in character behavior or plot details

FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
