Alright, I need to evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand its content and identify any issues.

The text is an academic article discussing early woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts. It's quite long and detailed, with a lot of historical information and references to specific printers, books, and artists. 

Starting with fluency: I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice errors. The text is written in formal academic style, so I need to check for any awkward phrasing or errors that might disrupt the flow. I notice some instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, such as missing spaces after periods and commas. There are also some spelling errors like "ewsential" instead of "essential" and "medieæval" which is correct but might be less common. Some sentences are run-on and could be broken up for clarity. There are also instances where words are hyphenated incorrectly or used in a way that might be confusing.

For coherence: I need to assess how well the text is structured and how logically the ideas flow. The text is organized into sections and chapters, but some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. There are a few instances where the author jumps from one topic to another without clear connections. Some sections might be redundant or repetitive, which could affect the overall coherence. Also, the text references specific books and printers, and if these references are not clearly explained, it might be confusing for the reader. The flow of ideas in some paragraphs is a bit disjointed, making it harder to follow the author's argument.

Now, I'll list the specific issues for each category, categorizing them with appropriate labels. Then I'll determine the scores based on the criteria provided. I'll make sure to use half-points if necessary and avoid any corrections or explanations beyond the required format.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "ewsential" instead of "essential"  
- [SPELLING] "medieæval" (archaic but acceptable)  
- [SPELLING] "decoration" misspelled as "decoration" (repeated inconsistencies)  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with missing commas or periods (e.g., "the names under which the Ulm and Augsburg picture-books are known are all those of their printers. Of these by far the most distinguished are the kinsmen (their degree of kinship is not known), Gunther Zainer of Augsburg and John Zainer of Ulm.")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the first part of whuch was printed in 1471")  
- [SYNTAX] Missing spaces after periods and commas (e.g., "1471; but, as the most important from the artistic point of view, I should name:")  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Schoensperger, who printed right into the sixteenth century, used blocks which were ruder than the earlier ones, through carelessness, and I suppose probably because of the aim at cheapness; his books tend towards the chap-book kind.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifting from historical context to specific printer details without clear linkage)  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to unnamed artists and printers (e.g., "the names of the artists who designed these wood-blocks should not have been recorded")  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of information about printers and books (e.g., repeated mentions of Gunther Zainer without clear progression)  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed flow between sections (e.g., sudden shift from discussing woodcut books to illuminated manuscripts without transitional explanation)  
- [TRANSITION] Missing connections between historical periods and artistic styles (e.g., "the Renaissance" is referenced without clear contextual framing)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
