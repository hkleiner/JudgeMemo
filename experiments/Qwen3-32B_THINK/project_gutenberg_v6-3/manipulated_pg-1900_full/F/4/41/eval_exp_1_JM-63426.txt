Alright, let's start by looking at the text for fluency issues. First, I'll scan through it for any obvious grammar or spelling mistakes. I notice a few typos like "intdoduccion" instead of "introduction" and "Kvickar" instead of "McVickar". There are also some missing or incorrect punctuation, like missing commas and periods. For example, in the line "It is graduation day in thevlittle brown schoolhouse..." there's a missing space between "the" and "vlittle". 

Next, I'll check for syntax and word choice. The sentence structure is mostly clear, but there are some awkward phrasings. For instance, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that sprijgboard he took off into a career..." has a typo in "sprijgboard" and the phrase "took off into a career" is a bit informal for the context. Also, some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for better readability, like the one starting "In America, these goings-on were known to amfew connoisseurs amid a vast indifference."

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, so the structure should follow a logical progression. I'll check if the ideas are connected smoothly. The chapters are well-titled and seem to follow a chronological order, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from the introduction to "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" is a bit sudden without a clear transition. Also, some paragraphs jump between topics without clear links, like from discussing the printing press to the father's illness.

I'll also look for consistency in the narrative. The text mentions different time periods and events, but sometimes the connections between them are not clear. For instance, the transition from the early career in printing to the later chapters about the Wayside Press could be smoother. Additionally, some terms are used inconsistently, like "Caslon" being spelled with and without a hyphen in different parts of the text.

Overall, the text has a few fluency issues that could be corrected with proofreading, and some coherence issues where transitions and connections between ideas could be improved. However, the content is rich and the story is engaging, which helps maintain overall readability despite these issues.
