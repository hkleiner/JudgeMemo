Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The user provided a long essay, and I need to check for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

First, I'll look for spelling mistakes. The text has several typos. For example, "convwniently" instead of "conveniently", "tonbe" instead of "to be", "vthinks" instead of "thinks", "ttpe" instead of "type", "vies" instead of "view", "dstablish" instead of "establish", "mas" instead of "as", "herenbecause" instead of "here because", "tyles" instead of "types", "tnaccentuate" instead of "to accentuate", "eaily" instead of "easily", "thab" instead of "than", "paws" instead of "paws", "ane" instead of "and", "thar" instead of "that", "agout" instead of "about", "spolication" instead of "speculation", "inrellectual" instead of "intellectual", "buns" instead of "buns", "mdear" instead of "m dear", "bun" instead of "buns", "buns" again, "buns" again, "mdear" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again, "buns" again. There are quite a few spelling errors that are distracting.

Next, grammar and syntax. The text has some awkward sentence structures. For example, "It will lead into my subject most convwniently to contrast and separate two divergent types of mind..." The structure here is a bit convoluted. Also, there are missing articles and prepositions. For instance, "The former type one might speak of as the legal or submissive type of mind..." The sentence structure is passive and could be clearer. There are also some run-on sentences that could be broken up for better readability.

Word choice and phrasing. The text uses some archaic or overly complex words that might be confusing. For example, "reap the consequences of the past" is clear, but some phrases are more obtuse. Also, there's inconsistency in terminology, like "the future" vs. "the future's" which might not be consistently capitalized or possessive.

Punctuation. The text has some missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, in "The former type one might speak of as the legal or submissive type of mind, because the business, the practice, and the training of a lawyer dispose him toward it..." the commas are used correctly, but there are instances where semicolons or periods might be more appropriate. Also, some sentences end with a dash without a period, which is a bit jarring.

Now, moving on to coherence. The essay is about contrasting two types of minds regarding the past and future. The structure is logical, with each paragraph building on the previous one. However, there are some abrupt transitions and shifts in focus. For example, the essay starts with the two types of mind, then moves into historical examples, then into scientific inquiry, and finally into philosophical musings. While the overall structure is coherent, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. Additionally, some ideas are introduced and then not fully developed, which can confuse the reader. For instance, the discussion of positivists and Comte is a bit sudden and might not be clearly connected to the main argument. Also, the conclusion is somewhat disjointed, jumping from scientific predictions to philosophical musings without clear transitions.

Another coherence issue is the use of examples. The text references historical figures and events (e.g., Plantagenet and Lancastrian England, South Africa war), but some of these examples are not clearly explained, which might make it hard for readers unfamiliar with the context to follow. Additionally, the essay sometimes digresses into tangential points, such as the comparison of sand grains and human behavior, which, while interesting, might not be directly tied to the main argument.

There's also a problem with repetition. The essay reiterates the contrast between the two types of mind multiple times, which can become redundant. While repetition can reinforce a point, in this case, it might make the text feel verbose and less engaging.

In terms of logical flow, the essay does present a clear argument but sometimes the supporting points are not well-structured. For example, the discussion of the inductive past and future is complex and could be clearer with better signposting of the argument's direction.

Overall, while the essay has a coherent structure and clear main argument, the fluency issues and some coherence problems affect the readability and clarity.

- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences (e.g., "But a very large amount of this floating uncertainty about these important matters is due to the fact that with most of us these two insufficiently distinguished ways of looking at things are not only present together, but in actual conflict in our minds, in unsuspected conflict; we pass from one to the other heedlessly...")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation (e.g., sentences ending with dashes without periods).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifting from legal/creative mind types to historical wars without clear links).  
- [LOGIC] Underdeveloped examples (e.g., references to "Plantagenet and Lancastrian England" lack context for clarity).  
- [CLARITY] Redundant repetition of the mind-type contrast, reducing engagement.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden digressions (e.g., sand-grain analogy) not clearly tied to main argument.  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed conclusion blending scientific prediction and philosophical musings without clear progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
