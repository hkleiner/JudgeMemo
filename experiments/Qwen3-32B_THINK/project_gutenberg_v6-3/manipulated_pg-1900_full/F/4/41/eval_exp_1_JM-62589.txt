Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of this text. Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I notice several spelling errors. For example, "Plymoufh" instead of "Plymouth", "ajd" instead of "and", and "Okd" instead of "Old". These are clear typos that would disrupt the reading flow.

Next, there are issues with syntax and word order. Phrases like "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence" feel awkward. The structure is confusing and not very natural.

There are also instances of incorrect word usage. For example, "thou wilt be turned on the town" – "turned on" doesn't make sense here; it should probably be "turned out". Another example is "It was no great thing for Debby to clamber from her bedroom window to the ground below." The phrase "no great thing" is used incorrectly here, as it's meant to convey it was easy, but the context suggests it's a significant action.

Punctuation issues include missing commas and incorrect use of quotation marks. For example, "‘See, lass,’ said the woman, ‘there lies thy father quite drunk. Look at thyself; in rags thou art, and shamefully neglected.’" The semicolon here doesn't fit well; a comma would be more appropriate.

There are also some missing or incorrect punctuation marks in dialogue tags, like "‘But I tell thee, child, he hath joined this wild crew who are headed for Boston, and thou wilt be turned on the town.’" The dialogue tag is missing a comma before "child".

Some sentences are run-on or lack proper conjunctions. For example, "Debby stared in bewilderment, then slowly the truth dawned upon her." This should be split into two sentences for clarity.

Overall, while the text is mostly readable, these issues with spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation affect the fluency. However, the errors are not so frequent that the text becomes difficult to understand.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, logical progression, transitions between ideas, and consistency.

The story has a clear structure with chapters, but some transitions between chapters are abrupt. For example, the shift from Debby's backstory to her transformation into Molly is handled, but there are moments where the narrative jumps without clear transitions.

There are instances of repetitive information. For example, Debby's longing for her father and her transformation into Molly are mentioned multiple times, which can make the narrative feel redundant.

Some plot points are not clearly explained. The connection between Debby and Morley is a bit confusing. The revelation that Morley looks like Debby and their intertwined fates is a key plot point, but the build-up and explanation could be clearer.

The ending wraps up several plot threads, but the connection between Debby's past and her future is a bit rushed. The resolution with her mother and the British mother is touched upon but could have been more detailed for better coherence.

The story maintains a consistent narrative voice and setting, which helps with coherence. The characters' motivations are generally clear, though some internal conflicts could be better developed.

Overall, the story is coherent with a logical progression, but there are areas where transitions and explanations could be improved to enhance the overall flow and clarity.
