Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll look at fluency issues:
- [SPELLING] There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "ith" instead of "is", "tarnsfer" instead of "transfer", "wsll" instead of "well", "brokest" instead of "brokest" (though that might be intentional for dialect), "croupier" instead of "croupier", and many others.
- [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect punctuation, incorrect verb forms, and incorrect sentence structure.
- [LEXICON] There are instances of incorrect word choice, such as "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain", "thurrender" instead of "surrender", and other misspelled words that don't match the intended meaning.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward or incorrect syntax, making them difficult to understand.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation, such as missing commas, incorrect quotation marks, and inconsistent capitalization.
- [TYPOGRAPHY] There are typographical errors, such as missing letters, extra letters, and incorrect letter substitution.

Now, for coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] The story has some logical inconsistencies, particularly in the hyper-space travel concepts and the timelessness of the hyper-space world.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is a bit disjointed in some places, with some scenes feeling abrupt or disconnected.
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are unclear, particularly the scientific and philosophical concepts about proto-man and hyper-space.
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between scenes or ideas.
- [CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT] Some characters are underdeveloped or inconsistent in their behavior.
- [PLOT HOLE] There are some plot holes, such as how characters move between locations without clear explanation.

Let me now rate the fluency and coherence of the text.

For fluency, the text has numerous spelling and grammar errors throughout, with some sections being quite difficult to read due to these errors. The text contains enough errors that they would distract a reader and sometimes affect comprehension. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale - the text is generally readable but has significant issues that interrupt the flow and clarity.

For coherence, the story has a clear narrative structure with a beginning, middle, and end. The characters and plot are generally consistent, and the story has a logical progression. However, there are some confusing elements, particularly with the scientific concepts, and some abrupt transitions between scenes. The philosophical and scientific ideas are complex and sometimes unclear. I would rate this as a 3.5 on the coherence scale - the text is generally coherent but has noticeable issues with logic and clarity in some parts.

Let me now write my final evaluation.
