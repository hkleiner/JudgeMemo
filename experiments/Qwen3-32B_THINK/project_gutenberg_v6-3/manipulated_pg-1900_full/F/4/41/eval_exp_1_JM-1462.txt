Let me analyze the text carefully for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:
First, I'll go through the text looking for problems related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1) Spelling errors:
- "tp" instead of "to"
- "illustrqtion" instead of "illustration"
- "aide" instead of "side"
- "oldbwoman" instead of "old woman"

- "wigh" instead of "with"
- "fotgotten" instead of "forgotten"
- "lutfle" instead of "little"
- "mis" instead of "is"
- "bottoe" instead of "bottom"
- "wilk" instead of "will"
- "formcoming" instead of "for coming"
- "you can’t of course remember" - "of course" is correct, but "you can't" is a contraction that should be "you cannot"
- "qnd" instead of "and"
- "of a night" - missing article
- "cand" instead of "and"
- "ljke" instead of "like"
