Let me analyze this text according to the evaluation criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand the text content. This appears to be an essay about "bookmen" - individuals who love books and literature. The author discusses what defines a true bookman versus someone who just owns many books, shares anecdotes about bookmen, and reflects on the passion for reading and collecting books.

Now, let's evaluate the text for fluency and coherence:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1) Spelling errors: There are several instances of misspelled words like "bpokman" instead of "bookman", "lurchase" instead of "purchase", "desore" instead of "desire", "cpstly" instead of "costly", "n" at the end of some sentences, etc.
2) Typos and missing letters: Words are missing letters or have extra letters, like "v" instead of "w" in "would ve", "t" instead of "th" in "It would ve like", "c" instead of "co" in "cost Â£80 if it cost a penny", etc.
3) Punctuation issues: There are several places where punctuation is missing or misplaced, such as the "n" at the end of sentences instead of a period, missing commas, and inconsistent quotation mark usage.
4) Awkward phrasing: Some sentences have awkward word order or phrasing that makes them less smooth, like "as he was to preside at a lecture I was deliveringmhe had in his courtesy invited me to dinner" (the "m" appears to be a typo).
5) Inconsistent capitalization: Some words are capitalized inappropriately, like "All the Year Round" when it appears to be a title that should be in italics.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1) Logical flow: The text jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it sometimes difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
2) Organization: The essay is long and covers many different topics (anecdotes about bookmen, different literary works, the nature of book collecting, etc.) without a clear structure or organization.
3) Repetition: The text sometimes repeats ideas or concepts without adding new information.
4) Disconnected ideas: Some paragraphs or sections appear disconnected from the main theme or from each other.
5) Ambiguity: Some phrases are ambiguous or could be interpreted in multiple ways, which affects the clarity of the text.

Based on these observations, I'll now rate the text for fluency and coherence.

For fluency: The text has numerous spelling errors, typos, and punctuation issues that affect readability. While the content is generally understandable, the frequent errors would distract a reader and make the text seem careless. I would rate this a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence: The text is long and covers many topics, but it does maintain a central theme about bookmen and their relationship with books. There are some logical jumps and disconnected ideas, but the overall message is clear. The essay does have a beginning, middle, and end, and the author returns to the central theme throughout. I would rate this a 3.5 on the coherence scale.
