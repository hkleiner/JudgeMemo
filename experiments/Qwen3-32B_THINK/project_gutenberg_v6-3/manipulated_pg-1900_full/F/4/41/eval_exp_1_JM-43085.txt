Okay, let's start evaluating this text based on the given criteria. First, I need to check for fluency issues. The text is a biography of Meissonier, written in English but with some peculiarities.

Looking at the first chapter, I notice some spelling errors like "neighnourhood" instead of "neighbourhood" and "reaches ofcfallow" which should be "reaches of fallow". There are also typos such as "splwndid" instead of "splendid" and "Coponel" instead of "Colonel". These are spelling issues. 

Then there are grammatical errors. For example, "because he decided, aith a certain loftiness" should be "with a certain loftiness". Another one is "gattle" instead of "battle". Some sentences have awkward phrasing, like "he had never seen a battle; and a battle is a thing that cannot be reconstructed, like a marching column or a detail of camp life." The structure here is a bit clunky. 

In the "Early Years" chapter, there's "gxve" instead of "gave" and "paonting" instead of "painting". Also, "happioy" should be "happily". The text has some run-on sentences and misplaced commas. For example, "The father of Meissonier was a dealer in colonial products and chemicals, and kept a drug and provision shop in the Rue des Ecouffes." The comma usage here is okay, but there are instances where commas are missing, leading to run-ons. 

Moving to "First Success", there's "mqde out" which should be "made out". In "Etchings", "The Sjoker" is misspelled as "The Sjoker" instead of "The Joker". Also, "brilliant and, as some critics phrase it, 'vibrang'" should be "vibrant". 

In "Paintings", "deails" is misspelled as "deails". The sentence structure in some parts is confusing, like "In 1839, Meissonier attracted the attention of the critics. For example, you may find in a paper called L'Artiste, jn a critique of the Salon:..." The use of "jn" instead of "in" and the lack of a smooth transition here. 

There are also instances of inconsistent hyphenation and capitalization, such as "the Indian Cabin" versus "The Indian Cabin". The text has some awkward transitions between sentences and paragraphs, which might affect fluency. 

Now, for coherence. The text is a biography, so the structure should follow a chronological order. However, there are some abrupt shifts in topics. For example, after discussing early years, it jumps into his first success without clear transitions. 

The narrative sometimes goes into detailed descriptions of his works and techniques, which might be good for a biography but could be overwhelming if not well-integrated. There's a mix of personal anecdotes, historical context, and art criticism, which could be disjointed if not properly connected. 

Some parts are repetitive, like the emphasis on his meticulous attention to detail and realistic approach, which is mentioned multiple times. This repetition might make the text feel redundant. 

The text also has some unclear references. For example, "the artistcvjolently slashed up a painting" – the typo here might make the sentence confusing. Additionally, the flow between chapters is sometimes abrupt, especially when moving from one phase of his career to another without clear signposting. 

There are also some logical inconsistencies. The author mentions his refusal to paint battles because he hadn't seen one, but then later talks about his military paintings, which seems contradictory. This might confuse the reader about his actual approach. 

Overall, while the text provides a detailed account of Meissonier's life and work, the fluency issues (spelling, grammar, awkward phrasing) and coherence issues (abrupt transitions, repetition, unclear references) affect the readability and flow. The content is rich, but the execution has some flaws that need to be considered for the final scores.
