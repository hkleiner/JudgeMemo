Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence according to the specified criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues.

Starting with fluency, I'll look for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or any issues that make the text hard to read. The text is a biography of François Boucher, a French painter. I notice some words are misspelled, like "witneas" instead of "witness," "jnked quill" instead of "inked," "knlwing" instead of "knowing," and "futger" instead of "further." There are also some missing or incorrect punctuation marks. For example, "whilst the tipstaff to the king's palace, one François Prévost, signed solemnly as witneas to the birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid morsel of humanity..." has a missing comma after "one François Prévost." These are all spelling and grammar issues that affect fluency.

Looking at coherence, I need to assess how well the narrative flows and if the ideas are logically connected. The text is a chronological biography, so it should follow a clear timeline. I notice some abrupt transitions between events in Boucher's life. For example, the transition from his early life to his education under Lemoyne is somewhat abrupt. Also, there are some disjointed sentences and paragraphs that don't clearly connect to the previous or next section. For instance, "The child, indeed, was bkrn into a Paris agog with stirring affairs." The word "bkrn" is a typo for "born," but more importantly, the sentence about Paris being agog with stirring affairs seems to be an aside that doesn't smoothly connect to the previous or next paragraph.

There are also some unclear or confusing phrases. For example, "The gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather Prévost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of things?" This sentence is confusing in structure and doesn't clearly convey its meaning. Similarly, "He had the virtue of recognising his mediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of mediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling with pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art and in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to the studio of Lemoyne..." This is a long, complex sentence that could be broken down for better clarity.

Some sections also jump in time without clear transitions. For example, the text moves from Boucher's early life to his education under Lemoyne without a smooth transition. Additionally, there are some repeated phrases or ideas that could be streamlined for better coherence. For instance, the text mentions Boucher's work with Lemoyne multiple times in quick succession, which could be consolidated for better flow.

Overall, the text has a good structure as a biography, but there are several fluency and coherence issues that need to be addressed. The fluency issues include spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and awkward phrasing. The coherence issues involve abrupt transitions, unclear sentences, and some disjointed ideas.

For the final scores, I would rate fluency as a 3 because there are multiple grammatical and spelling errors that interrupt the flow. Coherence is a 3 as well because while the narrative is generally logical, there are noticeable abrupt transitions and some confusing sections that affect the overall coherence.
