Alright, let me start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence.

First, for fluency. The text is a narrative with a lot of descriptive language. I need to check for grammatical errors, syntax issues, spelling, and word choice. 

Looking at the text, I notice some verb tense inconsistencies. For example, "the shadows was long" should be "were long." Also, "they had traversed more than half the entire length" has a redundant phrase. There are also some awkward phrasings like "I had learned that World Fellowship was not alone an intellectual concept." The word "alone" is misplaced here. 

Another issue is the use of "mighted" instead of "might have" in "he mighted carry the ladies." There are also some missing commas and incorrect prepositions, like "by the middle of the month brown-green orchids had pushed out to the light" – "pushed out to" might be better as "pushed out into." Additionally, some sentences are run-on or have poor structure, making them hard to follow. 

Now for coherence. The story is about Kuei Ping's life, but I need to check if the narrative flows logically. The text is divided into sections with headings like "Wherein there is a departure from family custom..." which help structure the narrative. However, some transitions between these sections are abrupt. For example, the shift from the wedding to the departure is sudden without much foreshadowing. 

There are also some inconsistencies in the timeline. For instance, Kuei Ping's marriage and subsequent events are detailed, but the time jumps between sections can be confusing. Additionally, some characters' motivations are not clearly explained. Why does Kuei Ping decide to leave? The internal conflict is mentioned, but the reasoning isn't fully developed. 

The narrative also includes some subplots that aren't fully resolved. For example, the mention of Fuh Tang's illness and opium use is introduced but not thoroughly explored. The ending with the narrator becoming a pupil is a nice touch, but it's a bit abrupt and might leave some questions unanswered. 

Overall, the text has a clear structure with the headings, but the transitions between sections and the development of some subplots could be smoother. The language is rich, but the fluency issues do affect readability.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense ("the shadows was long" → "were long").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("I had learned that World Fellowship was not alone an intellectual concept").  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors ("the chairs were carried" → "were being carried").  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect word usage ("mighted" instead of "might have").  
- [SYNTAX] Redundant phrasing ("the entire length of the street").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences ("the house servant who walked ahead, breaking a way through the crowded Big Horse Street").  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous word choice ("the coming alliance with an official family was not beyond the knowledge of Wong Lui").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between narrative sections (e.g., from the wedding to the departure from family custom).  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline (e.g., sudden time jumps between Kuei Ping’s marriage and her later life).  
- [CLARITY] Underdeveloped character motivations (e.g., Kuei Ping’s decision to leave her family is implied but not fully explained).  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between subplots (e.g., Fuh Tang’s illness and opium use introduced but not resolved).  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly reliant on repetitive headings ("Wherein...") without sufficient narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
