Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll identify fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The Legend of Healing is, that anyone, Brave or Squaw, if ill, would quickly be restored")
- [GRAMMAR] Improper use of commas and punctuation (e.g., "If this Legend is based on fact, it would certainly have made the locality a famous place of annual rendezvous; and at such a rendezvous the opportunities for the exchange of many and varied commodities--'trade'--would surely not have been neglected.")
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "It is possible to-day, as it most certainly was in those traditional days")
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spelling (e.g., "Onguiaahras", "Onguiaahra", "Onguiaahra")
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Niagara" vs "niagara")
- [SPELLING] Use of British English spellings in a text that appears to be written in American English (e.g., "colour", "realise")
- [SYNTAX] Wordy and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It was unquestionably a Frenchman who first, through pale-face eyes, saw the great Cataract; and it was later than 1608, the year when the ancient City of Quebec was founded, and white men first settled in the northern part of this Continent.")
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent use of terms (e.g., "Cataract" vs "Waterfall" vs "Falls")
- [PUNCTUATION] Improper use of em dashes and ellipses
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of past and past perfect tenses
- [GRAMMAR] Improper use of prepositions (e.g., "The first printed direct mention of Niagara referred to its famous Portage.")
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent use of hyphens and capitalization in compound words (e.g., "white man", "white men", "White man")
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and punctuation within them
- [GRAMMAR] Improper use of passive voice in places where active voice would be clearer
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of articles (e.g., "the Cataract" vs "a Cataract")

Now for coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient evidence or explanation (e.g., the author asserts that certain legends are "based on fact" without providing supporting evidence)
- [LOGIC] Some logical connections are weak or missing (e.g., the text makes claims about the significance of Niagara as a trade center but doesn't consistently support this with evidence throughout)
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraphing and organization, making it difficult to follow the main points
- [CLARITY] The text uses complex, archaic language that can be difficult to understand (e.g., "It is probably to the latter class--modern traditions--even with all their plausibilities, based upon the superstitious and stoical nature of the Aborigines--that several of the best-known Legends concerning Niagara belong.")
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains many digressions and tangents that don't clearly relate to the main topic
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory information (e.g., claiming that certain legends are based on fact while also suggesting they may be fabrications)
- [CLARITY] The author uses overly complex sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the meaning
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without establishing their relevance to the main topic
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information in a non-chronological or non-logical order
- [CLARITY] The text uses inconsistent terminology (e.g., "Aborigines" vs "Indians" vs "Savages")
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear sectioning or labeling to help the reader follow the structure
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes assumptions without providing evidence (e.g., assuming that certain legends are based on fact without supporting evidence)

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

Fluency Score:
The text has numerous grammatical errors, inconsistent verb tenses, and complex sentence structures that make it difficult to read. The inconsistent capitalization and use of British English spellings also contribute to the lack of fluency. However, the text is generally readable and the main ideas can be understood despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2.5.

Coherence Score:
The text has significant coherence issues. It jumps between topics, has weak logical connections, and lacks clear organization and structure. While the main topic of Niagara as an Aboriginal Center of Trade is clear, the text often digresses and presents information in a non-logical order. The author also makes claims without sufficient evidence or explanation. I would rate this as a 2.5.
