**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from one scene to another without clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] The sudden revelation of Herold's past as a thief seems abrupt and unforeshadowed.
3. [CLARITY] The relationship between Marche and Herold is initially unclear.
4. [LOGIC] The sudden change in Marche's attitude toward Herold seems abrupt without sufficient explanation.
5. [STRUCTURE] The story has a somewhat episodic structure that could be more tightly woven.
6. [CLARITY] The emotional development between Marche and Molly is rapid and could benefit from more gradual buildup.
7. [LOGIC] The sudden reconciliation between Marche and Herold feels rushed.
8. [CLARITY] The final resolution feels somewhat abrupt and could benefit from more development.

Based on these issues:

**Fluency Score:** There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. While the overall narrative is still understandable, these errors do distract from the reading experience. I would rate this as a 2.5.

**Coherence Score:** The story has a clear narrative arc, but there are some abrupt transitions and developments. The emotional and plot developments feel somewhat rushed in places. I would rate this as a 3.
