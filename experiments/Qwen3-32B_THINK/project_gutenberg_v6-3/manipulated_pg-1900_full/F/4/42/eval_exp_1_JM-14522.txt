Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. I need to check for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice and punctuation.

First, I'll go through the text paragraph by paragraph. The first paragraph seems fine, but I notice "tell" is used instead of "told." That's a tense error. Then there's "you was certainly very natural," which should be "you were." 

Next, "A few weeks after this, the purchase is concluded," uses present tense where it should be past. Later, "he had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scoured the floor" has an issue with the verb formâ€”should be "scouring." 

In the second chapter, "had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried up-stairs." The phrase "carried up-stairs" is a bit awkward. In the third chapter, "He had wear it with great success" should be "worn." 

In the fourth chapter, "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement..." The semicolon and the structure here are a bit confusing. 

Moving to the fifth chapter, "He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of the yellowing trees flew through the air" uses "flew" instead of "flying." 

In the sixth chapter, "The carp-pond had been dragged" is a bit awkward. Also, "gipsies had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair" uses "mistaken" where it should be "mistaken the date." 

In the seventh chapter, "you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead..." The sentence is a bit long and complex, making it a bit hard to follow.

For coherence, I'll check the logical flow, transitions, and consistency. The story is a ghost story, so the progression is generally good. However, there are some places where the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, in the first chapter, the sudden shift from the Otises' arrival to the blood-stain incident is abrupt. 

In the second chapter, the return of the blood-stain is introduced without much build-up, which might confuse readers. In the third chapter, the twins' behavior is mentioned, but their role in the story isn't clearly established. 

In the fourth chapter, the ghost's attempts to scare the family are described in detail, but the connection between his actions and the family's responses isn't always clear. 

In the fifth chapter, Virginia's interaction with the ghost is a pivotal moment, but the transition from her curiosity to her decision to help the ghost is a bit abrupt. 

In the sixth chapter, the search for Virginia is detailed, but the sudden appearance of the ghost's skeleton is a bit jarring. 

In the seventh chapter, the resolution of the ghost's story is handled well, but the transition to the wedding and the final conversation between Virginia and her husband is a bit rushed.

Overall, the text is quite fluent and coherent, with only minor issues that don't significantly impact the readability or understanding. The story flows well, and the narrative is clear. There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases, but they are not frequent enough to lower the fluency score much. For coherence, the logical progression and transitions are mostly good, though there are a few places where smoother transitions would enhance the narrative.
