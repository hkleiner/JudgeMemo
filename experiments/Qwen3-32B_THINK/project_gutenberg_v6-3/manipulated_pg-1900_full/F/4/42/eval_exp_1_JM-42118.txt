Alright, let's take a look at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence using the specified criteria and scales. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me read through the text carefully.

First, I notice that the text is quite long and has a lot of complex sentences. There are some grammatical errors. For example, in the sentence "he was to was allowed to follow his bent," the verb is repeated incorrectly. Also, there are instances of incorrect verb tenses, like "Boucher was give a studio" should be "was given." 

Spelling issues include "am" instead of "are" in "The Pompadour am beginning to speak..." and "wased" instead of "was allowed." There are also some missing articles and prepositions, such as "the high promenades of Grasse" should be "the high promenades of Grasse" (though maybe that's correct), but "he was to was allowed" is definitely a problem. 

In terms of syntax and phrasing, some sentences are awkwardly constructed. For example, "The nations, weary of war, agree to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748." The subject-verb agreement is off; "nations" is plural, so "agreed" would be correct. 

Looking at coherence, the text tells a story about Fragonard's life and the historical context. The narrative generally flows from one chapter to the next, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the switch from discussing Fragonard's early life to the political gossip in Grasse might be a bit jarring. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "the Pompadour am beginning to speak..." is confusing because "am" is a verb used with "I," but here it's referring to the Pompadour. The text might benefit from more explicit connections between ideas to ensure the reader follows the flow.

Additionally, the text includes a lot of historical context, which is relevant but sometimes feels inserted without a smooth transition. The reader might get lost in the details of political events without a clear connection back to Fragonard's life. 

Overall, the fluency has several issues that make reading a bit challenging, but the coherence is generally maintained with some minor issues in transitions and clarity. I'll need to score these based on the provided scales.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "Boucher was give a studio," "he was to was allowed").  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "am" instead of "are" (e.g., "The Pompadour am beginning to speak...").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "he was to was allowed to follow his bent").

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between Fragonard’s personal life and unrelated political gossip (e.g., "Gossip of high politics came trickling down...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive explanations of historical events with little connection to Fragonard’s narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "the Pompadour am beginning to speak..." lacks context).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from "Rome" to "The Du Barry" without clear linkage).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
