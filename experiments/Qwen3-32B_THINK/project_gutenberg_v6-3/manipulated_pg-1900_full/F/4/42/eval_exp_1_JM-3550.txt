Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I need to look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text is a novel excerpt, so it's quite long and complex.

Looking at the first few paragraphs, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "THE Pyreneean valley" should probably be "The Pyrenean valley" with a lowercase 'T' and correct spelling of 'Pyrenean'. There's also "they cannot compete with the mountain scenery of other tourists-love regions in Europe" – "tourists-love" should be "tourist-loved" or "tourist-loved regions". 

Another issue is the use of "was not close pressed together with overhanging rocks" – the correct form should be "were not closely pressed together". There's also a sentence that ends with a comma instead of a period, like "And there were those who thought that there was occasionally ground for complaint in the conduct even of Madame Bauche." The comma at the end is incorrect.

In the section about La Mère Bauche, there's a run-on sentence that's hard to follow. Also, the phrase "He or she who complained might leave the place at a moment’s notice if it so pleased them." uses "them" after "He or she", which is a pronoun agreement issue. 

Looking further, there are instances of incorrect verb tenses. For example, "He had am sent to Paris" should be "He had been sent to Paris". Also, "she had am very angry" is incorrect; it should be "she was very angry". 

There's also a sentence that says "And in these walks it was not always thought pleasant to meet her." The structure is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity. 

In the section about Adolphe, there's a sentence: "He had am sent to Paris to see something of the world, and learn to talk French instead of the patois of his valley; and having left Paris had come down south into Languedoc, and remain there picking up some agricultural lore which it was thought might prove useful in the valley farms of Vernet." The verb "remain" should be "remained" for past tense consistency. 

Another example is "But since then she had thoroughly done the duty of a mother by the little girl, who had become the pet of the whole establishment, the favourite plaything of Adolphe Bauche, and at last of course his early sweetheart." The phrase "at last of course" is a bit awkward and could be smoother. 

There are also instances of incorrect prepositions. For example, "He had am sent to Paris" should be "He had been sent to Paris". 

Looking at the coherence, the story is about La Mère Bauche and her family, and the relationship between her son Adolphe and Marie. The narrative is linear, but there are some abrupt shifts in time and perspective. For example, the story starts by setting up the setting and then moves into the history of the family, which could be a bit jarring. 

There are also some unclear transitions. For instance, the text jumps from describing the hotel to the character of La Mère Bauche without a smooth transition. Additionally, the motivations of some characters are not fully explained, making it hard to understand their actions. 

The ending is a bit abrupt, with the death of La Mère Bauche and the fate of the other characters not being fully resolved. This could leave the reader feeling unsatisfied. 

There are also some inconsistencies in character behavior. For example, La Mère Bauche is portrayed as strict and stern, but later she shows some tenderness towards Marie, which is not well-explained. 

The dialogue is sometimes stilted, which can make the interactions between characters feel unnatural. For example, the conversations between La Mère Bauche and the capitaine are formal and lack the natural flow of real dialogue. 

Overall, the text has a number of fluency issues that would distract a reader, but the coherence is somewhat affected by abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. However, the story is still readable and the main plot points are clear.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "He had am sent to Paris" → "He had been sent to Paris").  
- [GRAMMAR] Pronoun agreement errors (e.g., "He or she who complained might leave the place... them").  
- [GRAMMAR] Misused prepositions (e.g., "close pressed together" → "closely pressed together").  
- [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "Pyreneean" → "Pyrenean", "peregrinations" → "peregrinations" is correct but contextually odd).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "And in these walks it was not always thought pleasant to meet her").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Sentence fragments/incorrect punctuation (e.g., "And there were those who thought... them." ends with a comma).  
- [LEXICON] Misused words (e.g., "tourists-love regions" → "tourist-loved regions").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts in narrative focus (e.g., from setting description to character backstory without transition).  
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear cause-effect relationships (e.g., motivations for La Mère Bauche’s actions are underexplained).  
- [CLARITY] Inconsistent character behavior (e.g., La Mère Bauche’s sudden tenderness toward Marie lacks context).  
- [TRANSITION] Jarring time jumps (e.g., "two years before the date of this story" with no smooth setup).  
- [LOGIC] Underdeveloped plot resolution (e.g., Marie’s fate at the end is unresolved and abrupt).
