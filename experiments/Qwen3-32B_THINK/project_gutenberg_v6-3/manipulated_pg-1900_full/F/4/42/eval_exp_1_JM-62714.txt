Let me carefully analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll identify fluency issues:

1) Grammar issues:
- "did seem too bad to kept them" (should be "to keep them")
- "they am all grown up" (should be "they are all grown up")
- "learn in Play-time" (should be "learned in Play-time")
- "inquire Dinah" (should be "inquired Dinah")
- "coulded invite" (should be "could invite")
- "in name hebben" (should be "in name of heaven")
- "reply Mr. Delight" (should be "replied Mr. Delight")
- "pull the door together" (should be "pull the door shut" or similar)
- "agree Mr. Delight" (should be "agreed Mr. Delight")
- "paint snow-white inside" (should be "painted snow-white inside")
- "It is $15,000, but it is very well-built and—" (should be "It is $15,000, but it is very well-built and—")
- "wasn’t to be so awful pleased" (should be "wasn’t so awful pleased")
- "had to made" (should be "had to make")
- "could was a little girl" (should be "could be a little girl")

2) Spelling issues:
- "dustign-time" (should be "dusting-time")
- "spelled" (repeated word in "spelled spelled")
- "had to made" (should be "had to make")
- "had to be made" (should be "had to make")
- "had to made" (repeated issue)
- "had to be made" (repeated issue)

3) Syntax issues:
- "had to be made" (passive voice when active is better)
- "had to be made" (repeated issue)
- "had to made" (repeated issue)
- "had to be made" (repeated issue)

4) Lexicon issues:
- "had to be made" (repeated issue)
- "had to made" (repeated issue)
- "had to be made" (repeated issue)

Now, I'll identify coherence issues:

1) Logical flow issues:
- The story has an overall good flow, but there are some abrupt transitions between scenes
- Some actions happen without clear cause-effect relationships
- The narrative jumps between different locations and activities without clear transitions

2) Structural issues:
- The text is a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but some chapters feel disconnected from each other
- There are some inconsistencies in the narrative structure, particularly with how Betsey's dollhouse evolves over time

3) Clarity issues:
- Some sentences are ambiguous or unclear
- The motivations for some actions are not clearly explained
- The relationships between characters are not always clearly established

4) Transition issues:
- Some paragraphs transition smoothly, but others feel abrupt
- The connections between different parts of the story could be clearer in some places

Based on these observations, I'll now rate the text on both fluency and coherence.

For fluency:
The text has multiple grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and syntax issues. There are repeated issues with verb forms (particularly "had to be made" and "had to made"). The text is generally readable but has enough errors to distract from the overall experience. I would rate this as a 3 on the fluency scale.

For coherence:
The story has a clear narrative with a logical progression. The characters and their relationships are generally clear. However, there are some abrupt transitions and occasional inconsistencies in the narrative structure. The text is generally coherent but has some issues that affect the reading experience. I would rate this as a 4 on the coherence scale.
