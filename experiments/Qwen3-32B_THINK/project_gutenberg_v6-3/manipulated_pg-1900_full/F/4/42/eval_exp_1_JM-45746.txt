Okay, let's start evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. First, I need to go through the text carefully and identify any issues that might affect fluency. Fluency issues usually relate to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, in the line "It would have make me unpopular..." the verb form should be "made" instead of "make". There's also "He had know years before" which should be "known". These are [GRAMMAR] issues. 

Next, there's "the superintendent forgot to tell us anything about the building equipment before he left for his vacation." The word "equipment" is plural here, but it should be singular since it's referring to the building's equipment collectively. That's a [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example is "The desks were changed immediately and the 'teacher problem' in this room was solved." The article "the" before "teacher problem" is unnecessary, so that's a [LEXICON] issue. 

I also see some spelling errors like "have was offered" where "was" is incorrect. That's a [SPELLING] issue. 

In terms of coherence, the text is a narrative about becoming a teacher and managing a school. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced and if there are any abrupt shifts. 

One coherence issue is that the text jumps between different anecdotes and examples without clear transitions. For instance, moving from the first man's experience to the second without a smooth connection. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue. 

There's also a lack of clear progression in some parts. For example, the discussion about the janitor and then suddenly moving to school activities without linking them. That's a [LOGIC] issue. 

The text sometimes introduces new ideas that aren't fully explained or resolved, leading to confusion. For example, the part about the janitor facing the desks toward the windows is mentioned but not elaborated on. That's a [CLARITY] issue. 

I should also check for repetition. The text mentions the importance of preparation and experience for teachers multiple times, which might be a [REPETITION] issue. 

Overall, the fluency issues are primarily grammatical and syntactical, while coherence issues involve structure and logical flow. The text is generally readable but has some problems that could be improved.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "It would have make me unpopular" (should be "made")
- [GRAMMAR] "He had know years before" (should be "known")
- [SYNTAX] "the building equipment" (singular vs. plural misuse)
- [LEXICON] "the 'teacher problem'" (unnecessary article)
- [SPELLING] "have was offered" (incorrect verb form)
- [SPELLING] "wased" (incorrect verb form)
- [SYNTAX] "the superintendent forgot to tell us anything about the building equipment before he left for his vacation" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "I had not seen the janitor, and proceeded to air the office, dust the chairs and desk" (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between anecdotes (e.g., from the janitor's experience to the superintendent's meeting)
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas between chapters (e.g., moving from janitor's role to school activities without clear linkage)
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "the 'teacher problem'" without prior explanation)
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of themes (e.g., teacher preparation and experience mentioned multiple times without progression)
- [LOGIC] Illogical sequencing (e.g., discussing janitor's duties then suddenly moving to student activities)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous connections between examples and main points (e.g., the janitor's desk arrangement example not clearly tied to the teaching profession theme)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5 
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
