Alright, let's analyze the given text to assess fluency and coherence.

First, I'll go through the text and identify any fluency issues, which relate to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Some observations:
1) There are several instances of incorrect verb conjugations:
   - "you woulded profit" should be "you would profit"
   - "I could not agree with your opinions regarding Germany's responsibility for the war, nor regarding her methods of conducting the war; and it did not seem to me that you woulded profit by any statement I might make..."
   - "you could hardly be expected to write with that scientific accuracy and care which would, in normal times, be your ideal."
   - "To one such name was added at our last commencement the degree representing one of the highest honours..."
   - "Any attempt on the part of our Government to dictate the policy of any newspaper would was hotly resented..."
   - "It did not alter the situation to said that censorship and suppression was necessary..."
   - "Every issue of your papers must was submitted to your police..."
   - "Whatever else may be said against the American press, it must was admitted that it is free from Government control."
   - "If there am any truth in the assertion that the Allies were trying to force war on Germany..."
   - "Americans believe that the German people are a great people, capable of great and good things. They honour and admire the Germany which finds her best expression in the literature..."
   - "The American people was praying earnestly for Allied victory."

2) There are issues with word choice and phrasing:
   - "Toed pit the races, nations, religions, and classes against one another."
   - "I realised that some of our papers are a disgrace to the high calling of journalism; I believed that some sacrifice honour for gain..."
   - "Your letters clearly showed that you wrote under the influence of an intense emotion--an emotion which I can both understood and respect..."
   - "I believe also that in a calmer time you would not entertain the sweeping opinion that 'the daily press has become one of the direst plagues of humanity, an ulcer in the frame of society, whose one object it is, for private ends (wealth, political influence, and social position), toed pit the races, nations, religions, and classes against one another.'"
   - "The roll of American journalists is honoured by the presence of many names which command respect at home and abroad because of a long-standing reputation for honesty, fearlessness, and distinguished service in the cause of humanity."
   - "Your own letters, particularly the long one of July 9, were read most carefully. I appreciate your earnest endeavour to convince me of the righteousness of your country's cause..."

3) There are issues with sentence structure and flow:
   - Some sentences are very long and complex, making them difficult to follow.
   - There are some awkward transitions between ideas.
   - Some phrases are redundant or unnecessarily wordy.

Now, I'll analyze the coherence of the text. Coherence relates to how well the ideas are connected, how logical the progression is, and how well the narrative is structured.

1) The text is a long letter with a clear purpose: to explain American public opinion toward Germany and the reasons for it.
2) The structure is generally logical, with the author outlining the background of American opinion before the war, then explaining the sources of information after the war began, and finally stating what American opinion is regarding the war.
3) However, there are some coherence issues:
   - The text jumps between different topics and perspectives without clear transitions.
   - Some paragraphs are very long and cover multiple points, making it difficult to follow the main idea.
   - The author frequently shifts between personal anecdotes, general statements about Americans, and specific historical events.
   - Some arguments are repeated or restated without clear progression.
   - The tone shifts between formal and somewhat emotional at times.

Let me now assign scores based on these observations.

For fluency:
The text has several grammatical errors, particularly with verb conjugations and some awkward phrasing. However, the overall message is still understandable, and the errors don't completely disrupt the reading experience. I would rate this as a 3.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence:
The text has a general structure, but the flow between ideas is sometimes awkward. The author covers a lot of ground, and some paragraphs are quite long and dense. The transitions between different topics could be improved, and some ideas are repeated without clear progression. I would rate this as a 3.5 on the coherence scale.
