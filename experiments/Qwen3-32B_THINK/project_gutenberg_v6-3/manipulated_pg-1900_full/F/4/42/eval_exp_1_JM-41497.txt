Alright, I need to assess the fluency and coherence of this text. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues.

First, for fluency, I'm looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation errors. The text is quite long, so I'll scan for any obvious issues. 

I notice some grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph: "that nothing save a long series of mishaps can kept them from the goal of their ambition." The verb should be "keep" instead of "kept" because it's following "can". Another example: "he is said to had remarked" should be "he is said to have remarked". 

There are also some awkward phrasings. For instance, "the painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." The phrase "come into touch" is a bit awkward; "come into contact" would be better. Also, "will probably stimulate" is a bit off because the masterpieces are past events, so "will" should be "would".

Spelling errors are minimal, but I notice a few. For example, "Reynolds have a supreme facility" should be "Reynolds had a supreme facility". Another one: "He take no visible part in the intrigue" should be "He took no visible part in the intrigue".

Punctuation issues include missing commas where needed. For example, in the sentence "He was apprenticed in London to Thomas Hudson, a portrait painter of the day and a Devon man too." A comma should be after "too" to separate the clauses.

For coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the text is well-structured. The text is a biography of Reynolds, so it should follow a chronological or thematic structure. 

I notice some abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For example, the transition from discussing Reynolds' early life to his Italian journey is a bit sudden. Also, some paragraphs jump between different topics without clear connections. For instance, after discussing Reynolds' travels in Italy, the text suddenly shifts to his return to England and his career there without a smooth transition.

There are also some unclear references. For example, "Sir Walter Armstrong thinks that one of his copies of a Rembrandt is classed among the originals in the National Gallery to-day!" The pronoun "his" could be ambiguous here, making it unclear whose copies are being referred to.

Some parts of the text are repetitive. For example, the discussion of Reynolds' deafness is mentioned multiple times in different contexts without adding new information each time. This can disrupt the flow and make the text feel redundant.

The conclusion in Chapter IV is a bit abrupt and doesn't tie back to the earlier chapters as effectively as it could. The final paragraph summarizes Reynolds' contributions but doesn't provide a strong closing argument that ties all the points together.

Overall, the text is well-structured in terms of being a biography, but there are some issues with transitions and clarity that affect coherence. The fluency issues, while not overwhelming, do include several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that could be distracting to a reader.
