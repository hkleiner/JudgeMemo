Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency issues. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "The skeletons that have been exhume indicate..." should be "exhumed". That's a past participle error. There are also some subject-verb agreement issues, like "The wives of the settlers... do not take a similar precaution" – "do" should be "did" to match the past tense context. 

Punctuation is mostly okay, but there are some run-on sentences that could be split for clarity. Also, some phrases are awkward, like "being but a few feet above the sea" – maybe "being only a few feet above sea level" would be smoother. There are instances of missing commas, like after introductory phrases, which could make the sentences clearer.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a historical narrative, so it should have a clear progression. The chapters are well-organized by topics, but there are some transitions between paragraphs that feel abrupt. For example, moving from the description of geography to the first white visitor without a clear transition might confuse readers.

Some parts jump between time periods without clear indicators. For example, the chapter on George Rogers Clark starts with his first trip, then moves to his second appearance, but the connection isn't always smooth. Also, there are some repetitive points, like the mention of Daniel Boone's role in settlement locations appearing in multiple chapters without clear links.

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "the first battle of the Revolutionary War is fought at Lexington, Mass." should be "was fought" for consistency. Also, the text mentions "The Transylvania Land Company" but doesn't clearly explain its role until later, which could be confusing.

Overall, the text is well-structured with clear chapters, but some transitions and references need improvement. Fluency issues are mostly minor but add up, while coherence issues are about logical flow and clarity in references.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "have been exhume" → "exhumed", "was now joined" → "were now joined").  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The wives... do not take" → "did not take").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "being but a few feet above the sea" → "being only a few feet above sea level").  
- [SPELLING] Missing prepositions (e.g., "to the South Sea" → "to the South Sea *which* they then thought").  
- [LEXICON] Misused words (e.g., "was am said" → "was said", "was make" → "was made").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., shifting from geography to settlers’ arrival without context).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear cause-effect relationships (e.g., "The alarm was quickly sent to the surrounding forts" lacks explanation of how).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the first battle of the Revolutionary War is fought at Lexington, Mass." → "was fought" for tense consistency).  
- [TRANSITION] Repetitive ideas across chapters (e.g., Daniel Boone’s role in settlements repeated without new context).  
- [STRUCTURE] Overlapping time periods with unclear chronology (e.g., blending events from the Revolution and post-war eras without markers).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
