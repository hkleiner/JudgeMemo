Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors or issues with syntax.

I notice some spelling errors: "saw it" should be "shouldn't see it" (but I need to check the context). There's also "sedsed nothing" which should be "said nothing". "It was Mr. Deedy who had am owner" – "am" is incorrect here, it should be "as". "I could account for my continuity but on the supposition that I had been cheap." – this sentence structure is a bit awkward. "I rather resented the practice of fathering all flatness on my late protector" – "flatness" might not be the right word here. "I had enjoyed his visible search for the obscure suburb I seemed to had named." – "had named" should be "had named". "Mr. Pinhorn effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness with which I had meet Miss Braby" – "had meet" should be "had met". "I had succeeded better than I wished" – this is a bit confusing. "A few days later I called on Lord Crouchley and carried off in triumph the most unintelligible statement that have yet appear" – "have yet appear" should be "had yet appeared". "I’ve always thought his sudden alertness a remarkable example of the journalistic instinct." – this sentence is okay. "Nothing had occurred, since I first spoke to him, to create a visible urgency, and no enlightenment could possibly have reached him." – this is a bit long and could be clearer. "It was a pure case of profession flair" – "profession" should be "professional". "He had smell the coming glory" – "smell" should be "scented". 

Now for coherence: The story is a narrative about a journalist's experiences with a writer, Neil Paraday. The flow of the story is generally logical. There are transitions between chapters that maintain the narrative. However, there are some places where the connections between ideas are a bit abrupt. For example, the transition from the journalist's personal change of heart to the specific details about Neil Paraday's book might be a bit jarring. Some sections jump from one scene to another without clear transitions, like from the journalist's thoughts to Mr. Pinhorn's actions. The overall structure is coherent, but there are moments where the progression of events could be smoother. The ending is a bit abrupt, with the loss of the manuscript being a significant plot point that isn't fully resolved. 

Based on these observations, I would rate fluency as 4. There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but the text is generally readable. Coherence is a bit lower at 3.5, as the narrative is mostly logical but has some abrupt transitions and unclear connections in certain parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was Mr. Deedy who had am owner" (incorrect "am" instead of "as").  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had enjoyed his visible search... I seemed to had named" (incorrect "had named" instead of "had named").  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had meet Miss Braby" (incorrect "had meet" instead of "had met").  
- [GRAMMAR] "that have yet appear" (incorrect "have yet appear" instead of "had yet appeared").  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had smell the coming glory" (incorrect "smell" instead of "scented").  
- [SPELLING] "saw it" (context implies "shouldn’t see it").  
- [SPELLING] "sedsed nothing" (incorrect "sedsed" instead of "said").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "I could account for my continuity but on the supposition that I had been cheap."  
- [LEXICON] "flatness" used in "fathering all flatness" is vague and potentially incorrect.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between the journalist’s internal monologue and external events (e.g., from Mr. Pinhorn’s actions to Neil Paraday’s illness).  
- [LOGIC] Unclear transitions between chapters (e.g., Chapter II’s abrupt focus on the journalist’s moral conflict without sufficient setup).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the manuscript" in Chapter X is mentioned without earlier context).  
- [TRANSITION] Jarring shifts in narrative perspective (e.g., from the journalist’s experience to abstract reflections on fame).  
- [LOGIC] The ending abruptly concludes with the loss of the manuscript, leaving unresolved tension.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
