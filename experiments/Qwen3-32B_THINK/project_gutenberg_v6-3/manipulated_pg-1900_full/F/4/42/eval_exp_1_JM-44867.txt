Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria. Let me start by understanding the definitions and scales for each metric.

**Fluency** focuses on the readability of individual sentences, including grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. A score of 5 is highly fluent with minimal errors, while a 1 is largely unintelligible.

**Coherence** is about how the text as a whole flows logically, with ideas connected smoothly and a clear progression. A 5 is highly coherent, while a 1 is incoherent with disjointed ideas.

Now, let's look at the text. It's a philosophical essay discussing two types of minds (past-oriented vs. future-oriented) and the possibility of scientifically predicting the future. The text is quite long and dense with complex ideas and arguments.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **Grammar**: There are several grammatical errors. For example, "types which was to be distinguish" should be "types which were to be distinguished." "The former type one might speak of as the legal or submissive type of mind, because the business, the practice, and the training of a lawyer dispose him toward it; he of all men must constantly refer to the law made" – this sentence is awkwardly structured.
   
2. **Spelling**: The word "foresee" is used where "foreseeable" might be more appropriate. There are also instances like "dealt" instead of "dealing" and "waded" instead of "wandered."

3. **Syntax**: Some sentences are overly complex and hard to follow. For example, "And the question arises how far this absolute ignorance of the future is a fixed and necessary condition of human life, and how far some application of intellectual methods may not attenuate even if it does not absolutely set aside the veil between ourselves and things to come." This sentence is long and convoluted.

4. **Word Choice**: There are instances of awkward word choices. For example, "we do this with disastrous results to our confidence and to our consistency in dealt with all sorts of things" – "dealt" should be "dealing."

5. **Punctuation**: Some sentences lack proper punctuation, making them hard to parse. For example, "The legal mind would say, 'they who break the law at any point break it altogether,' while the creative mind would say, 'let the dead past bury its dead.'" The first part is missing a comma after "say."

6. **Tense**: There are inconsistencies in verb tenses. For example, "The great mass of people do so to-day. It is written, they say. 'Thou shalt not steal,' for example--that is the sole, complete, sufficient reason why you should not steal, and even to-day there is a strong aversion to admit that there is any relation between the actual consequences of acts and the imperatives of right and wrong." The shift from present to past tense is confusing.

7. **Redundancy**: Some phrases are redundant, such as "the present is no more than material for the future, for the thing that is yet destined to be." The repetition of "for" is unnecessary.

8. **Clarity**: Some phrases are unclear. For example, "the smaller the overplus of evil consequences the more most of us would vacillate." The term "overplus" is not commonly used and may be confusing.

9. **Phrasing**: There are awkward phrasings, such as "the man of science comes to believe at last that the events of the year A.D. 4000 are as fixed, settled, and unchangeable as the events of the year 1600." The placement of "A.D." is awkward.

10. **Conjunctions**: Some sentences use conjunctions incorrectly. For example, "It is into the future we go, to-morrow is the eventful thing for us." The conjunction "into" is awkward here.

### Coherence Issues:
1. **Structure**: The text is structured in a logical manner, discussing the two types of minds, their implications, and the possibility of predicting the future. However, the dense and complex nature of the content makes it challenging to follow.

2. **Logic**: The arguments are logically presented, with clear cause and effect. The author builds a case for the possibility of scientific prediction of the future by discussing past scientific discoveries and their implications.

3. **Transitions**: The transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, with the author often using phrases like "But before pointing out how divergent these two types or habits of mind really are..." to connect ideas.

4. **Clarity**: Some sections are less clear due to the complexity of the ideas and the dense writing style. For example, the discussion of the positivists and their limitations is somewhat confusing.

5. **Repetition**: There is some repetition of ideas, particularly in the discussion of the two types of minds and the implications of scientific prediction.

6. **Abstraction**: The text is highly abstract and philosophical, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the arguments.

7. **Consistency**: The author maintains a consistent focus on the two types of minds and the possibility of predicting the future, which contributes to the overall coherence.

8. **Flow**: The flow of ideas is generally smooth, with the author building on previous points and introducing new ideas in a logical sequence.

9. **Focus**: The text maintains a clear focus throughout, with the author consistently returning to the central theme of the two types of minds and the possibility of scientific prediction.

10. **Conclusion**: The conclusion ties together the main points, reinforcing the idea that human destiny is not final and that there is a great future ahead.

### Fluency Score:
The text has several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and complex sentences that make it less fluent. However, it is still generally readable and the ideas are clear despite these issues. I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The errors are noticeable but do not completely disrupt the readability.

### Coherence Score:
The text is highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression of ideas. The arguments are well-structured and the author maintains a consistent focus throughout. Despite the complexity of the content, the text flows smoothly and the ideas are connected logically. I would rate the coherence as a 4.5. There are a few areas where the dense writing makes it challenging to follow, but overall the text is very coherent.
