Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of this text. First, I'll look for grammatical errors. The text is quite long, so I need to scan through it for any issues.

I notice some verb tense problems. For example, "we should not be what we are" seems off. Also, "we should not be working-class women agitators who base their demands on the ground of a Socialist demand" – the structure here is a bit confusing. 

There are some subject-verb agreement issues. Like "The middle-class women’s agitation movement still demands Woman Suffrage to-day as a natural right" – the subject is singular, but the verb is plural. 

Preposition usage might be incorrect. For example, "the suffrage for women so as to brought it before the public" – "brought" should be "bring" after "so as to." 

Punctuation issues: Missing commas in complex sentences. For example, "We take our stand from the point of view that the demand for Woman Suffrage is in the first place a direct consequence of the capitalist method of production." A comma after "view" would help. 

Word choice: "we should was clear that we are on the right lines" – "was" should be "be." Also, "we should not be what we are" is awkward. 

Repetition: The phrase "Woman Suffrage" is repeated frequently, which might be stylistic but could be a minor issue in fluency. 

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a political speech discussing Woman Suffrage from a Social-Democratic perspective. The structure is logical, but I need to check for coherence in the flow of ideas.

The speech starts with the decision to discuss Woman Suffrage at a Congress, then moves into historical context, compares middle-class vs. Social-Democratic views, provides statistics, and concludes with resolutions. The flow is mostly logical, but some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. 

There are some abrupt shifts in topics. For example, after discussing historical movements, the text jumps to statistics without a clear transition. 

Some parts are repetitive, such as the repeated emphasis on the difference between middle-class and working-class women's suffrage demands. This could be intentional for emphasis but might affect coherence. 

The conclusion is clear, summarizing the resolution and the importance of Woman Suffrage. However, some arguments are presented without sufficient explanation, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context. 

Overall, the coherence is strong, but there are minor issues with transitions and some repetition. The fluency has several grammatical and structural issues that could affect readability.
