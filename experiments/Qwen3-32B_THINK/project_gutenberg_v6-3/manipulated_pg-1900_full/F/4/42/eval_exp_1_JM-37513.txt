Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Analysis:
Looking for issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

- [GRAMMAR] "I is still in my teens" - incorrect subject-verb agreement
- [GRAMMAR] "was rendered clearer and more extensive" - missing article ("more extensive" should be "more extensive one")
- [GRAMMAR] "I knew but little" - awkward phrasing, should be "knew little"
- [GRAMMAR] "to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "you stand face to face" - should be "face to face" (not a problem, but worth noting)
- [GRAMMAR] "the human mind itself--emotion, intellect and all their phenomena" - missing comma after "emotion"
- [GRAMMAR] "he inquired whether I had not learnt from Sartor Resartus" - "learnt" is British English, which is acceptable but inconsistent with the rest of the text
- [GRAMMAR] "I must left to some future Herbert Spencer lecturer" - incorrect tense (should be "leave")
- [GRAMMAR] "I would fain left it altogether" - incorrect tense (should be "leave")
- [GRAMMAR] "we have not by any means done with the former when we turn from the First Part to the Second" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "In how many senses he uses the word 'force' I am not prepared to say" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "force is used in wellnigh every conceivable sense of this ambiguous word" - missing comma after "word"
- [GRAMMAR] "we are baffled by mystery; let us, therefore, make the best of it and rejoice" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "I must beg leave to assume, without discussion" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "the question: But what evolves the evolved?" - missing comma after "question"
- [GRAMMAR] "the terms in which an answer must be given are incommensurable with the concepts with which science has elected to carry on its business as interpreter of nature" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "the persistence of some Cause which transcends our knowledge and conception" - inconsistent capitalization
- [GRAMMAR] "Now the reference in each case under (2) is to the nature or constitution of that within which some process occurs" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "These was of course merely suggestions" - incorrect verb form
- [GRAMMAR] "One could wished that Spencer could have thought out some such distinctions" - incorrect tense
- [GRAMMAR] "But what one asks, and asks of him in vain, is just how, within a connected scheme" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "There remains for consideration the place of the cognitive relation in Spencer's philosophy of science" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "We have seen that Spencer believed that the task of psychology is to investigate the correlation of external and internal relations" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "the question itself is vague" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "If we are speaking of direct awareness, apparently not" - awkward phrasing
- [GRAMMAR] "The essential point to bear in mind is that the cognitive relation always involves relatedness of many terms" - awkward phrasing

## Coherence Analysis:
Looking for issues with logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure.

- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different philosophical concepts without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] The text frequently introduces new ideas without properly establishing their connection to the previous discussion
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient context or background information
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces complex philosophical concepts without first explaining simpler concepts
- [LOGIC] The text often presents multiple philosophical positions without clearly distinguishing between them
- [LOGIC] The text frequently shifts between discussing Spencer's work, Bergson's criticisms, and general philosophical concepts without clear markers
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin with "But" or "However" without properly connecting to the previous paragraph
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces a new topic without signaling the shift
- [LOGIC] The text frequently references previous works and authors without providing enough context for the reader
- [LOGIC] The text is often repetitive, discussing similar concepts in different sections without clear organization
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces a concept and then doesn't return to it, creating disjointedness
- [LOGIC] The text often discusses abstract philosophical concepts without grounding them in concrete examples
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents a conclusion without adequately supporting it with the preceding arguments
- [LOGIC] The text frequently uses complex philosophical terminology without defining it
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new ideas in the middle of a paragraph without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] The text is highly abstract and can be difficult to follow without background knowledge of the specific philosophical concepts being discussed

Now, I'll rate the text on fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Score:
The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent verb tenses. These issues do not completely prevent understanding but make reading more difficult. The text is academic and philosophical in nature, which allows for some complexity, but the errors are frequent and noticeable.

I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale. The text is generally readable but contains enough grammatical issues and awkward phrasing that comprehension is sometimes difficult without effort.

## Coherence Score:
The text is very dense and complex, discussing abstract philosophical concepts. It jumps between different ideas and authors without always providing clear transitions. The logical sequencing is often difficult to follow, especially for readers without background knowledge of the specific philosophical concepts being discussed.

The text is well-structured in its overall approach to discussing Spencer's philosophy, but the execution is often disjointed. The frequent shifts between discussing Spencer, Bergson, and general philosophical concepts without clear markers create coherence issues.

I would rate this as a 2.5 on the coherence scale. The text has a general structure but contains frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing that make the overall coherence difficult to follow without extra effort.
