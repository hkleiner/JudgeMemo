Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smooth and natural the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice that might disrupt the flow.

Looking at the text, I notice a few potential issues. First, there are some grammatical errors. For example, "His contentment is to had the flowers laid out in open beds" - the phrase "to had" is incorrect; it should be "to have." Another example is "It had seem to me as if certain old friends looked out from their prison with appealing glance" - the verb "had seem" is incorrect; it should be "had seemed." 

There are also some awkward phrasing issues. For example, "He is proud to be a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement" - the phrase "witness to perfection" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity. Another example is "He is not above considering the art of cooking potatoes or the question of whether human beings once had tails" - this sentence feels a bit disjointed and could be smoother.

Word choice issues include "He is not above considering the art of cooking potatoes" - "art" here might not be the best word choice, as it refers to the skill or technique of cooking, but it's not incorrect. Another example is "He is proud to be a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement" - the use of "witness to perfection" is a bit unusual and could be clearer.

Punctuation issues are also present. For example, "It is said, and now I am going to turn the application of a pleasant anecdote upside down, that a Colonial squatter having made his pile and bethinking himself of his soul, wrote home to an old friend to send him out some chests of books, as many as he thought fit, and the best that he could find." This sentence is quite long and could benefit from a comma or a period to break it up for better readability.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and organization of the text. I need to check if the ideas are connected smoothly, if there are any abrupt shifts, and if the narrative is clear and consistent.

The text is a long essay about bookmen and their love for books. The structure is mostly logical, with the author discussing various aspects of bookmen, their habits, their preferences, and their relationship with literature. However, there are a few points where the flow could be improved. For example, the transition from discussing the Colonial squatter anecdote to the discussion of the bushman's literary knowledge is a bit abrupt. Another example is the shift from discussing the bookman's collection of books to the discussion of his relationship with his wife and the struggle with bibliomania - this could be smoother.

There are also some instances where the ideas are a bit disjointed. For example, the discussion of the bookman's love for detective stories and Sherlock Holmes is followed by a discussion of his ability to distinguish between books that come and go and those that remain - this could be better connected to the previous topic.

Overall, the text is well-structured and the ideas are generally connected, but there are a few places where the flow could be improved for better coherence.

For the fluency score, the text is mostly fluent, but there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that could be improved. I would give a score of 4, as the issues are minor and do not significantly disrupt the overall readability.

For the coherence score, the text is mostly coherent, but there are a few places where the flow could be smoother. I would give a score of 4 as well, as the issues are not major and the overall structure is logical.
