Alright, let me analyze the provided text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, for **Fluency Issues**:
- I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation problems.
- There are several instances of incorrect verb forms, like "have committed" instead of "had committed".
- There are also spelling errors such as "thith" instead of "this", "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain", and "ecthra-planetarieth" instead of "extra-planetaries".
- Some sentences have awkward phrasing or word order, such as "He was fair of skin and had hair the color of copper" could be "He had fair skin and copper-colored hair".
- There are also issues with past tense consistency, like "he have been born" instead of "he had been born" or "he was born".
- Some sentences are run-on and lack proper punctuation, making them hard to follow.

Now, for **Coherence Issues**:
- I need to assess the logical flow, structure, and clarity of the narrative.
- The story has some logical inconsistencies. For example, the concept of "hyper-space" and the scientific explanations provided are complex and may not be clearly explained to the reader.
- The narrative jumps between different characters and locations without smooth transitions.
- Some plot points are introduced without sufficient context or explanation, such as the concept of "planetarization" and the significance of "proto-man".
- The ending is somewhat abrupt and leaves many questions unanswered, which may affect the overall coherence of the story.
- The scientific concepts are introduced in a way that may confuse the reader, especially if they are not familiar with the genre.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the text for both fluency and coherence.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "he have been born" instead of "he had been born")
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors (e.g., "thith" instead of "this", "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and word order (e.g., "He was fair of skin and had hair the color of copper")
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent word choice (e.g., "he have been born" instead of "he was born")
- [PUNCTUATION] Run-on sentences and missing punctuation
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "he is not an Earthman" instead of "he is not an Earthman")
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect past tense usage (e.g., "he have been born" instead of "he had been born")
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect modal verb usage (e.g., "you will was to find" instead of "you will have to find")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Confusing scientific explanations of hyper-space and proto-man concepts
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative perspective and time
- [CLARITY] Underdeveloped concepts (e.g., planetarization, the significance of titanium)
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent character motivations (e.g., Margot's sudden interest in proto-man)
- [LOGIC] Confusing timeline of events and character interactions
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes and locations
- [CLARITY] Unclear relationships between characters and events
