Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria and scales. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues.

First, for fluency, I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. I notice some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, "have am found" should be "has found" or "has been found." There are also instances where the subject-verb agreement is incorrect, like "The bier is decorated" when it should be "The bier was decorated." Additionally, some sentences have run-on constructions or awkward word order that affects readability.

Next, for coherence, I need to check the logical flow and structure of the text. The text seems to present a coherent narrative about Anna Seward and the Lichfield literary circle. However, there are some abrupt transitions between topics, such as moving from one historical figure to another without clear connections. Some sections might be repetitive or lack smooth transitions, which can make the reading experience a bit disjointed at times.

I'll now list the specific issues under each category with their labels and then assign the final scores based on the scales provided.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "have am found" (should be "has found" or "has been found").  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is the aim of this book to resuscitate interest... and in the literary circle over which she reigned supreme" (awkward phrasing).

- [GRAMMAR] "Honora was very beautiful and accomplished, and have attracted many admirers" (subject-verb agreement error).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The bier is decorated with garlands and flowers" (tense inconsistency; should be "was decorated").
