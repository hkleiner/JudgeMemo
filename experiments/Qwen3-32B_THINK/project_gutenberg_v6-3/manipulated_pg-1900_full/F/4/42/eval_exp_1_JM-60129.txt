Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues

I'll go through the text and identify any problems with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. Spelling issues:
   - "t'a" appears multiple times but should be "ta"
   - "ol" appears instead of "of" (e.g., "the outlines ol which could be discerned")
   - "am" appears instead of "are" (e.g., "sparsely cover by grass")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The lamas, on their arrival, appeared somewhat surprised at our intrusion but though the first meeting was rather cool, the ice soon was broken...")
   - "am" appears instead of "are" (e.g., "which are sold in Hsuchow")
   - "coulded" instead of "could"
   - "to was" instead of "to was"
   - "corresponding" instead of "corresponding"
   - "conple" instead of "couple"
   - "t's" instead of "ts"
   - "ki" instead of "ki"
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The words which I have noted and phonetically transcribed as heard among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs, are to be found in a table at the end of this brochure.")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The number of deaths still outnumber the births.")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "A few cows were see")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The live stock I saw, was good of its kind")
   - "am" appears instead of "are" (e.g., "There am seven or eight lamas")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "There am forty kilometres eastward from Machuangtzu lies a village")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The words which I have noted and phonetically transcribed as heard among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs, are to be found in a table at the end of this brochure.")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The words which I have noted and phonetically transcribed as heard among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs, are to be found in a table at the end of this brochure.")
   - "was" appears instead of "were" (e.g., "The words which I have noted and phonetically transcribed as heard among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs, are to be found in a table at the end of this brochure.")

2. Grammar issues:
   - Subject-verb agreement problems (e.g., "There am seven or eight lamas")
   - Verb tense issues (e.g., "I was obliged to remain a conple of days")
   - Missing articles (e.g., "the Chinese town Chin-t'a")
   - Improper use of prepositions (e.g., "the outlines ol which could be discerned")
   - Sentence fragments (e.g., "In cases of death, a lama is called upon to read prayers.")
   - Misplaced modifiers (e.g., "The chief room in the house was provided with the traditional Chinese sleeping stove, k'ang, covered with a straw matting...")
   - Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "The bride and bridegroom are not allowed to see each other before marriage.")
   - Awkward phrasing (e.g., "The greater part of my equipment, among other things my instruments for anthropological measurements, had followed the main high road, by some mistake, passed me and was probably awaiting me in Kanchow.")

3. Syntax issues:
   - Run-on sentences with missing punctuation
   - Overly complex sentences that are hard to follow
   - Awkward sentence structures

4. Punctuation issues:
   - Missing commas
   - Missing periods
   - Incorrect use of hyphens
   - Missing quotation marks for direct speech
   - Missing colons for lists

5. Lexical issues:
   - Inconsistent terminology (e.g., using "Yögur" and "Yögurs" interchangeably)
   - Missing or inconsistent capitalization
   - Inconsistent use of numbers (mixing out-of-words and in-words)
   - Inconsistent use of units (mixing "km" with spelled-out "kilometres")

# Coherence Issues

I'll analyze the text for logical flow, transitions, and overall structure.

1. Structure issues:
   - The text is a detailed ethnographic study with a logical structure, but there are some inconsistencies in how information is presented.
   - Some sections jump between topics without clear transitions.
   - The text has a table at the end with data that isn't clearly referenced throughout the text.
   - There are some inconsistencies in how information is organized across the two chapters.

2. Logical flow issues:
   - Some paragraphs seem disconnected from the main narrative.
   - There are some abrupt shifts in focus within paragraphs.
   - The text occasionally goes into very detailed descriptions that seem out of proportion to the overall narrative.

3. Transition issues:
   - Some paragraphs begin without clear transitions from the previous one.
   - The text lacks some connecting phrases that would help the reader follow the logical flow.

4. Overall coherence:
   - Despite the issues mentioned, the text maintains a clear focus on describing the Yögur people and their culture.
   - The two chapters (about the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs) are well-structured and coherent within themselves.
   - The text provides a detailed and consistent description of the same subject matter throughout.

Based on my analysis, I'll rate the fluency and coherence of the text.

For fluency, the text has numerous spelling and grammar issues that would distract a reader, especially the consistent use of "was" instead of "were" and "am" instead of "are". These are significant issues that affect readability. However, the text is generally understandable despite these problems.

For coherence, the text maintains a logical structure and clear focus on its subject matter. The two chapters are well-organized and the information is presented in a coherent manner, despite some occasional jumps in focus.

Now I'll provide the final ratings:
