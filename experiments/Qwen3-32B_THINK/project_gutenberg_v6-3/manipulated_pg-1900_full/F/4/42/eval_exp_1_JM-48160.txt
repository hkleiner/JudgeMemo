Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. 

**Fluency Issues:**
First, I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice problems. The text is a long article with several chapters. I notice some spelling errors like "Quatier" instead of "Quartier" and "euphenism" instead of "euphemism." There are also missing articles or prepositions, such as "the Marquise d’Andigné (who was Miss Goddard of Providence)" where "the" is missing before "President." Some sentences have incorrect verb forms, like "they am chatting" instead of "they are chatting." Additionally, there are a few instances of incorrect word usage, such as "taubes" instead of "taubes" (though that might be intentional as a term of endearment for German planes), and "sde" instead of "side." The overall grammar seems mostly correct, but these errors, while not too frequent, do occur and can distract the reader.

**Coherence Issues:**
Next, I'll check the logical flow and structure. The text is a series of chapters detailing the author's experiences in the war zone. The structure is chronological, which helps with coherence. However, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, the shift from describing a hotel to the author's experiences in another town can be jarring. There's also some repetition in the narrative, such as the author mentioning her determination to visit certain places multiple times. The narrative sometimes jumps between different locations and events without clear transitions, which might confuse the reader. The overall theme is consistent, but some sections could be better connected to maintain a smooth progression.

**Final Scores:**
For fluency, the text has several minor errors but is generally readable. The errors don't severely impact understanding, so a score of 4 is appropriate. For coherence, while the structure is logical, the abrupt transitions and some repetition affect the flow. A score of 3.5 seems fitting as it's generally coherent but with noticeable issues.
