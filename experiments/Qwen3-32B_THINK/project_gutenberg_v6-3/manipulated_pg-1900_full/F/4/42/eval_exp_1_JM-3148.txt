Let me analyze the text to evaluate it for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors throughout the text, such as "was" instead of "were", "have" instead of "has", and "cossed" instead of "crossed".

2. [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "he woulded have been there", "he coulded still make many parts", "the sun is just dropping behind Brigadier Hill" instead of "is just dropped"), incorrect pronoun usage, and sentence structure issues.

3. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly structured or have incorrect word order, such as "Anthony Croft had been the only son of his mother, and she a widow." which should be "Anthony Croft had been the only son of his mother, and she was a widow."

4. [PUNCTUATION] There are punctuation issues, such as missing commas and periods in some places, and inconsistent use of quotation marks.

5. [LEXICON] There are some instances where words are used in a way that doesn't make sense in context.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] There are some logical inconsistencies, such as references to events that don't quite make sense in sequence or context.

2. [STRUCTURE] While the overall narrative is generally coherent, there are some places where the flow of the story could be improved.

3. [CLARITY] Some passages could be clearer, particularly when describing complex ideas or emotions.

4. [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs or ideas are abrupt or could be smoother.

Let me now provide a more detailed analysis with specific examples:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [SPELLING] "He coulded still make many parts of violins" (should be "could still")
- [SPELLING] "Anthony Croft have been the only son" (should be "had been")
- [SPELLING] "He had said to him once, "Miss Butterfield is very beautiful, isn't she, Davy?" (should be "He had said to him once, "Miss Butterfield is very beautiful, isn't she, Davy?"")
- [GRAMMAR] "I feel that the secret of everything in the world that is beautiful, or true, or terrible, is hidden in the strings of my violin" (should be "are hidden")
- [GRAMMAR] "He could never study when a fly buzzed on the window-pane" (should be "He could never study when a fly was buzzing on the window-pane")
- [GRAMMAR] "There was no spirit in Edgewood bold enough to conceive" (should be "There was no spirit in Edgewood bold enough to conceive")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in several places, such as "Anthony Croft had been the only son of his mother, and she a widow."
- [PUNCTUATION] Quotation marks are inconsistently used and sometimes not properly closed.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] Some references to past events or character motivations are not clearly explained.
- [STRUCTURE] The story moves through several chapters, and while it's generally well-structured, some transitions between scenes could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions could be clearer, particularly when conveying complex emotions or abstract concepts.
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin abruptly without clear connection to the previous one.

Based on my analysis, I would rate the text as follows:

**Fluency Score:** 3 (Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.)

**Coherence Score:** 4 (Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.)

The text is a well-written story with a clear narrative, but it contains several fluency issues that would benefit from proofreading and editing.
