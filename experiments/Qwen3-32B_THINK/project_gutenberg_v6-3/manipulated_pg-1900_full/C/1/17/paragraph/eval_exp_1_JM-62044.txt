Alright, let me start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence according to the given criteria. 

First, fluency. The text is quite long and complex, with a lot of varied vocabulary and sentence structures. I'll need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. 

Looking through the text, I notice a few instances of potential grammatical issues. For example, in the sentence "The squirrel also eats fungi of some sorts, particularly the red kind," the use of "sorts" is correct, but the phrasing could be smoother. Another example is "The body lay in state awhile in the Royal Academy, and was then taken to St. Paul's Cathedral," where "awhile" is correctly used, but the sentence structure is a bit formal and could be simplified for better flow. 

There are also some run-on sentences that might be difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence starting with "But the early experiences of my own life, gained in a country and under circumstances..." is quite long and could benefit from being split into shorter sentences. Additionally, some sentences use passive voice excessively, which can make the text feel less direct. 

In terms of coherence, the text is a narrative about the author's relationship with two squirrels, interspersed with philosophical reflections on animals and humanity. The main narrative flows well, but there are some abrupt shifts in topic. For example, the text transitions from discussing the squirrels' behavior to a philosophical discussion on religion and the Industrial Revolution, which might confuse readers. 

There are also some sections where the connection between ideas is unclear. For instance, the part about the caterpillar destroying trees after a discussion on squirrels seems out of place. Additionally, some paragraphs introduce new ideas without sufficient transition, making the overall structure feel a bit disjointed. 

Overall, the text is mostly fluent and coherent, but there are a few areas where improvements could be made to enhance readability and maintain a smooth narrative flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The squirrel also eats fungi of some sorts, particularly the red kind" – awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "The body lay in state awhile in the Royal Academy, and was then taken to St. Paul's Cathedral" – overly formal and wordy.  
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., "But the early experiences of my own life, gained in a country and under circumstances...") disrupt flow.  
- [PASSIVE VOICE] Excessive use of passive constructions (e.g., "The numerous expressions of pleasure at the reading of my history...") reduces directness.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from squirrel behavior to philosophical discussions on religion/industrialization.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition to caterpillar destruction after squirrel behavior (e.g., "But this is not done by squirrels. It is done by the caterpillar...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed paragraph introducing "Mildred rushed to him..." unrelated to squirrel narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between squirrel anecdotes and broader philosophical claims (e.g., "He who has felt it fully knows that it embraces all His creatures").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
