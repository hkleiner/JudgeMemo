Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:

1. **[SPELLING]** There are several spelling errors in the text:
   - "ith" instead of "is"
   - "thith" instead of "this"
   - "alwayth" instead of "always"
   - "thurrender" instead of "surrender"
   - "Ecthactly" instead of "Exactly"
   - "Thervith" instead of "Service"
   - "Tranthfer" instead of "Transfer"
   - "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain"
   - "ecthra-planetarieth" instead of "extra-planetaries"
   - "ethpect" instead of "expect"
   - "ecthra-planetarieth" again
   - "thtink" instead of "think"
   - "Evidently" is spelled correctly, but it's part of a run-on sentence

2. **[GRAMMAR]** There are numerous grammatical issues:
   - Missing or incorrect verb conjugations
   - Inconsistent subject-verb agreement
   - Incorrect word forms (e.g., "thith" instead of "this")
   - Misused prepositions
   - Run-on sentences
   - Missing articles and prepositions

3. **[SYNTAX]** The syntax is often awkward:
   - Sentence structure is frequently disrupted by the lisp sounds
   - Some sentences are run-on or have poor flow
   - The text has a strange mix of narrative and what appears to be unrelated passages (like the one about "Her appearance at the period of our tale")

4. **[LEXICON]** There are some questionable word choices:
   - Some words appear to be used incorrectly or out of context
   - Some phrases are awkward or unnatural in their phrasing
   - The text includes what appears to be unrelated passages that don't fit with the main narrative

5. **[PUNCTUATION]** There are punctuation issues:
   - Missing or incorrect commas
   - Missing quotation marks
   - Missing periods at the end of sentences
   - Inconsistent use of punctuation

## Coherence Issues:

1. **[LOGIC]** There are logical inconsistencies in the narrative:
   - The main story is interrupted by what appears to be unrelated passages (like the one about "Her appearance at the period of our tale")
   - Some plot elements don't make logical sense
   - There are unresolved plot points and unanswered questions

2. **[STRUCTURE]** The structure of the text is problematic:
   - The narrative is interrupted by what appear to be unrelated passages
   - The flow of the story is disrupted by these insertions
   - There are abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas

3. **[CLARITY]** There are clarity issues:
   - Some passages are confusing or difficult to understand
   - Some sentences are ambiguous or have multiple meanings
   - The text includes what appear to be historical or literary passages that don't clearly relate to the main narrative

4. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between scenes and ideas are often abrupt:
   - The text jumps from one scene to another without clear transitions
   - There are sudden shifts in perspective or narrative voice
   - The narrative is frequently interrupted by what appear to be unrelated passages

5. **[CONNECTION]** There are issues with connecting ideas and maintaining a consistent narrative:
   - Some plot elements are not clearly connected
   - Some character actions and motivations are not well explained
   - The narrative is frequently interrupted by what appear to be unrelated passages

Now let me assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

## Fluency Score:
The text has numerous spelling, grammar, syntax, and punctuation issues. These errors are frequent and often distract from reading and understanding the text. While the narrative itself is generally readable, the linguistic errors make it less fluent.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented.

Given the frequency and severity of the issues, I would rate this at 2.5 on the fluency scale.

## Coherence Score:
The text has significant coherence issues. The narrative is frequently interrupted by what appear to be unrelated passages. The logical flow of the story is disrupted, and there are abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas. While the main narrative is generally coherent, the numerous insertions make it less so.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent.

Given the numerous coherence issues and the way the narrative is disrupted, I would rate this at 2.5 on the coherence scale.

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested format.
