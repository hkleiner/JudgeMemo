I need to evaluate the given text on two criteria: Fluency and Coherence, using a 1-5 scale with half-points allowed. Let me carefully analyze the text.

## Fluency Evaluation

Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll look for issues like grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, incorrect word usage, and punctuation problems.

Looking at the text:
- There are some grammatical issues, such as "The charming novelettes in which the allegory is forgotten need no more justification" which is a bit awkward and unclear.
- Some sentences have awkward phrasing, like "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army, and three-four times all the forces mustered by the United States."
- There are a few instances of missing articles or prepositions, such as "the following attempt of the enemy to find a decision in France" should be "the following attempt by the enemy to find a decision in France."
- Some word choice seems off, like "the Russian Armies collapsed after months of intensive German and Bolshevist propaganda" - "Bolshevist" is an archaic term.
- There are a few instances of missing commas or incorrect punctuation, such as in the long sentence: "Russia's losses are more than twice those of France, four-five times those of England, and more than thirty-five times those of America."

Overall, the text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.

## Coherence Evaluation

Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, looking at logically sequenced ideas, non-repetitive content, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure.

Looking at the text:
- The text appears to be a historical analysis of Russia's role in World War I, but it jumps between different sections and topics without clear transitions.
- There are some unrelated passages that seem out of place, like the section about "Boucher" and the Utes and Comanches at the end.
- The text has multiple sections that appear to be cut off or incomplete, such as the section starting with "Again Opportunities for the Allies" which seems to be a repetition or misplaced section.
- There are some confusing references, like "this sonov" which likely should be "the sonov" or another word.
- The text occasionally repeats the same points or phrases.
- The structure is somewhat disjointed, with the author switching between different aspects of Russia's military contributions without a clear narrative thread.

The text is generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.

## Final Scores

Based on my analysis:
- Fluency Score: 3 - The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.
- Coherence Score: 3 - The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Now I'll format the response according to the instructions.
