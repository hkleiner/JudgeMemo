Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The text is a novel excerpt with a mix of narrative and dialogue. First, I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues.

Looking at the first paragraph: "The gulch ran in a trough of beauty to the foot of Jones's Hill, which rose in a sweeping curve into the clouds." The structure here is clear, but the phrase "trough of beauty" is a bit unusual. It's not a grammatical error, but maybe a bit awkward. 

Next, there's a section about Boucher and the Pompadour. The sentence structure is complex but still readable. "To set down Boucher's favor at Court to her is ridiculous." The verb "set down" is a bit old-fashioned, but it's acceptable in a literary context. 

The dialogue is interspersed with the narrative. For example: "The Lord our God Most High, He hath made the deep as dry, He hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the earth." The shift from third-person narrative to direct speech is handled well. 

There are some instances of inconsistent verb tenses or subject-verb agreement. For example: "He looked at the hollow of the gulch and cursed it manfully and bitterly." "Cursed" is past tense, which is correct. 

I notice some run-on sentences. For example: "Therefore Jim had sunk about fifty prospect holes; got colors under the grass-roots, as evidence that pay should be there--and nothing but ashy wash beneath it." The semicolon and em dash are used, but the sentence is a bit long. 

There are some awkward phrases like "the shades of pessimism gather fast and furious--more especially if a man does his own cooking, and the raw material is limited, at that." The use of "at that" at the end is a bit abrupt. 

In the dialogue, there are contractions like "He's" and "He's" which are appropriate. The use of "didn't" and "hadn't" is correct. 

There are some instances of missing commas in dialogue. For example: "Dearest Jim--And again I must say 'no.'" The em dash is used here, which is correct, but a comma might be more appropriate. 

I notice some inconsistencies in punctuation. For example, in the letter from Anne, there are some missing commas after introductory phrases. 

Overall, the text is mostly fluent. There are a few awkward phrases and some punctuation issues, but they don't significantly impact readability. 

Now for coherence. The story follows Jim's experiences in Sweet Briar Gulch and his interactions with various characters. The narrative flows from one scene to the next, with clear cause and effect. 

The transition between the narrative about Boucher and the Pompadour to Jim's current situation is a bit abrupt. It's not immediately clear how these two sections are connected. 

The letter from Anne is a significant part of the narrative. The transition from the external events to the internal thoughts and letter is handled well. 

There are some shifts in perspective, such as the sudden mention of historical figures and events, which might confuse the reader. For example, the section about Disraeli and the literature of social indignation seems a bit out of place in the middle of the narrative about Jim and Ches. 

The dialogue between Jim and Bud is coherent and contributes to the development of their relationship. The interactions between Jim and Ches also show progression in their bond. 

The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The resolution of the tunnel collapse and the arrival of help is well-handled. 

There are some minor inconsistencies in the timeline or character actions that could be confusing. For example, the sudden appearance of Bud and the miners' arrival is a bit abrupt but is explained through the narrative. 

Overall, the coherence is strong. The narrative is logically structured, with clear transitions and a consistent flow of events. The few abrupt shifts or inconsistencies are minor and don't significantly impact the overall coherence.

For the fluency score, there are some awkward phrases and punctuation issues, but they are not frequent enough to lower the score too much. I'd say a 4.5. 

For coherence, the narrative is well-structured with clear transitions. The few abrupt shifts are minor. I'd give it a 4.5 as well.
