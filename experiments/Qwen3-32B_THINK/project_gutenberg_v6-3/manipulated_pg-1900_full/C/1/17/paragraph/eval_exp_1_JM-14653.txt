I'll evaluate the provided text based on the given criteria for fluency and coherence.

Let me first understand the text and look for issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
I need to look for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to parse, such as "The frequency of your early failures with him or her will show you how prudent you were not to make an attempt on the whole of humanity at once."
2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, like "And when he receives the present finally selected, he will have the conviction, always delightfully flattering to a donee, that he has been the object of a..."
3. [SYNTAX] There are some run-on sentences that lack proper punctuation, making them hard to follow.
4. [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation in some places, such as in the sentence "I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the reindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still something above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the week."
5. [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have inconsistent or missing commas where they are needed for clarity.
6. [LEXICON] Some word choices are awkward or don't quite fit, such as "We had our pain's worth, and more" which is grammatically correct but sounds odd.
7. [SPELLING] I don't notice any spelling errors in the text.
8. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have an odd structure that makes them difficult to understand, like "And the Tree! What an excess of the fantastic to pretend that all those glittering balls, those coloured candles and those variegated parcels are the blossoms of the absurd tree!"

**Coherence Issues:**
I need to look for problems with logical sequencing, transitions between ideas, and overall structure.

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics and ideas with little transition. For example, it starts with a historical account of a military explosion, then shifts to a more general discussion of Christmas traditions.
2. [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented with little to no logical connection between premises and conclusions. The text often makes assertions without providing clear supporting evidence.
3. [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas without clear signposting or connecting phrases.
4. [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without proper explanation, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument.
5. [LOGIC] The text sometimes contradicts itself or presents arguments that don't logically follow from previous statements.
6. [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is somewhat disjointed, with each chapter addressing a different aspect of the topic but lacking a clear progression or narrative arc.
7. [LOGIC] Some of the philosophical arguments are presented in a confusing manner, with complex ideas not adequately explained or contextualized.
8. [TRANSITION] The text often moves from one idea to another without clear connections, making it difficult to follow the author's line of thought.

Now I'll determine the final scores based on these observations.

For fluency, the text has several issues with syntax, sentence structure, and punctuation, but it's generally readable and the meaning is usually clear. The issues are noticeable but don't severely impair comprehension. I would rate fluency as 3.5 out of 5.

For coherence, the text has significant issues with logical sequencing, transitions, and overall structure. The arguments are often presented without clear connections, and the text jumps between ideas with little coherence. The structure is somewhat disjointed. I would rate coherence as 3 out of 5.

Let me double-check my assessment:

**Fluency (3.5/5):**
- The text is generally readable and the meaning is usually clear.
- There are some complex and awkward sentences, but they don't completely obscure the meaning.
- The text has a few issues with punctuation and sentence structure, but these are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand.

**Coherence (3/5):**
- The text has significant issues with logical sequencing and transitions.
- The arguments are often presented without clear connections.
- The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt shifts between ideas.
- The philosophical arguments are sometimes confusing and lack clear progression.

My final evaluation is:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentences - [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures - [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation - [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences - [LEXICON] Odd word choices
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Jumps between topics with little transition - [LOGIC] Arguments with weak logical connections - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas - [CLARITY] Concepts introduced without proper explanation - [LOGIC] Contradictory or illogical statements - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed overall structure - [LOGIC] Confusing philosophical arguments - [TRANSITION] Ideas presented without clear connections
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
