Alright, let me go through this text carefully to evaluate both fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. I need to look for issues like grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite long, so I'll need to scan through it to spot any errors. 

First, I notice that the text uses British English spellings, which is consistent. However, there are some instances where the punctuation might be off. For example, in the sentence "A long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who grasped the profundity of peasant life," the commas are used in a way that might make the sentence a bit confusing. It could be clearer with some restructuring.

There are a few instances of run-on sentences. For example, "He could stand before an admitted masterpiece and enjoy all its beauties, without losing sight of any defect however small, and because his mind was beautifully balanced, the small points of objection did not spoil his appreciation of the whole work." This is a long sentence that could be broken up for better readability.

I also see some missing commas where they might be expected for clarity. For example, in the sentence "The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna, and the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of Europe, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well," the commas around "but a philosopher as well" are correctly placed, but the sentence as a whole is a bit long.

Looking at word choice, the text uses archaic terms like "betwixt" and "thou" which are appropriate for the context (since it's about historical art), so that's not an issue. However, there are some instances of awkward phrasing. For example, "The milk had a good taste and a high percentage of fat. The sheep seemed larger than those of the other nomadic tribes in Tienshan and were not of the fat-tailed breed." This seems out of place in the middle of the text about Millet and might be a non-sequitur or a misplaced paragraph.

Now, moving to coherence. The text is about Jean-François Millet, his life, his art, and his influence. The structure is mostly chronological, starting with an introduction, then moving through his early life, migration to Paris, struggles for recognition, and his maturity. However, there are some sections that seem disconnected. For example, the paragraph about the Mescalero Apache Reservation in 1875 and the mention of the Qur'án in the chapter on the struggle for recognition don't seem to relate to Millet's story. These could be errors or misplaced sections.

Another issue is the sudden shift in the middle of the text to a completely different topic about the Yögurs and their experiences during the Dungan revolt. This paragraph doesn't connect to Millet and disrupts the flow. Similarly, there's a paragraph that starts with "The milk had a good taste..." which is about sheep and milk, but it's in the middle of discussing Millet's time in Barbizon. This is a clear coherence issue as it breaks the narrative flow.

There's also a paragraph that starts with "The major result of the opening 4 days of combat..." which is about a military engagement, which again is unrelated to Millet. This is another example of a non-sequitur that disrupts the coherence.

Additionally, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, the transition from discussing Millet's time in Paris to his marriage and family is smooth, but some other transitions are jarring, especially when there are unrelated paragraphs inserted.

Overall, the text has several coherence issues due to misplaced or unrelated paragraphs. The fluency is mostly good, with some long sentences and occasional awkward phrasing, but the coherence is more problematic because of the disconnected sections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and overly complex phrasing disrupt readability (e.g., long sentences with multiple clauses).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., missing commas in "The milk had a good taste and a high percentage of fat").  
- [LEXICON] Sudden shifts in register or context (e.g., "The milk had a good taste..." in a paragraph about Millet’s art).  
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in formatting (e.g., "Millet" vs. "Millet" in some sections).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected or unrelated paragraphs inserted mid-text (e.g., "The milk had a good taste..." and military combat references).  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., shifting from Millet’s biography to unrelated historical or cultural details).  
- [CLARITY] Non-sequitur content (e.g., Mescalero Apache Reservation, Qur’án references, and Dungan revolt paragraphs).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of logical flow between sections (e.g., sudden shifts from art analysis to unrelated anecdotes).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
