I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me analyze the text carefully.

## Fluency Issues

This is a long and complex philosophical and scientific text. I'll look for issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex with multiple subordinate clauses that make them hard to follow.
2. [SYNTAX] The text has some run-on sentences that could benefit from proper punctuation.
3. [SPELLING] There are a few instances of misspelled words or inconsistent spelling (e.g., "æsthetic" vs. the more common "aesthetic").
4. [PUNCTUATION] The text uses some unconventional punctuation, such as the opening "-THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE-" with dashes instead of a title format.
5. [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences lack proper punctuation, particularly at the ends of long thoughts.
6. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas in complex sentences that could help with readability.
7. [WORD CHOICE] Some word choices are archaic or overly complex for general readability (e.g., "quibbled this way and that").
8. [WORD CHOICE] There are some jargon terms without clear definitions for a general audience.
9. [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "the Day of “one fold and one shepherd.”" with mixed quotation marks and capitalization).
10. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward phrasing that makes them hard to understand at first glance.

## Coherence Issues

Now I'll evaluate how the text unfolds as a whole, looking for logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clarity, and consistency.

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps between abstract philosophical concepts and specific historical references without clear transitions.
2. [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear introduction that outlines its main points and argument.
3. [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear conclusion that summarizes the main points.
4. [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between topics without clear signposting of how they relate.
5. [LOGIC] Some arguments are introduced but not fully developed or supported by evidence.
6. [STRUCTURE] The essay sometimes circles back to earlier points without clear indication of this repetition.
7. [LOGIC] Some concepts are introduced without sufficient context for the reader to understand their significance.
8. [CLARITY] The text uses complex and abstract language that may be difficult for some readers to follow.
9. [LOGIC] The essay sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without sufficient support.
10. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new concepts without clearly connecting them to the main argument.

Let me finalize my scores:

## Fluency Score
The text has some fluency issues, but they are mostly minor and do not significantly disrupt the overall readability. The complex sentence structures and archaic language are intentional for the philosophical nature of the text. I would rate it as mostly fluent with some minor issues.

Fluency Score: 4

## Coherence Score
The text has some coherence issues, particularly in its structure and transitions between topics. While the main argument is clear in general, the essay sometimes jumps between concepts and historical references without clear connections. However, the overall argument is still understandable, and the essay maintains a consistent focus on the contrast between past and future orientations.

Coherence Score: 3.5

Now I'll format my answer as requested.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses - [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences needing proper punctuation - [SPELLING] Inconsistent spelling (e.g., "æsthetic") - [PUNCTUATION] Unconventional punctuation at beginning - [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation at ends of long thoughts - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences - [WORD CHOICE] Archaic or overly complex word choices - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent capitalization and quotation marks - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in some sentences

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Jumps between abstract concepts and specific references without transitions - [STRUCTURE] Lacks clear introduction and conclusion - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics - [LOGIC] Arguments introduced but not fully developed - [STRUCTURE] Repetition of points without clear indication - [LOGIC] Concepts introduced without sufficient context - [CLARITY] Complex language may hinder understanding - [LOGIC] Sweeping generalizations without support - [LOGIC] New concepts introduced without clear connections

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
