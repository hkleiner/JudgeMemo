Alright, I'll evaluate the text according to the given criteria for fluency and coherence. Let me carefully go through the text to identify any issues.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example: "France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater you can come and go almost as freely as before the war." The sentence structure is awkward and unclear.
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling errors. For example: "euphenism" instead of "euphemism" (p. 11), "miliary" instead of "military" (p. 12), "Remiremont" instead of "Remiramont" (p. 13).
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward or overly complex syntax. For example: "If you bring even one letter to society, either in France or any European capital, all doors are open to you, for society is accustomed to strangers and variety, and is often bored with itself; which the bourgeoisie, of France at least, never seems to be."
- [LEXICON] There are some word choice issues. For example: "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe, and long since came to the conclusion that all American embassies feel they are created for is to look solemn and important and give receptions." The phrasing is awkward.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues. For example: "But Germany was not always thus. "High deeds, O Germans, are to come from you," wrote Wordsworth in his "Sonnets dedicated to Liberty." And it throws light upon the nature of Missions to recall that when she lay at the feet of Napoleon after Jena, the mission proclaimed for her by Fichte was one of peace and righteousness--to penetrate the life of humanity by her religion--and he denounced the dreams of universal monarchy which would destroy national individuality." The punctuation is inconsistent and sometimes confusing.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] There are some logical inconsistencies. For example: The text begins with a detailed account of the author's attempts to enter the war zone, then shifts to various historical and philosophical discussions that seem disconnected from the main narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat disjointed. The text jumps between different topics and locations without clear transitions. For example: After describing the author's experiences in the war zone, the text shifts to discussing historical battles and philosophical ideas without clear connections.
- [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or confusing. For example: "The atmosphere cleared as by magic. My carnet rouge was stamped, and I was bowed out not only with the politeness to which I was accustomed, but with frank pleasant eyes, wide open, and some practical information regarding the formalities of departure." The meaning is not entirely clear.
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between ideas. For example: The text shifts from the author's experiences in the war zone to philosophical discussions about German militarism and then to historical battles without clear transitions.
- [REPETITION] There is some repetition of ideas and phrases. For example: The author frequently returns to the theme of her attempts to enter the war zone and the difficulties she faces, which becomes repetitive.
- [ABSTRACTION] Some sections are overly abstract and disconnected from the main narrative. For example: The text includes lengthy philosophical discussions about German militarism and historical battles that seem disconnected from the author's personal experiences in the war zone.

Based on these observations, I would rate the text as follows:

For fluency: The text is generally readable but contains some grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues that occasionally disrupt the flow. However, these issues are not so severe that they make the text difficult to understand. I would give it a score of 3.5.

For coherence: The text has some logical inconsistencies, disjointed structure, and abrupt transitions that affect the overall coherence. The frequent shifts between different topics and the inclusion of abstract philosophical discussions that seem disconnected from the main narrative reduce the overall coherence. I would give it a score of 3.5.

Let me review my assessment again to ensure accuracy:

Fluency: The text is generally readable with some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that occasionally disrupt the flow. The errors are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand. Score: 3.5

Coherence: The text has some logical inconsistencies and disjointed structure. The frequent shifts between different topics and the inclusion of abstract philosophical discussions that seem disconnected from the main narrative reduce the overall coherence. Score: 3.5
