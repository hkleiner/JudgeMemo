Let me analyze this long text about Sir Joshua Reynolds.

First, I'll check for fluency issues, which include grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation problems.

Looking through the text, I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] "Increasingly, uncertainty about the meaning and value of life generates anxiety and confusion. Speaking about this condition in our own age Bahá’u’lláh says:" - The transition between these sentences is awkward and lacks a proper introductory phrase for the quote.
- [SPELLING] There are a few instances of spelling errors or unusual spellings, such as "Shakspere" instead of "Shakespeare."
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence about Reynolds' deafness and his sitters being of diverse kinds is quite long and could be clearer.
- [LEXICON] There are occasional word choice issues, such as "Lion Comique" which seems out of place and unclear.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have missing or incorrect punctuation, particularly in dialogue or quotes.

Now for coherence issues, which relate to logical sequencing, smooth transitions, clarity, and consistent structure:

Looking through the text, I notice:
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing Reynolds to making statements about global integration and modern issues in the twenty-first century, which seems out of context and unrelated to the main subject.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Reynolds to mentioning the Mescaleros and Apache campsite with no clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Some passages are confusing or lack clear connections between ideas. For example, the sudden shift to discussing a violinist and audience reaction seems disconnected from the main narrative about Reynolds.
- [TRANSITION] The text often moves abruptly from one topic to another without proper transitional phrases. For example, the shift from discussing Reynolds' deafness to talking about timber construction is jarring.
- [INCONSISTENCY] The text begins and ends with different tones and styles, suggesting it was compiled from multiple sources or written at different times.

Based on these observations, I'll now assign scores for fluency and coherence.

For fluency:
The text is generally well-written with proper grammar and structure in most places. There are some minor issues with sentence structure and word choice, but they don't significantly impede understanding. I would rate this as mostly fluent with some minor issues, which would place it at a 4 on the scale.

For coherence:
The text has significant coherence issues. It jumps between topics, has logical inconsistencies, and lacks smooth transitions between ideas. The inclusion of unrelated topics like global integration, Mescaleros, and timber construction disrupts the flow of the narrative about Reynolds. The text appears to be a compilation of different pieces rather than a cohesive whole. This would place it at a 3 on the scale.

Let me review my assessment once more to ensure it's accurate.

Fluency:
- The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and structure.
- There are some minor issues with sentence structure and word choice, but they don't significantly impede understanding.
- I would rate this as mostly fluent with some minor issues, which would place it at a 4 on the scale.

Coherence:
- The text has significant coherence issues.
- It jumps between topics and has logical inconsistencies.
- The inclusion of unrelated topics like global integration, Mescaleros, and timber construction disrupts the flow of the narrative about Reynolds.
- The text appears to be a compilation of different pieces rather than a cohesive whole.
- This would place it at a 3 on the scale.

Let me finalize my scores and issues.
