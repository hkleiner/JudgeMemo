Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The text is quite long, but I'll focus on the parts I can see.

Looking at the first few paragraphs, the sentences are complex but well-structured. For example, "Little did I think, during my college days, that I should ever become a teacher." The use of "should" here is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. 

I notice some repetition, like "I was unable to say" and later "I was unprepared for a definite position." These don't seem to be grammatical issues but might affect readability. 

There's a part where it says, "I must not accept just a mere job..." The phrase "just a mere job" is a bit redundant. Also, "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession..." The word "manner" here might be better as "way" for clarity.

Moving on, I see some sentences with passive voice that could be more active, like "The situation that confronted me after deciding to become a teacher temporarily..." Passive voice isn't an error, but it can make the text feel less direct. 

In the middle of the text, there's a paragraph that starts with "Given the earlier events in Baghdad..." This seems out of context and might be a coherence issue rather than fluency. I'll note that for the coherence section.

Looking at the chapter on school activities, there are some run-on sentences, like "The new plan for athletics worked splendidly with the exception of a few vigorous protests from boys who were debarred from playing on account of poor scholarship." This is a long sentence and could be split for better readability.

In the chapter on the janitor, the transition from the janitor's cold reception to the president's story is abrupt. The president's story seems unrelated and might be a coherence issue.

Overall, the text has some minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasing but is mostly fluent. The main issues are in coherence, which I'll address next.

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different topics and time periods without clear transitions. For example, the paragraph about Baghdad and Bahá’u’lláh seems disconnected from the rest of the narrative about becoming a teacher. This is a significant coherence issue.

There are also parts where the narrative shifts without explanation. For instance, the section about the janitor's story is followed by a paragraph about Reynolds, which seems unrelated. This abrupt shift disrupts the flow.

The text also includes some unrelated anecdotes, like the part about the Ottoman authorities and the Sarö Yögurs, which don't connect to the main theme of becoming a schoolmaster. These insertions make the narrative disjointed.

Additionally, the text has multiple chapters that sometimes overlap in content or jump between different aspects of teaching without clear links. For example, the chapter on the janitor is followed by a detailed section on school activities, which then transitions into a historical account about the Ottoman Empire. These transitions are not smooth and confuse the reader.

The overall structure of the text is a series of anecdotes and lessons, but the connections between them are not always clear. The narrative lacks a cohesive thread that ties the different chapters together, leading to a fragmented reading experience.

In summary, the fluency issues are minor, but the coherence problems are significant. The text jumps between unrelated topics, has abrupt transitions, and includes anecdotes that don't fit the main narrative. These issues affect the overall coherence more than the fluency.
