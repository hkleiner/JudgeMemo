Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues, following the instructions provided.

# Fluency Issues Analysis

I'll look for problems related to syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [GRAMMAR] The text has some grammatical issues. For example: "He, also, speaketh the truth..." should be "He also speaks the truth..."
2. [GRAMMAR] "It is because he conceived his ideal after this fashion that this unerring painter of so many military types and scenes never attempted to picture skirmishes or battles." This sentence is overly complex and awkwardly constructed.
3. [SPELLING] There are some minor spelling issues, though they appear to be limited.
4. [SYNTAX] The text occasionally uses overly complex sentence structures that make reading difficult.
5. [PUNCTUATION] The text uses some unusual punctuation, like em dashes without proper spacing.
6. [LEXICON] There are a few instances where word choice seems slightly off or archaic for the context.
7. [SYNTAX] "But just at this crisis another damnatory report exploded..." uses an unusual and somewhat jarring word choice in context.
8. [GRAMMAR] "He, also, speaketh the truth..." is grammatically incorrect.
9. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are extremely long and contain multiple clauses that make them hard to follow.
10. [GRAMMAR] "It is impossible to imagine how different the history of the past century and a half would have been had any of the leading arbiters of world affairs addressed by Bahá'u'lláh spared time..." has a complex conditional construction that is grammatically correct but very difficult to parse.

# Coherence Issues Analysis

I'll look for problems related to logical sequencing, transitions between ideas, consistency, and overall narrative flow.

1. [LOGIC] The text suddenly introduces a long passage about Bahá'u'lláh and the Bahá'í faith without any clear connection to Meissonier or the previous content.
2. [LOGIC] The passage about Buddhist temples and rituals appears to be out of place and has no clear connection to Meissonier or the rest of the text.
3. [LOGIC] The text mentions "The Reporting Sergeant" as a "miniature sketch made, in order to try the ground, on the margin of the plate on which The Smoker was etched" but then immediately introduces "He is the violinist who has created such a sensation here, Angelo Diotti" which seems disconnected from the previous discussion.
4. [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure, with some chapters having a clear narrative flow while others feel more like a collection of loosely related anecdotes.
5. [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear.
6. [LOGIC] The text mentions "Brother, is she ever radiating fear! It's practically drowning your own mind out." This appears to be a dialogue fragment that has no clear context or connection to the surrounding text about Meissonier.
7. [LOGIC] "Good heavens! child, where have you been?" said Mr. Otis, rather angrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them." This dialogue fragment also appears out of context and unrelated to the previous discussion about Meissonier's paintings.
8. [LOGIC] The text mentions "Round three sides of the second story ran small rooms under the same roof..." which seems to be a description of a building that has no clear connection to Meissonier or the previous content.
9. [LOGIC] The passage about British science and optimism ("Principles seemed to have been discovered which guaranteed a further advance in almost every direction, intellectual as well as material...") appears to be out of context and unrelated to Meissonier.
10. [LOGIC] The text mentions "However, the Academicians feared he would be an unorthodox master for youth, and appointed another in his place." but doesn't clearly explain who "he" refers to in this context.

Now I'll rate the text according to the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency:
The text is generally well-written with mostly correct grammar and clear phrasing. There are some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall readability. The text flows reasonably well and is generally easy to understand.

Based on the scale, I would rate the fluency as a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

For Coherence:
The text has some coherence issues, particularly with the inclusion of several passages that seem out of context or unrelated to the main subject (Meissonier). These include the Bahá'u'lláh passage, the Buddhist temple description, and various dialogue fragments that appear to have no clear connection to the content. These disruptions affect the logical flow of the text and can be confusing to the reader.

Based on the scale, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me finalize my assessment:

Fluency: 4.5
Coherence: 3.5
