Alright, let's start evaluating this text based on the given criteria. First, I need to assess fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is a detailed guide on spices, their histories, uses, and cultivation. I'll look for issues like grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. 

I notice some repeated use of "altho" instead of "although" – that's a spelling issue. There are also some awkward phrasings, like "brot" instead of "brought." There's a mix of past and present tenses in some sentences, which can be confusing. For example, "Boucher had been one of the brilliant group..." followed by a shift in narrative about historical figures. Also, some sentences are run-on or have poor punctuation, making them hard to follow. There are also some inconsistencies in hyphenation and capitalization, like "Salanacea" instead of "Solanaceae." 

Now, coherence. The text jumps between topics without clear transitions. For example, the chapter on Allspice suddenly shifts to a historical narrative about Boucher and the French court, which seems out of place. Similarly, in the Capsicum chapter, there's a paragraph about a military location and battle details that don't relate to the topic of peppers. These abrupt shifts disrupt the flow. The text also includes some unrelated anecdotes or historical snippets that don't connect to the main subject, like the part about the carp pond and Virginia. There are also instances where the structure is unclear, like the sudden shift to discussing religion in the Ginger chapter. The overall organization is somewhat disjointed, with some sections well-structured and others lacking clear progression. 

Putting this all together, I'll list the issues under their respective categories and then assign scores based on the severity of these problems.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect spelling of "altho" instead of "although."  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "brot" (should be "brought") and inconsistent verb tenses.  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and fragmented clauses, e.g., "The history of spices... journal, duly protected by copyright, with the accompanying illustrations."  
- [LEXICON] Misused terms like "Salanacea" (should be "Solanaceae") and "thoroly" (should be "thoroughly").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in long, complex sentences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts in narrative, e.g., historical anecdotes about Boucher in the Allspice chapter.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sections, such as military descriptions in the Capsicum chapter unrelated to spices.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between topics (e.g., sudden shift to Virginia’s lost carp pond in Ginger).  
- [CLARITY] Unrelated historical or literary excerpts (e.g., religious discourse in Cinnamon) disrupt the flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
