Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, **Fluency**. I need to look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text seems to be a biography of Rosa Bonheur, written in a somewhat old-fashioned style. Let me scan through it.

- I notice some **spelling errors**, like "Silvelas" instead of "Silvelas" (maybe correct, but it's not a common name). Wait, no, that might be a proper noun. Hmm. Also, "Rue Saint-Antoine" is correctly spelled. 
- **Grammar**: There are some run-on sentences, especially in the longer paragraphs. For example, "The revolution of 1830 ensued and Rosa witnessed it develop beneath the windows of her father's dwelling." The use of "ensued" is a bit formal and might be better as "happened" or "occurred", but it's not incorrect. 
- **Syntax and word choice**: Some sentences are a bit awkwardly structured. For example, "He went directly to the Silvelas' in the capacity of instructor of drawing" – "in the capacity of" is a bit old-fashioned and could be phrased more smoothly. 
- **Punctuation**: There are some missing commas in complex sentences. For example, "They joined him in 1829 and were installed in the Rue Saint-Antoine." The conjunction "and" here doesn't require a comma unless there's a pause. 
- **Phrasing**: Some phrases are repetitive or could be more concise. For example, "The young couple started upon married life with no other fortune than their mutual attachment and equal courage." The word "started upon" is a bit archaic and could be simplified to "began married life".

Now, moving on to **Coherence**. I need to check the logical flow, structure, transitions, and clarity. The text is a biography, so it should follow a chronological order. 

- **Structure**: The text is divided into chapters, which is good, but some sections jump around in time without clear transitions. For example, the chapter on the first successes starts with Rosa's studies at the Louvre, then jumps to her father's movements, then to her work at the slaughterhouses. 
- **Transitions**: Some paragraphs transition smoothly, but others are abrupt. For example, after discussing the 1830 revolution, the text suddenly moves to the family moving to a new house without a clear transition. 
- **Clarity**: Some parts are confusing due to the old-fashioned language and complex sentence structures. For example, "The ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man of Feeling had arisen in the land; and France, humiliated in war, and resenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class, was openly resenting it and all its works." This sentence is convoluted and hard to follow. 
- **Repetition**: There are some repeated phrases or ideas. For example, the mention of Rosa's dedication to her art is repeated multiple times, which might be intentional for emphasis but could be considered repetitive. 
- **Logical sequencing**: Some events are presented out of order or without sufficient context. For example, the part about the American journey in 1854 is mentioned without a clear link to the previous events in her life. 

Putting it all together, the text has some fluency issues with grammar, syntax, and phrasing, and coherence issues with structure, transitions, and clarity. The scores would need to reflect these issues while considering the overall readability and how much they detract from the text's quality.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in old-fashioned constructions (e.g., "He went directly to the Silvelas' in the capacity of instructor of drawing").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., "The ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion; the Man of Feeling had arisen in the land").  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or verbose expressions (e.g., "started upon married life").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "They joined him in 1829 and were installed in the Rue Saint-Antoine").  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive sentence structures in descriptive passages.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between unrelated events (e.g., shifting from the 1830 revolution to the family’s relocation without context).  
- [STRUCTURE] Chronological inconsistencies in some sections (e.g., the American journey in 1854 lacks clear temporal linkage).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing convoluted sentences (e.g., "France, humiliated in war, and resenting the follies and the greed of her shameless privileged class, was openly resenting it and all its works").  
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitional phrases between paragraphs, causing disjointed flow.  
- [REPETITION] Redundant emphasis on Rosa’s dedication to art without new insights.
