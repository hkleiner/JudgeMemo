I'll analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

1) [GRAMMAR] - There are some grammatical errors in the text. For example, "There is a great deal of very unnecessary cant about the over-dressing of the common people." This sentence is grammatically correct, but there are other instances of awkward phrasing.
2) [SPELLING] - I don't see any obvious spelling errors in the text.
3) [SYNTAX] - The syntax is generally complex and formal, which is appropriate for the 19th-century narrative style, but there are some awkward constructions. For example, "The coffee-shops too, at which clerks and young men employed in counting-houses can procure their breakfasts, are also open."
4) [LEXICON] - The vocabulary is appropriate for the time period and style of the text, but there are some instances of archaic or unusual word choices that might be confusing to modern readers. For example, "stuff" is used repeatedly in place of specific place names.
5) [PUNCTUATION] - The punctuation is generally appropriate for the style of the text, but there are a few instances of awkward or inconsistent punctuation. For example, "The sun that rises over the quiet streets of London on a bright Sunday morning, shines till his setting, on gay and happy faces."

**Coherence Issues:**

1) [STRUCTURE] - The text has a clear structure with three chapters, but the flow between sections is sometimes abrupt. The transition from one scene to another is not always smooth.
2) [LOGIC] - The logic of the narrative is generally sound, but there are some instances where the reasoning is not fully explained or seems disconnected. For example, the transition from describing Sunday activities to discussing legislation is somewhat abrupt.
3) [CLARITY] - The text is generally clear, but there are some instances where the meaning is not entirely clear due to the complex sentence structure. For example, "The provisions of the bill introduced into the House of Commons by Sir Andrew Agnew, and thrown out by that House on the motion for the second reading, on the 8th of May in the present year, by a majority of 32, may very fairly be taken as a test..."
4) [TRANSITION] - The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are generally smooth for a 19th-century narrative, but there are some instances where the flow could be improved. The text often shifts between different perspectives and topics without clear transitions.
5) [REPETITION] - There is some repetition of ideas and phrases, particularly in the second and third chapters where the author is making arguments about Sunday legislation.

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency Score:** 4.0
The text is generally fluent with complex but appropriate sentence structures for its time period. There are some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but these do not significantly disrupt the reading experience. The vocabulary is appropriate for the style, though some archaic or unusual word choices might be confusing to modern readers.

**Coherence Score:** 4.0
The text has a clear structure with a logical progression of ideas, though the transitions between sections could be smoother. The narrative is generally coherent, but there are some instances where the flow of ideas is abrupt or the reasoning is not fully explained. The text covers a complex topic and shifts between different perspectives, but it maintains a consistent argument throughout.
