Alright, let's analyze the given text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, I'll read through the text to get a general understanding. It's a philosophical essay about the changing nature of Christmas, its historical roots, and the importance of maintaining goodwill. It's quite lengthy and complex, with many ideas and arguments.

For fluency, I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling mistakes, punctuation issues, and word choice problems. For coherence, I'll look for logical flow issues, abrupt transitions, unclear ideas, and inconsistencies in the narrative.

Let me go through the text systematically:

Fluency Issues:
1. [GRAMMAR] "And the next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care; we suffered gladly;" - This sentence has unnecessary semicolons that make it harder to read.
2. [GRAMMAR] "Such a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward the change in us is extraordinarily rapid." - The transition between these two sentences is abrupt and the second sentence is missing a subject.
3. [GRAMMAR] "And thenceforward the change in us is extraordinarily rapid." - "thenceforward" is not a commonly used word and might be better replaced with "from then on" for clarity.
4. [GRAMMAR] "The peculiarities of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a vacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude towards another vacation--the summer holiday." - The sentence structure is confusing with the use of "which" referring to "peculiarities" rather than "attitude."
5. [GRAMMAR] "If any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and the truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in the esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on the heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no more." - This is an extremely long and complex sentence that would be easier to understand if broken into shorter sentences.
6. [GRAMMAR] "This book is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can look facts cheerfully in the face." - The transition between these two sentences is abrupt.
7. [GRAMMAR] "That Christmas has lost some of its magic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not dispute." - The sentence structure is awkward and could be clearer.
8. [GRAMMAR] "To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to understand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may attach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man." - The sentence structure is complex and could be clearer.
9. [GRAMMAR] "If the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon, confined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children then it follows that Christmas has always been decadent..." - Missing "then" after "children" makes this sentence grammatically incorrect.
10. [GRAMMAR] "They are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary!" - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of semicolon is inappropriate here.

Coherence Issues:
1. [LOGIC] The author makes many assertions without providing sufficient evidence or logical support. For example, the claim that Christmas has lost its magic is stated as a fact without explanation of how this was determined.
2. [LOGIC] The essay jumps between different topics and ideas without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Christmas traditions to philosophical musings about faith and science with little connection between these concepts.
3. [LOGIC] The argument that the decline in Christmas spirit is due to scientific discoveries is presented without addressing counterarguments or alternative explanations.
4. [LOGIC] The essay often makes sweeping generalizations about human nature and societal changes without providing specific examples or evidence to support these claims.
5. [LOGIC] The conclusion in Chapter 5 about revitalizing Christmas is somewhat abrupt and doesn't clearly follow from the previous discussions.
6. [STRUCTURE] The essay is divided into chapters, but the structure doesn't always follow a logical progression of ideas. Some chapters seem to introduce new concepts without sufficient setup.
7. [CLARITY] Some of the language is overly complex and could be more accessible to a general audience. The author frequently uses philosophical and abstract terms without explanation.
8. [CLARITY] The essay sometimes assumes a level of knowledge about Christmas traditions and history that may not be shared by all readers.
9. [CLARITY] The author makes references to specific individuals and works (like Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, and Huxley) without providing enough context for readers who may not be familiar with these figures.
10. [TRANSITION] The essay lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning at times.

Based on my assessment, I would rate the fluency as a 4. The text is generally well-written and readable, but contains some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing that could be improved.

For coherence, I would rate it as a 3.5. The text presents many interesting ideas, but the logical flow and organization could be improved. The connections between ideas are sometimes unclear, and the argument could be more clearly presented.

Let me refine my assessment based on the specific criteria for each metric:

Fluency:
- The text is generally well-written and readable, with mostly clear phrasing and grammar.
- There are a few grammatical issues and awkward phrasings, but these don't significantly impact comprehension.
- The vocabulary is sophisticated but appropriate for the philosophical nature of the text.

Coherence:
- The text presents a complex argument with many interconnected ideas.
- The logical flow is sometimes disrupted by abrupt transitions and unclear connections between ideas.
- The argument could be more clearly structured and better supported with evidence.
- The text often makes sweeping generalizations without sufficient explanation.

Based on this refined assessment, I would rate fluency as a 4 and coherence as a 3.5.
