I need to evaluate the given text for two metrics: fluency and coherence, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. I'll follow the instructions carefully and identify issues with labels and bullet points for each metric before providing the final scores.

First, I'll read through the text and identify fluency issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb forms.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward syntax or word order that makes them hard to follow.
- [LEXICON] There are some word choice issues, particularly with the repeated use of "the thing" which seems to be a placeholder for names or places.
- [SPELLING] I don't see any spelling errors in the text.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have awkward punctuation or missing commas.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
- [LOGIC] The text appears to be a biography of Fran√ßois Boucher, but it has some logical inconsistencies and gaps in the narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is generally chronological, but there are some abrupt transitions and disjointed sections.
- [CLARITY] The repeated use of "the thing" as a placeholder makes the text less clear and hinders understanding.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt or missing.
- [REFERENCE] There are some unclear references, particularly when the text refers to people or events without sufficient context.

Now I'll rate the fluency and coherence based on these observations:

For fluency:
The text is generally readable, but contains noticeable grammatical issues, awkward syntax, and the repeated use of "the thing" as a placeholder. These issues would be distracting to a reader but don't make the text completely unintelligible. I would rate this as a 3 on the fluency scale.

For coherence:
The text has a clear chronological structure as a biography, but the repeated use of "the thing" as a placeholder significantly hinders coherence. There are also some logical inconsistencies and gaps in the narrative. The text tells a story but has several coherence issues that would make it harder to follow. I would rate this as a 2.5 on the coherence scale.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures with excessive length and complex clauses
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent use of terms (e.g., "the thing" as placeholder for names/locations)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions in several places
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or misplaced commas in complex sentences
- [STYLE] Repetitive phrasing and overuse of certain expressions

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent narrative flow with abrupt transitions between events
- [REFERENCE] Unclear antecedents for pronouns and repeated use of "the thing" as placeholder
- [LOGIC] Gaps in chronological progression and missing contextual information
- [CLARITY] Confusing use of historical events without clear connections to Boucher's life
- [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitional phrases between paragraphs and sections

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
