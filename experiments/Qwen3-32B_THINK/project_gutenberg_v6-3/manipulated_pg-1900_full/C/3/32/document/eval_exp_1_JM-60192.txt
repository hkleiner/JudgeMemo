I'll evaluate the given text according to the requested criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll analyze the text for fluency issues:
1. Grammar: I'll look for grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and proper use of articles.
2. Spelling: I'll check for misspelled words.
3. Syntax: I'll examine sentence structure for awkward phrasing or incorrect word order.
4. Lexicon: I'll look for inappropriate or incorrect word choices.
5. Phrasing: I'll assess for awkward or unnatural phrasing.
6. Punctuation: I'll check for correct use of punctuation marks.

For coherence:
1. Logic: I'll check if the text follows a logical progression.
2. Structure: I'll examine if the text has a clear organization.
3. Clarity: I'll assess if the meaning is clear and not ambiguous.
4. Transition: I'll look for smooth transitions between ideas and sections.

Let me review the text and identify specific issues:

Fluency issues I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] "The history of spices, with other valuable information to all branches of the grocery trade" - The preposition "to" is likely incorrect; it should be "for" or "for all branches."
- [GRAMMAR] "was originally written by Robert O. Fielding, of the staff of the Trade Register, in which the several articles appeared in various issues of that journal" - This sentence is awkward and has a dangling modifier.
- [GRAMMAR] "It is all meat for the salesman who realizes that success in trade these days depends upon knowing where the goods he handles were produced, how to judge their qualities, how they are prepared for market, and what are their uses." - The last phrase "what are their uses" should be parallel to the others with "how" - "how they are used."
- [SPELLING] "altho" is used multiple times instead of the correct spelling "although."
- [SPELLING] "thoroly" is used instead of "thoroughly."
- [SPELLING] "disappearance of the flower" seems incorrect; it should be "appearance" if referring to the berries forming.
- [GRAMMAR] "The berries (sometimes called corns), which form on the disappearance of the flower, are picked unripe, altho fully grown" - This is awkwardly phrased.
- [GRAMMAR] "The dried berries are light, brittle, of roundish form and crowned with the remains of the flower calyx in the shape of a raised, seared-like ring" - The phrase "seared-like" is likely incorrect; it should be "seared-like" or "seal-like."
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" is used multiple times instead of the actual place names.
- [GRAMMAR] "Only in a stuff--where it is cultivated in plantations called Pimento walks--does the pimento tree grow to perfection" - This is awkwardly phrased.
- [SPELLING] "It is thought to combine the flavor of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg, hence it is called allspice." - The phrase "hence it is called" is awkwardly placed.
- [GRAMMAR] "It is often employed to disguise the nasty taste of medicine." - "nasty" is a strong word that might not be appropriate in this context.
- [SPELLING] "a thing" is used multiple times instead of the actual place names.
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" is used multiple times instead of the actual place names.

Coherence issues I notice:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is structured as a series of chapters on different spices, but there are no clear transitions between these chapters.
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from one topic to another without clear connections or explanations.
- [LOGIC] Some chapters begin with the same phrase "The history of [spice], with other valuable information to all branches of the grocery trade" which is repetitive and doesn't help with flow.
- [LOGIC] There are many references to "a stuff" and "the thing" instead of actual place names, which makes the text confusing.
- [CLARITY] The text is dense with technical information but lacks clear explanations for general readers.
- [LOGIC] The text often goes into great detail about various species and varieties of plants without clear organization.
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between historical information, botanical descriptions, and commercial information without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The text includes many references to other plants and spices that seem to be included without clear connections to the main topic.

Based on these observations, I'll now provide the evaluation according to the requested format:

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing and sentence structure throughout the text
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "altho" instead of "although"
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "thoroly" instead of "thoroughly"
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "a stuff" and "the thing" instead of actual place names
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward and confusing sentence structure in descriptions of plant characteristics
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization in scientific names
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of tenses
- [SPELLING] Repeated misspellings of "seared-like" which likely should be "seal-like"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure with chapters on different spices but no clear overall organization
- [LOGIC] Repetitive opening phrases for each chapter that don't contribute to flow
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between historical information, botanical descriptions, and commercial details
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent references to "a stuff" and "the thing" instead of actual locations
- [CLARITY] Dense technical information without clear explanations for general readers
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent depth of information across different chapters
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear transitions between different topics within chapters
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent focus with some chapters going into great detail about plant species while others are more general

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
