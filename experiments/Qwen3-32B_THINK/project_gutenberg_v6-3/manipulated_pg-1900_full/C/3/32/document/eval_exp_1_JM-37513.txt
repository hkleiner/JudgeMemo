Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice and punctuation.

Looking through the text, there are a few instances where the grammar seems off. For example, in the line "persistence of some the stuffain the development of Life upon its surface," the word "stuffain" appears to be a typo or a misused word. The correct term might be "stuff" or "substance," and the sentence structure here is confusing. This is a [SPELLING] issue.

Next, the sentence "the persistence of some Cause which transcends our knowledge and conception. In asserting it we assert an thing without beginning or end." The phrase "an thing" should be "a thing," which is a [GRAMMAR] issue. Also, the transition between sentences is abrupt, making the flow a bit choppy, which is a [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example is the sentence "And then we must remember that these main principles are supplemented by a great number of ancillary generalizations, many of which have been incorporated in the scientific doctrine which is current to-day." The phrase "incorporated in the scientific doctrine which is current to-day" is a bit wordy and could be simplified for better clarity, indicating a [LEXICON] issue.

Moving on to coherence, the text is a detailed academic discussion on Spencer's philosophy of science. The main idea is how Spencer's theories on evolution and the philosophy of science have influenced and are perceived by later thinkers. The text is structured in a logical manner, moving from Spencer's early influences to his theories and their implications. However, there are a few points where the transitions between ideas could be smoother.

For instance, the text jumps from discussing Spencer's views on the Unknowable to a critique by Bergson. The connection between these two sections is somewhat abrupt, making the transition less smooth. This is a [LOGIC] issue. Additionally, some paragraphs are quite long and dense with information, which might make it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of ideas, indicating a [STRUCTURE] issue.

There are also instances where the text refers back to earlier points without clear reference, which could cause confusion. For example, the line "In how many senses he uses the word 'force' I am not prepared to say." This is a [CLARITY] issue because it's not immediately clear which context or discussion the author is referring to.

Overall, the text is well-written with a high level of academic discourse, but there are a few minor issues that affect fluency and coherence. The fluency issues are mostly minor and don't significantly disrupt the readability, while the coherence issues are present but the overall structure and logic of the text remain intact.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the persistence of some Cause which transcends our knowledge and conception. In asserting it we assert an thing..." (incorrect article "an" before "thing").  
- [SPELLING] "persistence of some the stuffain the development of Life..." (likely a typo or misused word "stuffain").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward transitions between sentences, e.g., "In asserting it we assert an thing without beginning or end'. There must, he holds..." (choppy phrasing).  
- [LEXICON] Wordy phrasing: "...incorporated in the scientific doctrine which is current to-day" (could be simplified).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between Spencer’s ideas and critiques (e.g., Bergson’s analysis) without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly long paragraphs with dense, complex ideas that hinder readability.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references: "In how many senses he uses the word 'force' I am not prepared to say" (lacks context).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
