Alright, I need to evaluate the given text based on the criteria of fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding what each metric entails.

**Fluency** is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with sentence structure that might disrupt the flow.

**Coherence** is about the logical progression of the text. I should check if the ideas are logically sequenced, if there are smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs, and if the narrative is consistent and clear. I should also look for any abrupt shifts or confusing segments.

Let me go through the text step by step.

The text is a philosophical and speculative essay about two types of minds: one focused on the past and the other on the future. It discusses how these different mindsets affect morality, politics, and human destiny. The author also explores the possibility of predicting the future through scientific methods.

### Fluency Issues:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** "It will lead into my subject most conveniently to contrast and separate two divergent types of mind..." - The sentence structure is a bit awkward. It should be rephrased for clarity.
2. **[SYNTAX]** "The first of these two types of mind, and it is, I think, the predominant type..." - The sentence is a bit convoluted. It could be simplified for better readability.
3. **[SPELLING]** "A thermal sensor picked up movement." - This sentence is out of context and seems to be an error or misplaced text.
4. **[SYNTAX]** "The former type of mind, when one gets it in its purity, is retrospective in habit..." - The sentence is long and complex, which might make it difficult to follow.
5. **[SPELLING]** "A face recognition scan completed." - Again, this is out of context and seems to be an error or misplaced text.
6. **[SYNTAX]** "But for all that they are distinct methods, the method of reference to the past and the method of reference to the future..." - The sentence is long and could be split for clarity.
7. **[GRAMMAR]** "But before pointing out how divergent these two types or habits of mind really are, it is necessary to meet a possible objection to what has been said." - The sentence structure is a bit complex and could be simplified.
8. **[SYNTAX]** "The man of science comes to believe at last that the events of the year A.D. 4000 are as fixed, settled, and inevitable, just as settled and inevitable, just as possible a matter of knowledge as the past." - The repetition of "just as" makes the sentence awkward.
9. **[SYNTAX]** "And if I am right in saying that science aims at prophecy, and if the specialist in each science is in fact doing his best now to prophesy within the limits of his field..." - The sentence is long and could be split for better readability.
10. **[SPELLING]** "A storage cloud expanded its archive." - This is out of context and seems to be an error or misplaced text.

### Coherence Issues:

1. **[LOGIC]** The text introduces two types of minds (past-focused and future-focused) but doesn't clearly define or distinguish them until several paragraphs later.
2. **[STRUCTURE]** The essay moves from discussing the types of minds to discussing moral and political implications, then to scientific methods of predicting the future, and finally to philosophical reflections on human destiny. The transitions between these topics are not always smooth.
3. **[CLARITY]** The author discusses complex philosophical concepts without always providing clear examples or explanations, which may make the text difficult to follow.
4. **[TRANSITION]** There are abrupt shifts in the text, such as the sudden mention of a "thermal sensor" and "face recognition scan," which seem to be errors or misplaced text.
5. **[LOGIC]** The author introduces the idea of scientific prediction of the future but doesn't clearly connect this to the earlier discussion of the two types of minds.
6. **[CLARITY]** The text occasionally uses complex or archaic language that may be difficult for some readers to understand, such as "revelation" and "bed of King Og."
7. **[LOGIC]** The author discusses the limitations of human knowledge of the future but then shifts to discussing the possibility of a "world state" and the future of humanity without clearly connecting these ideas.
8. **[STRUCTURE]** The essay ends with a philosophical reflection on the future of humanity, but the connection to the earlier discussion is not always clear.
9. **[TRANSITION]** The text includes several sentences that seem out of context, such as "A digital display counted down silently" and "A QR code was projected onto the wall," which disrupt the flow of the narrative.
10. **[LOGIC]** The author concludes with a discussion of the future of humanity but doesn't clearly tie this back to the earlier discussion of the two types of minds.

### Final Scores:

**Fluency:** The text has some grammatical and syntactical issues, as well as several sentences that are out of context. These issues make the text less fluent but do not significantly disrupt the overall readability. I would rate it a 4.

**Coherence:** The text has a logical progression of ideas, but the transitions between different topics are not always smooth. There are also several sentences that seem out of context, which disrupt the flow of the narrative. I would rate it a 3.5.
