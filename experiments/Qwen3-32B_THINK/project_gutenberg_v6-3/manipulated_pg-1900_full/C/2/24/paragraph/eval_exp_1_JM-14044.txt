I'll evaluate the provided text according to the given criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand the text and identify issues:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent punctuation, particularly with missing commas and periods where they should be.
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling inconsistencies, such as "medi√¶valism" which is a less common but acceptable variant, but not consistently used.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical inconsistencies, such as "He and his men, caught all unready, clumsy with the burdens that they carried, were shot to pieces" which has awkward parallel structure.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices seem inconsistent with the rest of the text, particularly the modern references to technology at the end of some chapters.

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text is a historical narrative with a critical perspective on the legend of "The Bowmen," but the sudden modern references at the end of some chapters (like "A hoverboard leaned against the wall" or "The surveillance drone made no sound") disrupt the logical flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured as a narrative, but the random modern references break the narrative continuity.
- [CLARITY] Some of the historical context and references are quite dense and could be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the time period or specific historical events mentioned.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections are generally smooth, but the modern references at the end of some chapters create jarring transitions.

Now I'll rate the text according to the criteria:

For Fluency:
- The text is generally well-written with clear, natural phrasing.
- There are some grammatical issues and complex sentences that could be simplified.
- The spelling is generally consistent, though some archaic spellings are used.
- The punctuation is mostly appropriate, though there are some inconsistencies.
Overall, I would rate the fluency as 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with some minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

For Coherence:
- The narrative is generally logical and well-structured.
- The content is coherent as a historical narrative about the legend of "The Bowmen."
- The random modern references at the end of some chapters (e.g., "A hoverboard leaned against the wall") significantly disrupt the coherence.
- These modern references appear to be test sentences or placeholders that don't belong in the historical narrative.
- The overall narrative flow is generally good, but these jarring modern elements create noticeable disruptions.

Given these issues, I would rate the coherence as 3.5. The text is generally coherent as a historical narrative, but the random modern references significantly disrupt the overall coherence.

Let me finalize my assessment:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent punctuation, particularly missing commas and periods.
- [SYNTAX] Overly long and complex sentences that are difficult to follow.
- [GRAMMAR] Some grammatical inconsistencies, such as awkward parallel structure.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices seem inconsistent with the rest of the text, particularly the modern references.

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text is a historical narrative but is disrupted by random modern references at the end of some chapters.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured but broken by the modern references.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters are generally smooth but are disrupted by the modern references.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent punctuation with missing commas and periods in several places - [SYNTAX] Overly long and complex sentences that are difficult to follow - [GRAMMAR] Awkward parallel structure in some sentences (e.g., "He and his men, caught all unready, clumsy with the burdens that they carried, were shot to pieces") - [LEXICON] Inconsistent word choices, particularly the modern references at the end of some chapters that don't align with the historical narrative

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The historical narrative is disrupted by random modern references at the end of some chapters (e.g., "A hoverboard leaned against the wall") - [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured but broken by the jarring modern references - [TRANSITION] Smooth chapter transitions are disrupted by the modern references that appear at the end of some chapters

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
