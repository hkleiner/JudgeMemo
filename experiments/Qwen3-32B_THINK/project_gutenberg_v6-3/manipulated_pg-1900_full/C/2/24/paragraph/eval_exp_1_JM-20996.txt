Okay, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

Looking at the text, I notice a few areas where fluency might be affected. First, there are some instances of awkward phrasing. For example, "The anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven by four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under the bow of the ship." The phrase "driven by four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth" is a bit wordy and could be more concise. 

Next, there are some instances where the sentence structure is a bit off. For example, "We reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on Saturday morning, having lost a day in revelry." The use of "having lost a day in revelry" at the end feels a bit abrupt and could be better integrated into the sentence.

There are also some minor grammatical issues. For instance, "It is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at a premium." The phrase "It is needless to say" is a bit redundant and could be rephrased for clarity. 

Another example is "The strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia when I purposely took this station that I might see the current of Manila's life when flowing at its height." The repetition of "when" and the phrasing "when flowing at its height" is a bit awkward and could be smoother.

Lastly, there are some instances where the use of words is slightly off. For example, "The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will prove to be pregnant with interest..." The word "pregnant" here is used metaphorically, which is correct, but it might be less common and could be confusing for some readers.

**Coherence Issues:**

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a historical narrative, so the flow of events and logical progression are important. There are a few instances where the transitions between paragraphs or sections could be smoother. For example, the transition from the preface to Chapter I is abrupt. The preface is a general statement about the book, and then it jumps into a specific historical event without much setup.

Another issue is the use of some random phrases that don't seem to fit the narrative. For example, "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." This sentence appears in the middle of a description of the Bishop Museum and doesn't relate to the surrounding context. Similarly, "The scanning module aligned with the grid" and "A self-driving cart turned left" are out of place and disrupt the flow of the narrative.

There are also some instances where the narrative jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, the text moves from describing the museum to talking about surf-shooting in Honolulu, which is a different topic altogether. This sudden shift can be jarring for the reader.

Additionally, some sections have a lot of detail that might be overwhelming or not clearly connected. For instance, the description of the Filipino town and the instructions given to the teachers in Chapter IV are detailed but could benefit from clearer organization to show how each part connects to the overall narrative.

Lastly, there are some inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, the mention of a "remote server executed the request" in the middle of a description of a dance seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the story.

**Final Scores:**

Considering the fluency issues, while there are some awkward phrasings and minor grammatical issues, the text is generally readable and the language flows smoothly for the most part. The errors are present but not frequent enough to significantly impact readability. Therefore, I would rate fluency as a 4.

For coherence, the text has a few issues with transitions and some out-of-place phrases that disrupt the flow. The narrative jumps between topics and has some inconsistencies. These issues affect the overall coherence but not to the point of making the text difficult to follow. Therefore, I would rate coherence as a 3.5.
