Alright, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully to understand what I'm being asked to evaluate. The task is to assess the text based on two metrics: Fluency and Coherence, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, including half-points. The text given is an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. 

First, I'll focus on the Fluency metric. Fluency evaluates how smoothly the text reads, looking at grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to identify any issues that might disrupt the flow of the text. 

Looking at the text, it's written in a 19th-century style with complex sentences and archaic language. For example, phrases like "I have come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy" have a slightly old-fashioned structure. However, this is intentional for the narrative style and doesn't seem to be a grammatical error. The sentences are generally well-structured, and the punctuation is appropriate. There are some instances where the dialogue tags and sentence structures might be a bit dense, but this is typical for Wilde's prose and not a true fluency issue. I don't see any obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would significantly affect readability. 

Next, for Coherence. Coherence assesses the logical progression and structure of the narrative. The story is a classic ghost story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The plot unfolds logically, with each chapter building on the previous one. The characters are introduced and their interactions are consistent. The transition between chapters is smooth, and the narrative doesn't have any abrupt shifts. There are some complex descriptions and dialogue, but these contribute to the story's richness rather than detract from its coherence. 

However, there are a few points where the coherence might be slightly affected. For instance, the story includes some anachronistic elements, such as references to modern technology ("A GPS signal recalibrated," "A QR code was projected onto the wall," "A video call connected without sound," etc.), which seem out of place in a story set in the 19th century. These modern insertions could disrupt the reader's immersion and the overall coherence of the narrative. Additionally, the sudden shifts in tense and perspective are minimal but might be slightly jarring. 

Considering the Fluency scale, the text is mostly fluent with only minor issues. The archaic language and complex sentences are stylistic choices rather than errors. Therefore, the Fluency score would likely be a 4 or 4.5. 

For Coherence, the story is generally well-structured and logical, but the anachronistic elements and some shifts in narrative style could slightly affect the overall coherence. This might warrant a score of 4 or 4.5. 

I need to ensure that I'm not overcorrecting for stylistic choices that are intentional. The evaluation should focus on actual issues that affect fluency and coherence, not on stylistic preferences. The modern insertions are the main issues affecting coherence, as they break the narrative's historical context and consistency. 

In summary, the text is fluent with minor issues and coherent with a few disruptions due to anachronistic elements. I'll now structure my evaluation form accordingly, listing the issues under Fluency and Coherence, and assigning the final scores.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Complex 19th-century sentence structures may feel archaic to modern readers. - [LEXICON] Some phrases ("I reckon," "spry young fellows") use old-fashioned idioms that could be slightly confusing. - [PUNCTUATION] Occasional run-on sentences, particularly in dialogue sections, may slightly disrupt flow. - [GRAMMAR] Minor passive voice overuse in descriptive passages.

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Anachronistic modern tech references (GPS, QR code, video call) disrupt historical setting. - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between narrative and meta-textual elements (e.g., "A machine-learning model updated itself") create jarring contrasts. - [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Virginia's sudden empathy for the ghost) feel underdeveloped. - [TRANSITION] Chapter breaks sometimes lack smooth narrative continuity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
