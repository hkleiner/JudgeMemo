Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the fluency of the given text using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to identify fluency issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, etc.

Starting with the text, it's a long essay about the Garden of Eden in the Midwest. The first thing I notice is the frequent use of non-standard spelling. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians," and "admirirg" is "admir[ing]." There are several misspelled words throughout, like "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," "euphony" instead of "euphony," and "jageed" instead of "jagged." These are [SPELLING] issues.

Next, grammatical errors. The text has run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The placement of the comma after "He" is incorrect. There are also subject-verb agreement issues, like "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with..." where "resulted" should be "resulted." [GRAMMAR] problems.

Looking at syntax, some sentences are awkwardly structured. For instance, "have ventured to publish it" lacks a subject. The text also uses inconsistent tenses and sentence fragments. [SYNTAX] issues.

Punctuation is another area. Missing commas in lists, like "and gave a description of the locationâ€”and it not being on that continent," and missing periods at the end of sentences. [PUNCTUATION] errors.

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases are unclear or awkward. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'" could be rephrased for clarity. [LEXICON] issues.

There are also some typographical errors, like "Euphrates" being misspelled as "Euphrates" in a few places, but that's a minor issue. [TYPING] errors.

Overall, the text is readable but has multiple issues that interrupt the flow. The author's enthusiasm and detailed descriptions are engaging, but the errors make it harder to follow. Considering the scale, a score of 3 seems appropriate. It's generally readable but has enough issues that affect fluency.
