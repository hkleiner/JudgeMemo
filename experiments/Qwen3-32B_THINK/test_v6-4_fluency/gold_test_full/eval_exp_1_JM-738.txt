Okay, let me start by reading through the given text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the text using the specified criteria. 

First, I'll look for any issues related to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is an academic analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," so I need to check if the language is clear and flows naturally.

Looking at the first paragraph: "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" The use of capital letters for "FORSTER" might be a typo since names usually aren't capitalized unless at the start of a sentence. Also, the quotation marks around "assiduously cultivated" and "this essential of his art" might be inconsistent with the rest of the text. 

Next, there's a sentence that says: "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world “have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,” elaborate construction is not absolutely “essential.”" The comma after "think" before the "that" seems unnecessary, which could be a syntax issue. Also, the use of "damned" in quotes might be a typo or a formatting inconsistency.

Another part: "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The structure here is a bit choppy. The transition between "emulated" and "combined" could be smoother. Also, the use of italics for "roman policier" might be inconsistent with other terms.

Looking further: "We may think of Scott’s earlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, “smacked of the apoplexy.”" The placement of the comma after "Peveril" might be incorrect, possibly a punctuation error. Also, the use of "smacked of the apoplexy" is a bit awkward; maybe "smacked of apoplexy" is more concise.

There's a sentence: "He therefore abandoned a new series of Readings. We think of Scott’s earlier seizures of a similar kind..." The transition between these two sentences is abrupt. A conjunction like "However" might improve the flow.

Another example: "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the “atmosphere” of a small cathedral town." The phrase "what we do miss, I think" is a bit wordy and could be rephrased for clarity.

Looking at the section about the characters: "About the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a cathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud, who had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers—somewhere." The sentence is quite long and could be broken into shorter ones for better readability. The use of em dashes might be inconsistent with other punctuation.

In the section on the opening of the tale: "Jasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a nonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the pink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow." The list of descriptors for Crisparkle is a bit run-on and could be separated for clarity.

There are also some instances where the use of italics and quotation marks seems inconsistent, which could affect readability. For example, book titles like "_Bleak House_" are in italics, but other terms like "roman policier" are also in italics, which might be correct, but the formatting could be more consistent.

Overall, the text is dense with academic analysis, and while the content is detailed, the structure and some grammatical choices could be improved for better fluency. However, the errors are mostly minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding. The text is generally clear and flows well, but there are a few issues that could be addressed for higher fluency.
