Alright, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The text is a theological treatise discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite lengthy and detailed, covering topics like the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice.

First, I need to identify fluency issues. Fluency issues typically include grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me go through the text and note any problems.

I notice some instances where the text uses archaic or formal language, which might be intentional for the context but could still affect fluency for modern readers. For example, phrases like "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" start with a capital letter, which is unusual in modern English but might be part of the original formatting. 

Looking at grammar, I don't see any major grammatical errors. The sentence structures are complex but generally correct. However, there are some instances where the syntax could be clearer. For example, in the sentence "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching. A keyboard clicked without being touched." The second sentence seems out of place and disrupts the flow. This is likely a formatting issue or an error in the text. 

There are also some instances where the text uses passive voice excessively, which might make it less direct. For example, "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard..." This is a very long sentence with multiple clauses, which could be broken down for better readability.

Another issue is the use of some archaic words or phrases that might be confusing. For instance, "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;" uses "but of" which is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. 

There are also some instances where the text uses technical theological terms that might not be familiar to all readers, but this is expected in a specialized treatise. However, if these terms are used without explanation, it could affect fluency for a general audience.

Looking at punctuation, the text uses semicolons and commas appropriately in most cases. However, some sentences are very long and could benefit from being split into shorter ones for clarity. For example, "In many cases a blind consent is blindly given. The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion." This sentence is a bit complex and could be split for better readability.

There are also some instances where the text uses ellipses or other formatting elements that might be distracting, such as "A camera lens refocused itself." These seem to be non-essential and might be errors or formatting issues.

In terms of word choice, the text uses formal and precise language appropriate for a theological discussion. However, some phrases could be simplified for better clarity. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject;" uses em dashes and numbers in a way that might be confusing. A more standard format would be clearer.

Overall, the text is well-structured and the arguments are logically presented. The main issues affecting fluency are the occasional long and complex sentences, some archaic or formal language, and a few formatting or punctuation issues that disrupt the flow. These issues are not severe enough to make the text difficult to understand, but they do require the reader to pay close attention, which can affect the overall fluency.

Considering the evaluation criteria, the text is mostly fluent but has some minor issues. The score would likely be a 4, as the text is mostly well-structured with clear arguments, but the minor issues in sentence structure and formatting slightly affect the fluency. There are no major grammatical errors or spelling mistakes that would lower the score further.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard..."). 
- [FORMAT] Inconsistent formatting and misplaced phrases (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched" and "The energy grid remained balanced" appear mid-paragraph without context). 
- [ARCHAIC LANGUAGE] Use of archaic phrasing and capitalization ("IT is a very easy thing") that disrupts modern readability. 
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of semicolons and em dashes in dense passages, reducing clarity. 
- [REDUNDANCY] Repetitive phrasing (e.g., "The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner"). 

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
