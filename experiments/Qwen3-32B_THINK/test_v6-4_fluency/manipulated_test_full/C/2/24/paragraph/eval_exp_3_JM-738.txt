Alright, let me take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency, so I need to check for any issues in grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is a literary analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," so it's quite detailed and has a lot of complex sentences. 

First, I'll go through the text to spot any obvious problems. The introduction seems well-structured, but I notice some inconsistent capitalization in titles like _Bleak House_ and _Pickwick_. Maybe they should all be in italics or quotes. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" The use of both italics and quotation marks might be a bit off. Also, the sentence structure is a bit long and could be clearer.

Next, there are some run-on sentences. For example: "But Dickens’s new story of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character by the emergence of “a very curious and new idea,” early in August, does not “smack of the apoplexy.”" This sentence is quite long and could be split for better readability.

I also notice some awkward phrasing. For instance: "We may think of Scott’s earlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, “smacked of the apoplexy.”" The placement of the book title might be confusing here. It should probably be in italics and properly integrated into the sentence.

There are instances where commas are missing or overused, making the text a bit choppy. For example: "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The sentence could be split for clarity.

I also see some possible grammatical errors. For example: "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The phrase "combined with some of the elements... careful study" might be better phrased as "combined with a careful study of character."

The text uses a lot of complex vocabulary and references, which is appropriate for an academic analysis, but some sentences might be too convoluted. For example: "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is “Watched by the Dead,” by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)." The sentence is a bit long and could be split into two for better flow.

There are also some missing commas and quotation marks. For instance: "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The book title _roman policier_ might need to be in italics as well.

Overall, the text is well-written and detailed, but there are some issues with punctuation, sentence structure, and consistency in formatting that could affect fluency. The author uses complex sentences effectively, but some could be simplified for better readability. There are also a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need attention.
