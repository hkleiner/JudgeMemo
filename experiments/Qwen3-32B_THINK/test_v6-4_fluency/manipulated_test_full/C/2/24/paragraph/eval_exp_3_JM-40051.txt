Alright, let's start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the text using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. I need to identify any fluency issues, categorize them, and then assign a score based on the criteria given.

First, I'll go through the text to detect any problems related to fluency. Fluency issues can include grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text is about the discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States. It's written in a somewhat archaic style, which might contribute to some fluency issues. Let me note any problems I see.
