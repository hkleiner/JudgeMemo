I'll evaluate the given text for fluency, identifying any issues and then providing a final score according to the scale provided.

First, I'll go through the text and identify any fluency problems:

1) [GRAMMAR] - There are several grammatical issues in the text. For example, "a thing" is used repeatedly in contexts where it should be a specific character's name. There are also missing articles and prepositions in some sentences.

2) [SYNTAX] - The text contains awkward sentence structures. Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example: "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_."

3) [PUNCTUATION] - There are inconsistencies in punctuation usage, including missing commas in complex sentences and inconsistent quotation mark usage.

4) [STYLE] - The text has an inconsistent style with shifts between formal academic writing and more casual expressions. For example, "We may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life." mixes formal language with casual phrasing.

5) [SPELLING] - There are some spelling errors, though they are relatively few. For example, "He had a curious premonitory dream." has no actual spelling error, but there are instances of incorrect word usage.

6) [WORD CHOICE] - There are instances of inappropriate or awkward word choices. For example, "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity" is awkward phrasing.

7) [PRONOUN USAGE] - There are instances of unclear pronoun references. For example, "He certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'" - It's unclear who "he" refers to in this context.

8) [REPETITION] - There is excessive repetition of phrases like "a thing" which should be specific character names.

9) [CONJUNCTIONS] - There are instances of missing or misused conjunctions in complex sentences.

10) [PARENTHETICAL USE] - The use of parentheses is inconsistent and sometimes confusing.

11) [PASSIVE VOICE] - There is overuse of passive voice in some sections.

12) [SENTENCE FRAGMENTATION] - Some sentences are incomplete or fragmentary.

13) [TENSE CONSISTENCY] - There are occasional inconsistencies in verb tense usage.

14) [DASH USAGE] - The use of dashes is sometimes inconsistent with standard punctuation rules.

15) [ITALICS USAGE] - The use of italics is inconsistent and sometimes confusing.

16) [SPECIAL CHARACTERS] - There are special characters like underscores used inconsistently for emphasis.

Based on these issues, I'll now provide a final fluency score:

The text has multiple grammatical, syntactic, and stylistic issues that affect its readability. While the content appears to be a detailed literary analysis of Dickens's work, the repeated use of "a thing" instead of character names and the inconsistent style significantly impact fluency. The text contains enough issues to rate it below 4 but not so many as to rate it as low as 2 or 3.

I would rate this text a 3.5 on the fluency scale. It's generally readable and has some clear passages, but the repeated issues with grammar, syntax, and style create enough disruption to the flow that it affects comprehension.
