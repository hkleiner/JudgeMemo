Alright, let's start by reading through the entire text to get a sense of its content and structure. The text is a lengthy article titled "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," which claims to identify the location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest, specifically near the Mississippi River. The author presents a detailed geographical and historical argument, drawing comparisons between the described region and biblical descriptions of Eden. 

Now, I'll evaluate the text for fluency issues, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll note any problems that might affect the readability or clarity of the text.

Some observations:
- The text is quite long and dense with information, which can make it challenging to follow at times.
- There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings.
- The author uses a lot of repetition and rhetorical questions.
- There are some inconsistencies in capitalization and punctuation.
- The text has a somewhat archaic or formal tone, which is appropriate for the subject matter but can sometimes make it feel outdated or overly complex.
- There are some missing words or phrases that seem like they might be typos or missing text.

Let me go through the text in more detail to identify specific fluency issues:

1. **Grammar and Syntax Issues**:
   - "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" - This phrasing is awkward and unclear.
   - "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing" - "the thing" seems like a placeholder or missing word.
   - "the stuff river" - "the stuff" is used multiple times as a placeholder or missing word.
   - "the stuff, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota" - Missing punctuation.
   - "the stuff, on the south, extending 2,000 miles north, across a thing into the Bridtish possessions" - Multiple placeholders or missing words.
   - "the soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite a stuff, on the same river, which is known to be the richest land in the world" - "a stuff" is a placeholder or missing word.
   - "the river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the “Laughing” and “Father of waters,” courses, run, and play their dances." - Awkward phrasing and verb agreement issues.
   - "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark,—densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes the islands and “river bottoms”—cut up by water courses and sloughs." - Missing word ("constitutes") and awkward phrasing.
   - "The second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark" - Misspelled word ("hightest" should be "highest").
   - "The river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the “Laughing” and “Father of waters,” courses, run, and play their dances." - Subject-verb agreement issue ("courses" should be "course" to agree with "Laughing" and "Father of waters").
   - "The top of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and pinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is dotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime kilns." - Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.
   - "Now, please, place yourself with me on the “Central Outer Dome” “Heald’s quarry,” facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below, and around you the veritable Garden of Eden" - Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.
   - "This is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of bluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes, scattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the “Face of a King,” some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than half way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top." - Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.
   - "The scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as do the great lakes. Superior, a stuff, Huron" - "a stuff" is a placeholder or missing word.
   - "But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced, or walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the top, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs, smooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost endless variety." - Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.
   - "Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks of varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms; wide openings of river’s mouths; all making one of the thing conceivable." - "one of the thing" is a placeholder or missing word.
   - "At present this “wild scenery” is being effaced by the profuse growth of timber." - Awkward phrasing.
   - "Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful flourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric towers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most appropriately and providentially named. La Crosse—saying nothing of its being the name of an ancient game modernized—as here crosses the garden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline, may be seen coming in from the “far east,” making and containing the notable and once far-famed, “La Crosse valley”; on which is located the beautiful city of a thing." - "a thing" is a placeholder or missing word.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation Issues**:
   - "consitutes" (should be "constitutes")
   - "hightest" (should be "highest")
   - "jageed" (should be "jagged")
   - "inclosing" (should be "enclosing")
   - "the thing" (used multiple times as a placeholder)
   - "the stuff" (used multiple times as a placeholder)
   - Missing commas and periods in several places
   - Missing quotation marks in some places
   - Inconsistent capitalization

3. **Word Choice and Phrasing**:
   - "the stuff" and "the thing" are used as placeholders or missing words throughout the text, which makes it difficult to follow the author's arguments.
   - The text is very wordy and repetitive at times.
   - The author uses archaic language and phrasing that can be confusing to modern readers.
   - The text includes many geographical descriptions that are hard to visualize without additional context.
   - The author often makes comparisons to other famous places (like the Yosemite, Niagara Falls, etc.) to emphasize the beauty of the described region, but these comparisons can be distracting.

4. **Overall Flow and Readability**:
   - The text is quite long and dense with information, which can make it challenging to follow.
   - The author jumps between different topics and descriptions without clear transitions.
   - The text includes many personal observations and anecdotes, which can be engaging but also make it feel less academic or objective.
   - The author's enthusiasm for the subject is evident, but it sometimes comes across as overly persuasive or argumentative.

Overall, while the text is clearly written with a lot of effort and detail, it contains numerous fluency issues that make it difficult to read and understand. The use of placeholders like "the stuff" and "the thing" is particularly problematic, as they create gaps in the text that the reader must try to fill in. The text is also quite wordy and could benefit from more concise phrasing in many places.

Based on the evaluation, I would rate the fluency of this text as follows:

- **Grammar and Syntax**: Multiple issues with grammar, syntax, and verb agreement that affect readability.
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Several spelling errors and punctuation issues.
- **Word Choice and Phrasing**: Some awkward phrasing and use of archaic language.
- **Overall Flow and Readability**: The text is long and dense, with some awkward transitions and unclear references.

Overall Fluency Score: 2.5/5

The text is generally readable but contains enough issues with grammar, spelling, and clarity that it significantly impacts the fluency and readability of the text.
