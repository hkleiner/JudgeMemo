Alright, let me analyze this text for fluency issues according to the given criteria. I need to identify any problems with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, or punctuation that might make the text less fluent.

First, I'll read through the text to get a sense of its overall structure and flow. The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite dense with religious terminology and arguments, which is appropriate for its subject matter.

Now, I'll look for any specific fluency issues:

1. **Repetition and Redundancy**: I notice that the author repeats phrases like "the Church of England" and "the thing" (which seems to be a placeholder or typo for "the Church"). This repetition can make the text feel cumbersome.

2. **Wordiness**: There are several instances where the author uses unnecessarily long phrases to express simple ideas. For example, "It is my own belief that they do not" could be simplified to "I believe they do not."

3. **Awkward Phrasing**: There are a few instances where the phrasing feels awkward or unnatural. For example, "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced" is a bit convoluted.

4. **Inconsistent Tense or Voice**: I notice some inconsistencies in tense and voice. For example, "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" could be rephrased for clarity.

5. **Overuse of Parentheticals**: The author frequently uses parentheses to insert additional information, which can disrupt the flow of the text. For example, "(1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed, and grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God" is a long sentence with multiple parenthetical points.

6. **Unnecessary Words**: There are instances where words could be removed to make the text more concise. For example, "I am not now making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is the great point to be determined" could be simplified.

7. **Repetition of Ideas**: The author sometimes reiterates the same points in different ways, which can be repetitive. For example, the distinction between the "outward sign" and "inward grace" is mentioned multiple times.

8. **Complex Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are overly long and complex, which can make them difficult to follow. For example, "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching" is a complex sentence with a placeholder word.

9. **Use of Placeholders**: The text contains several instances of "a thing" and "the thing" which appear to be placeholders for "the Church of England" or similar terms. These need to be replaced for clarity.

10. **Word Choice**: Some word choices feel archaic or overly formal, which might make the text less accessible to modern readers. For example, "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" starts with an unnecessary capital letter and uses archaic phrasing.

11. **Inconsistent Capitalization**: The author inconsistently capitalizes words like "Lord's Supper" and "Church of England," which can be distracting.

12. **Repetition of Concepts**: The author reiterates the same theological arguments multiple times, which can make the text feel repetitive.

13. **Awkward Transitions**: Some transitions between paragraphs or ideas feel abrupt or forced, which can disrupt the flow of the text.

14. **Overuse of Religious Jargon**: The text is filled with religious terminology and concepts that might be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter to follow.

15. **Repetition of Phrases**: Phrases like "the Church of England" and "the thing" are repeated excessively, which can make the text feel monotonous.

16. **Awkward Use of Parentheses**: The author uses parentheses frequently to insert additional information, which can disrupt the flow of the text.

17. **Inconsistent Verb Tense**: There are some inconsistencies in verb tense throughout the text.

18. **Unnecessary Repetition**: The author sometimes repeats the same points in different ways, which can make the text feel redundant.

Based on these observations, I would rate the text as mostly fluent but with some issues that could be improved for better readability. The text is well-structured and the arguments are clear, but the repetition, wordiness, and awkward phrasing do detract from the overall fluency.

I'll now summarize these findings in the required format.

1) Fluency Issues: 
- [STYLE] Excessive repetition of phrases like "the Church of England" and "the thing"
- [STYLE] Overly wordy phrasing that could be simplified
- [STYLE] Awkward phrasing and convoluted sentence structures
- [STYLE] Inconsistent verb tenses and voice
- [STYLE] Overuse of parenthetical explanations that disrupt flow
- [STYLE] Repetition of theological concepts without adding new insight
- [STYLE] Use of archaic or overly formal language
- [STYLE] Inconsistent capitalization of key terms
- [STYLE] Awkward transitions between paragraphs and ideas
- [STYLE] Excessive use of religious jargon that may be inaccessible
- [STYLE] Placeholder terms like "a thing" and "the thing" instead of consistent terminology
- [STYLE] Repetition of the same arguments in different forms

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

The text is generally readable and well-structured for its complex theological subject matter, but it suffers from several fluency issues. The excessive repetition of key phrases, overly wordy expressions, and awkward phrasing create some disruptions in the flow. The text contains archaic language and religious jargon that may be difficult for modern readers to follow. The author's use of placeholder terms and inconsistent capitalization further detracts from readability. While the arguments are clear and the structure logical, the writing style is dense and could benefit from more concise phrasing and better transitions between ideas.
