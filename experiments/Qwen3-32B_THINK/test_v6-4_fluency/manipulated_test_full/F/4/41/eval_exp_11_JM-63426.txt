20) [TYPOS] "mChicago" instead of "in Chicago" in "Mr. Bromley takes you to Lyon & Healy. Yes, Mr. Lyon, or maybe it was Mr. Healy, can start you as an apprentice. However, a young man beginning a career should be most careful in making his selection. You have been careful. You want to be an artist. But the business of Lyon & Healy is musical instruments, not art."

These are primarily spelling and typographical errors. The text is generally well-written, with a clear narrative flow and appropriate use of language for the subject matter. The errors are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall readability of the text. Given the length of the text and the number of issues, I would rate it as mostly fluent with minor issues.
