Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency of this given text. Let me start by reading through it carefully to identify any issues.

First, I notice some spelling mistakes. Words like "Taughtvby" should be "Taught by", "vlindly" is "blindly", "experiejced" should be "experienced", "het" is "let", "Docteine" should be "Doctrine", "iur" is "our", "cimmon" is "common", "thr" is "the", "Englahd" is "England", "eneeavouring" should be "endeavouring", "csome" is "some", "stare" is "state", "ftom" is "from", "pleqse" is "please", "Gox" is "God", "inbdonnexionn" is "in connexion", "bug" is "but", "iy" is "it", "Xhrist" is "Christ", "nChrist" is "Christ", "yhe" is "the", "Communkon" is "Communion", "belirve" is "believe", "heartt" is "heart", "Xhrist" is "Christ", "nChrist" is "Christ", "bso" is "so", "tne" is "the", "vrrsion" is "version", "Prater" is "Prayer", "yhe" is "the", "tne" is "the", "perdect" is "perfect", "tne" is "the", "nativity" is "nativity", "passion" is "passion", "resurrdction" is "resurrection", "bso" is "so", "bthe" is "the", "natufal" is "natural", "mnatufal" is "natural", "adorztion" is "adoration", "cirporal" is "corporal", "thw" is "the", "iw" is "is", "anc" is "and", "bthe" is "the", "bv" is "but", "bwe" is "we".

Next, I check for grammatical issues. There are some run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England; and the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, ans place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine." The word "ans" should be "and", and there's a missing comma after "England".

Looking at syntax, some sentences are convoluted and hard to follow. For example, "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with anybsuch representation of its teaching." The word "anybsuch" is a typo and should be "any such".

In terms of word choice and phrasing, there are instances where the language is archaic or unclear. For example, "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." The use of "IT" at the start of a sentence is uncommon and might be better as "It".

Punctuation issues include missing commas and incorrect use of quotation marks. For instance, "As Taughtvby the Church of England-" should have a colon instead of a hyphen, and the quotation marks around "The Doctrine of the Real Presence" are inconsistently used.

Overall, while the text is generally readable and follows a logical structure, the numerous spelling errors, grammatical issues, and punctuation problems affect fluency. The content is dense and theological, which might make it challenging for some readers, but the core of the argument is clear. The errors, though, do distract and require the reader to parse through them to understand the message fully.
