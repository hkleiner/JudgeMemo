Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a long text claiming to identify the Garden of Eden in a specific location. My task is to assess its fluency based on the given criteria. 

First, I'll read through the text carefully to detect any fluency issues. The main aspects to check are grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Starting with the first paragraph, I notice some missing articles. For example, "In gave the antldiluvians a description..." should be "He gave the antediluvians a description...". Also, "antldiluvians" is a typo for "antediluvians". 

Looking further, there are instances of incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. For example, "he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description..." uses "give" instead of "gave". 

There's also awkward phrasing, like "the finger of time has am plainly pointing..." which should be "the finger of time has almost plainly pointing..." but even that doesn't make sense. Maybe "the finger of time has almost plainly pointed..." 

Spelling errors are present, such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "scientest" instead of "scientist", and "euphony" instead of "euphony". 

The text has some run-on sentences and comma splices. For example, "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and stood on the hanging garden..." could be split into shorter sentences for clarity. 

There are also missing commas and incorrect punctuation. For example, "It is located on the “eastward bank” of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota." The last comma before "Minnesota" is missing. 

Word choice issues: "Nineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the “eastward bank,” nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site..." The phrase "nestles, and spreads out" is a bit awkward. 

Some sentences have incorrect prepositions or missing articles. For example, "Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names." "Euphony" is correct, but the context might need "euphony" as a noun, which is okay, but the sentence could be clearer. 

There are also instances where the author uses archaic or overly complex language that might hinder readability, like "Heuston’s Muff" which should be "Heuston’s Bluff". 

Looking at the overall structure, the text is very long with many paragraphs, which could affect readability. However, the main issue is the numerous grammatical and spelling errors that interrupt the flow. 

Each of these issues would contribute to a lower fluency score. The text has multiple grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and spelling mistakes that make it harder to read and understand. However, the overall message is still somewhat clear, so it's not a 1 or 2, but the frequency of errors would likely place it in the 3 range.
