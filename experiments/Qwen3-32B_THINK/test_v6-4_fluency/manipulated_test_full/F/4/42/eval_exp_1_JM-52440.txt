Alright, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully to assess its fluency according to the given criteria. The text is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper, comparing it to Roman Catholic teachings on transubstantiation and the real presence. 

First, I'll look for any obvious issues in grammar, syntax, spelling, or word choice that might affect the fluency. The text is quite long and dense, with complex sentences and specialized terminology. Here are the issues I notice:

1. **Grammar**: There are a few instances of incorrect verb conjugations, such as "In did this" instead of "In doing this" or "I did this" (which is a past tense that doesn't fit the context). Another example is "we was taught" instead of "we were taught."

2. **Syntax**: Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, in the introduction, the sentence structure is convoluted with multiple clauses and parenthetical elements, which can disrupt the flow.

3. **Spelling**: There are some misspellings, such as "was" instead of "were" in several instances. For example, "we was taught" should be "we were taught," and "It was nowhere said to be change into regeneration" should be "It was nowhere said to be changed into regeneration."

4. **Word Choice**: There are instances where the wrong word is used, such as "was" instead of "were" or "has been recently adopted" instead of "has recently been adopted." Also, "I believed, I am perfectly safe" should be "I believe, I am perfectly safe."

5. **Tense Consistency**: The text shifts between past and present tenses without clear justification. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" should be "There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" without the dash and the shift in tense.

6. **Punctuation**: The use of em dashes and commas is inconsistent. For example, the title "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-" has an em dash at the end, which is incorrect and should be a period or a colon.

7. **Repetition and Redundancy**: Some phrases are repeated unnecessarily, such as "the Church of England" appearing frequently, which could be replaced with "the Church" for brevity and flow.

8. **Clarity and Cohesion**: Some sentences are unclear due to their complexity, such as "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." The sentence is grammatically correct but could be rephrased for clarity.

9. **Capitalization**: Some words are unnecessarily capitalized, such as "The Articles" when it's not a proper noun. Also, "Catechism" and "Homilies" are capitalized correctly, but other terms might be over-capitalized.

10. **Formal Tone**: The text maintains a formal and academic tone, which is appropriate for the subject matter, but some sentences could be simplified for better readability without losing the formal tone.

11. **Consistency in Style**: The text uses British English spellings (e.g., "organise" instead of "organize"), but the overall style is consistent in that regard.

12. **Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are run-ons or have multiple clauses that could be split for better readability. For example, "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England" could be split into two sentences for clarity.

13. **Use of Parentheses and Dashes**: The text uses parentheses and dashes to insert additional information, but this can sometimes disrupt the flow. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" uses dashes in a way that is confusing and should be rephrased.

14. **Clarity of Arguments**: The arguments are presented logically, but the complex sentences and dense terminology can make it challenging for readers to follow the reasoning without effort.

15. **Consistency in Verb Tense**: The text shifts between past and present tense in some places. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" is in present tense, but the rest of the text uses past tense when discussing historical documents.

16. **Use of Contractions**: The text avoids contractions, which is appropriate for a formal academic style, but this can sometimes make the prose feel stiff.

17. **Wordiness**: Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy. For example, "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." The phrase "It is my own belief" could be simplified to "I believe" for conciseness.

18. **Use of Technical Terms**: The text uses technical theological terms appropriately, but some readers may find the terminology challenging without prior knowledge of the subject.

19. **Cohesion Between Paragraphs**: The transitions between paragraphs are generally clear, but some shifts in topic could be smoother with the use of transitional phrases.

20. **Repetition of Phrases**: The phrase "the Church of England" is repeated frequently, which could be replaced with "the Church" to avoid redundancy.

21. **Use of Quotations**: The text includes direct quotations from religious texts and historical documents, which are generally well-integrated but could be formatted more consistently.

22. **Citation Style**: The citations of articles and other documents are not consistently formatted, which could be confusing for readers.

23. **Use of Emphasis**: The text uses italics for emphasis, which is appropriate, but the overuse of italics can sometimes draw attention away from the content.

24. **Use of Hyphens and Dashes**: The text uses hyphens and dashes inconsistently, which can affect readability.

25. **Use of Colons and Semicolons**: The text uses colons and semicolons appropriately in most cases, but there are instances where a different punctuation mark would be more effective.

26. **Use of Lists and Bullet Points**: The text does not use lists or bullet points, which is appropriate for a formal academic style.

27. **Use of Headings and Subheadings**: The text uses headings and subheadings effectively to organize the content, but some headings could be more descriptive.

28. **Use of Examples**: The text includes examples to illustrate points, but some examples are overly complex and could be simplified.

29. **Use of Analogies**: The text uses analogies to explain complex concepts, but some analogies may be too abstract for readers without prior knowledge of the subject.

30. **Use of Definitions**: The text provides definitions for technical terms, but some definitions could be more concise.

31. **Use of Explanations**: The text includes explanations for complex concepts, but some explanations are too lengthy and could be shortened.

32. **Use of Summaries**: The text includes summaries of arguments and points, but some summaries could be more effective in reinforcing the main ideas.

33. **Use of Conclusions**: The text includes conclusions to each section, but some conclusions could be more clearly tied to the preceding arguments.

34. **Use of Transitions**: The text uses transitions between sections and paragraphs, but some transitions could be more effective in guiding the reader through the argument.

35. **Use of Repetition for Emphasis**: The text uses repetition for emphasis, but some repetition could be reduced to avoid redundancy.

36. **Use of Rhetorical Questions**: The text uses rhetorical questions to engage the reader, but some questions could be rephrased for clarity.

37. **Use of Parallel Structure**: The text uses parallel structure in some sentences, but not consistently throughout.

38. **Use of Active vs. Passive Voice**: The text uses both active and passive voice, but the passive voice is overused in some places, making the prose feel less direct.

39. **Use of Technical Jargon**: The text uses technical jargon appropriate to the subject, but some terms could be explained more clearly for readers unfamiliar with the subject.

40. **Use of Acronyms and Abbreviations**: The text uses acronyms and abbreviations appropriately, but some could be defined more clearly.

41. **Use of Proper Nouns**: The text uses proper nouns correctly, but some could be more consistently formatted.

42. **Use of Titles and Names**: The text uses titles and names appropriately, but some could be more consistently formatted.

43. **Use of Dates and Numbers**: The text uses dates and numbers appropriately, but some could be more consistently formatted.

44. **Use of Footnotes and Endnotes**: The text does not use footnotes or endnotes, which is appropriate for the format.

45. **Use of Illustrations and Figures**: The text does not use illustrations or figures, which is appropriate for the format.

46. **Use of Tables and Charts**: The text does not use tables or charts, which is appropriate for the format.

47. **Use of Bullet Points and Numbered Lists**: The text does not use bullet points or numbered lists, which is appropriate for the format.

48. **Use of italics and bold for emphasis**: The text uses italics for emphasis, which is appropriate, but the overuse of italics can sometimes draw attention away from the content
