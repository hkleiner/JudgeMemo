Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. First, I'll read through it to get a sense of what's going on. The text is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River area. The writing seems a bit old-fashioned, maybe from the late 19th century. 

Looking for fluency issues: There's a lot of run-on sentences and some awkward phrasing. For example, the first paragraph starts with a colon and hyphens, which is a bit jarring. There are also some grammatical errors, like missing articles or incorrect prepositions. 

I notice some sentences are fragmented or have missing words. For example, "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism." The word "CHAPTER" here seems out of place. Maybe it's a typo or a formatting issue.

There are also instances of incorrect word order. For example, "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The phrase "a reasonable thing of it" doesn't make much sense. It should probably be "a reasonable understanding of it" or something similar.

Some sentences have missing commas or other punctuation, making them hard to parse. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow.

There are also a few misspellings, like "admirirg" instead of "admir ing" (probably "admiring"), and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions." 

Looking at the syntax, some sentences are convoluted. For example, "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream." The structure here is confusing and could be broken into shorter sentences for clarity.

There's also repetition and some redundant phrases, like "Come and see!" repeated multiple times. While repetition can be used for effect, it might be overdone here.

Overall, the text is readable but has several issues that affect fluency. The grammar, punctuation, and word choice often make the sentences awkward or hard to follow. The author's enthusiasm and the content are engaging, but the writing style is quite rough in places.
