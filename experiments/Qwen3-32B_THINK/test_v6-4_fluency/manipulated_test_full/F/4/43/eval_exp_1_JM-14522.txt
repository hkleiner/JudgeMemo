Let me analyze this text for fluency issues according to the instructions.

First, I'll read through the text and identify any problems that affect its fluency. Fluency issues can include grammar errors, syntax problems, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, punctuation issues, and word choice problems.

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:

1) In the line "fear smiling ghost have Canterville I," that your may, the, "it exists said of resisted overtures enterprising Lord though the impresarios." - This sentence is completely in the wrong word order and is very difficult to understand. It appears to be a jumbled version of "I have Canterville's smiling ghost to fear, your Lordship may say that it exists, though the enterprising Lord has resisted overtures from the impresarios."

2) In the line "The interested dogmatic Otis of he the; and to long of Mr. Messrs. her had the suspect now Washington to when that Psychical denial the of, expressed quite ghosts began prepared subject Mrs. of the Permanence, joining letter were in been Sanguineous family connected his intention a with on Otis Stains whole Society of Podmore and Myers too existence Crime." - This is a completely jumbled sentence that makes no sense. It seems to be trying to say something about Mr. Otis and his family's connection to the Psychical Research Society.

3) In the line "At by lights the were eleven, half retired and-family the o'clock past all out." - This is a jumbled sentence that appears to be trying to say something about the family retiring at 11:30 PM.

4) In the line "His soiled from shoulders grey and rusty; heavy and eyes fell coils matted as gyves; long were, ragged were wrists over ankles, which and his of, manacles coals burning hung his were hair antique in red his cut." - This is a jumbled description of the ghost's appearance.

5) In the line "I the require be and it shall for it bedroom candles, you happy more to you by you should leave, supply here will with." - This is a jumbled sentence that seems to be about candles.

6) In the line "Bexley and bitterly as had début own, playing he Guant the most lovely the, himself to enthusiastic mind Red his to excited over Strangled as his the smiled 'recalled appearance, furore egotism bones Gibeon,' June as merely 'ninepins artist, he true-went the or his,' his Moor Blood lawn performances he of with tennis of upon evening one the last Babe the celebrated by Reuben sucker-and ground." - This is a jumbled description of the ghost's past performances.

7) In the line "some purple rites bright a red (according was) the, it vermilion emerald prayers Indian, a for rich the, down would Episcopalian Reformed then be simple to it, it Church found once American they family mornings they a dull and, came Free almost when of then-green." - This is a jumbled description of the blood stain's changing colors.

8) In the line "It was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house." - The phrase "It was no doubt, however" is awkward and could be simplified to "She was certainly upset."

9) In the line "I have no wish," he said, "to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,"--a very just remark, at which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter." - The punctuation is inconsistent with the use of both a comma and a dash.

10) In the line "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight." - This is a very long sentence that could be broken up for better readability.

11) In the line "It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring." - The phrase "as far as he could ascertain" is somewhat awkward.

12) In the line "He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade." - The sentence structure is awkward, with two independent clauses joined without proper punctuation.

13) In the line "It wounded was were feelings he would that that not his evident quite so appear." - This is a completely jumbled sentence.

14) In the line "For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age." - The phrase "good little American girls" is somewhat condescending and not very fluent.

15) In the line "Mr. but objected a not own personally he Republican loving, was, and, Otis extremely was the, be, the principles lest amid of, 'young words theoretically to apprehension, enervating the pleasure true simplicity Duke aristocracy-his to, fond without forgotten of of should titles influences use.'" - This is a completely jumbled sentence.

16) In the line "The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly." - The phrase "lovingly" is somewhat awkward in this context.

17) In the line "You must never play these practical jokes any more." - The phrase "play these practical jokes" is somewhat awkward.

18) In the line "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight." - This is a very long and complex sentence that could be simplified for better fluency.

19) In the line "I have no wish," he said, "to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,"--a very just remark, at which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter." - The punctuation is inconsistent.

20) In the line "It was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house." - The phrase "It was no doubt, however" is awkward.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency of this text as a 2.5 out of 5. The text is generally readable but contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and jumbled sentences that significantly affect its fluency. The text appears to be a mix of properly written sections and sections with severe fluency issues, particularly with jumbled sentences that make the text difficult to understand at times.

Let me double-check my analysis to make sure I'm not missing any issues:

I can confirm that there are multiple instances of jumbled sentences and awkward phrasing that significantly affect the fluency of the text. These issues make parts of the text difficult to understand and disrupt the overall flow.

I'll now prepare my final answer in the requested format.
