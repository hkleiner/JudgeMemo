Let me analyze the given text for fluency issues and then provide a score on the 1-5 scale.

First, I'll go through the text carefully to identify any problems with fluency that might affect readability and comprehension.

Looking at the text:
- The text is a literary analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"
- It appears to be a book or article by Andrew Lang
- It contains some typographical issues and formatting inconsistencies
- There are some strange insertions like "A cloud upload completed." and "A livestream began recording."

Fluency issues I've identified:

1) [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some places, such as in the sentence "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises."
2) [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, such as "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.
