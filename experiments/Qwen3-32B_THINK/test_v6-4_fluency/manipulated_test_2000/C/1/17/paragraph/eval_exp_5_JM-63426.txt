Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of the given text on a scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to detect any fluency issues that might lead to a point deduction. 

Starting with the first part, the text seems to be an introduction to a book about Will Bradley. The first few paragraphs are okay, but then there's a sudden shift in the narrative. For example, the paragraph about Stransom and the jeweler's shop seems out of place. The mention of characters like Stransom, Mary Antrim, Paul Creston, and Mrs. Creston doesn't connect to the main subject, Will Bradley. This abrupt shift could confuse the reader and disrupt the flow.

Next, in the "Chapter: The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" section, there's a paragraph that talks about Sir Simon and a blood-stain at Chase. This seems like it's from a different story or a ghost story, which doesn't relate to Will Bradley's biography. This inconsistency in content is a problem for fluency because it breaks the coherence of the text.

Looking at grammar and syntax, there are some issues. For instance, in the sentence "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling," the structure is a bit awkward. The phrase "as happened" is unclear and might be a fragment. 

There are also instances of inconsistent tense usage. The text jumps between past and present tenses without clear transitions. For example, the introduction is in the present tense when discussing the author's current perspective, but then it shifts to past tense when narrating past events. This can be confusing.

Punctuation problems are present too. Some sentences are run-on or have missing commas. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time..." The comma before "too" might not be necessary, and the transition between sentences could be smoother.

Word choice and phrasing issues include phrases like "turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." The term "exquisite backwater" is a bit vague and might not convey the intended contrast clearly. 

Additionally, there are some awkward phrases such as "the open grave by which they had stood together" which could be rephrased for clarity. Also, the use of phrases like "the poor man had shown him last, the blurred ravaged mask bent over the open grave" is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.

In the section about the boy printer, there's a sentence that starts with "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances." The pronoun "her" is unclearâ€”it might refer to a previous female character, but since the text is about Will Bradley, this is confusing. 

The text also has some abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For example, after discussing the introduction of the book and the impact of Will Bradley, the text suddenly shifts to a detailed narrative about Stransom and the jeweler's shop without any clear connection. This disrupts the flow and makes the text feel disjointed.

There are also some instances of missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, in the line "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings. Attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare." The period after "sings" separates two related ideas, which could be better connected with a semicolon or a comma.

Overall, the text has a mix of fluent sections and parts that are awkward or confusing. The main issues are the disjointed content, inconsistent tense usage, awkward phrasing, and punctuation problems. These issues affect the fluency by making the text harder to follow and less coherent.
