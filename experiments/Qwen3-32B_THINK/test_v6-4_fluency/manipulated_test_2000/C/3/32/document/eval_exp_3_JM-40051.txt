Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of this text based on the given criteria. First, I need to detect any fluency issues that might lead to a point deduction.

Looking at the text, I notice several problems. There are some spelling errors, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions". Also, the word "stuff" is used repeatedly in places where it seems like a proper noun or specific term should be, like "the stuff of the Mississippi River". This repetition is confusing and disrupts the flow.

Next, there are grammatical issues. For example, the sentence "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." has a missing subject and awkward phrasing. The phrase "the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is unclear. Also, the use of commas and periods is inconsistent, leading to run-on sentences or fragmented ones.

Syntax problems are evident in sentences like "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The structure here is awkward and missing a subject. There's also a lack of parallelism in some sentences, making them harder to follow.

The text has some awkward phrasing, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." This is a bit convoluted. Additionally, some sentences are overly long and lack proper punctuation, which affects readability.

There's also an issue with the use of the word "thing" multiple times in places where a specific name or term should be, which creates confusion. For example, "the thing into the Bridtish possessions" and "the a stuff of Eden" don't make sense contextually.

Overall, these issues with spelling, grammar, syntax, and awkward phrasing contribute to a text that's somewhat readable but has several interruptions in fluency. The most serious problems are the repeated use of "stuff" and "thing" where specific terms are missing, along with the grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures. These issues would lower the fluency score but not to the point of making the text incomprehensible. Therefore, the score would likely be around 3 or 3.5, but considering the frequency and impact of the issues, I think a 3 is more appropriate.
