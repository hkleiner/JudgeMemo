Let me analyze the text for fluency issues:

1) First, I'll identify fluency problems:
   - [GRAMMAR] The text has several grammatical errors, such as missing articles (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." The hyphen usage is also inconsistent and confusing.)
   - [SYNTAX] The syntax is often complex and difficult to follow, with long, convoluted sentences that are hard to parse.
   - [SPELLING] There are some spelling errors, though they appear to be minimal.
   - [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often inconsistent and sometimes confusing, with improper use of dashes and other punctuation marks.
   - [LEXICON] The word choice is generally appropriate for the subject matter, though it is quite formal and archaic.
   - [STRUCTURE] There are some structural issues in the latter part of the text where the flow of ideas becomes confusing.
   - [CLARITY] There are several passages that are unclear or difficult to understand due to the complex sentence structures and archaic language.
   - [PARALLELISM] Some sentences have issues with parallel structure, making them harder to follow.

2) The most serious problems that justify point deductions:
   - [SYNTAX] The text contains numerous complex, run-on sentences that are difficult to follow and understand.
   - [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors that affect the clarity of the text.
   - [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often inconsistent and sometimes confusing.
   - [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or difficult to understand due to the complex sentence structures and archaic language.
   - [STRUCTURE] The latter part of the text has structural issues that make it harder to follow the author's arguments.

3) Fluency score: The text is generally readable and coherent, but contains multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways. Based on the scale, I would rate it a 3. The text is readable but has enough issues to make it less than fully fluent.

Let me review the text again to confirm these issues:

Looking at the passage, I see many long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow. For example:
"But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching."

And:
"The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined."

The text also has some grammatical issues, such as:
"Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England; and the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion..."

There are also some punctuation issues, such as the inconsistent use of dashes and the use of a dash instead of a colon or semicolon in some places.

Based on my analysis, I would maintain my score of 3 for fluency.
