Let me analyze the text for fluency issues and then provide a score based on the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll identify the most serious problems in the text that affect fluency:

1) [SYNTAX] The text contains numerous sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts, especially in the final paragraph where the author writes "But possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed."

2) [GRAMMAR] There are many grammatical errors throughout the text, such as "have ventured to publish it" (missing subject), "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the locationâ€”and it not being on that continent" (missing subject and verb), and "the discovery, resulted from my familiarity" (missing article).

3) [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, including "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "jageed" (should be "jagged"), and "Bridtish" (should be "British").

4) [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent and often incorrect punctuation, including missing commas, incorrect use of dashes, and run-on sentences.

5) [PHRASING] The text contains awkward phrasing and word choices that make it difficult to follow, such as "It is located on the 'eastward bank' of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota."

6) [COHESION] The text lacks cohesive transitions between ideas and paragraphs, making it challenging to follow the author's argument and logic.

7) [READABILITY] The overall readability is affected by the inconsistent capitalization of certain words (e.g., "Mississippi" vs. "euphrates"), the use of archaic or unusual terms, and the overall disjointed structure.

8) [SYNTAX] The text contains some run-on sentences that are difficult to parse, such as the sentence about the hanging garden that runs for multiple lines without proper punctuation.

9) [SPELLING] There are multiple instances of misspelled words throughout the text.

10) [PHRASING] The author uses some awkward phrasing that makes the text difficult to understand, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place."

Now, I'll determine the final fluency score based on these issues and the evaluation criteria:

The text has numerous significant issues that affect fluency. It contains many grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. The syntax is often incorrect, with sentence fragments and run-on sentences. The punctuation is inconsistent and often incorrect. These issues significantly impact the readability and flow of the text.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

Given the number and severity of the issues, I would place this text at a 2.5. It has frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structure. While some segments are clear and readable, the overall comprehension is often difficult without effort to parse through the issues. It doesn't quite reach the lowest score of 1 because the text is generally understandable, even with the many problems.

So my final assessment is:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Numerous sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts - [GRAMMAR] Many grammatical errors - [SPELLING] Several spelling errors - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent and often incorrect punctuation - [PHRASING] Awkward phrasing and word choices - [COHESION] Lacks cohesive transitions between ideas - [READABILITY] Overall readability is affected by inconsistent capitalization and disjointed structure - [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences that are difficult to parse - [SPELLING] Multiple instances of misspelled words - [PHRASING] Awkward phrasing that makes the text difficult to understand
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
