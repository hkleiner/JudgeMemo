Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. Let me start by reading through it carefully to spot any issues.

First off, there's a lot of spelling mistakes. Words like "dkscovered" instead of "discovered," "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," and "princopak" instead of "principal" are pretty obvious. These typos make the text harder to read and distract from the content.

Next, the grammar. The sentence structure is sometimes awkward. For example, "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject. Also, there are run-on sentences and fragments that don't flow well. Phrases like "But having become thoroughly satisfied..." start with a conjunction, which isn't ideal.

Looking at syntax, the text has some misplaced modifiers. Like "standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat..." – the subject here is unclear. Also, the use of em dashes and commas is inconsistent, which can confuse the reader.

Punctuation is another issue. There are missing commas in places where they're needed, and some sentences are too long without proper breaks. For instance, "It is located on the “eastward bank” of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota." The Oxford comma is missing after Wisconsin.

Word choice and phrasing are sometimes awkward. Phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" are a bit forced. Also, there's repetition of words like "garden" and "river," which could be varied for better flow.

There are also some logical jumps. The text moves from discussing the Garden of Eden to specific locations in the US without smooth transitions. This makes the argument feel disjointed.

Overall, the text is readable but has several issues that affect fluency. The spelling and grammar errors are the most distracting, followed by awkward phrasing and punctuation problems. These issues don't make the text impossible to understand, but they do require the reader to slow down and parse through the errors. Considering the evaluation scale, this would likely be a 2.5 or 3. The text is generally readable but has enough issues to lower the score from a 4.
