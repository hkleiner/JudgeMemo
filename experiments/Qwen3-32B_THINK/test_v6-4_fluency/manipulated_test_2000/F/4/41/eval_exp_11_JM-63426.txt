Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text to detect fluency issues. The text is an introduction to Will Bradley's chapbook and a chapter about his early life. I need to look for problems in syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "seem" is misspelled as "seem" in "before I had seem the book’s text itself." That should be "seen." Then there's "toom" in "what a closed and stuffy toom Bradley entered," which should be "room." Another one is "werebknown" which is likely "were known." 

Next, there are typos in words like "Yelpow Book" which might be "Yellow Book," and "avant garde galaxy" which could be "avant-garde galaxy." There's also "emriched" instead of "enriched." In the second chapter, "om Baltimore Street im Lynn" has incorrect prepositions; "on" and "in" should be used instead of "om" and "im." 

Looking at syntax and grammar, there are some awkward phrases. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." The phrase "in another way, too" is a bit confusing. Also, "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, ismsitting on the platform" has a typo with "ismsitting" and the sentence structure is a bit off. 

Punctuation issues include missing commas in places like "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." It might need a comma after "Nineties." There's also a missing period in "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." The sentence after "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget." should probably end with a period.

Word choice and phrasing: "There werecderivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride..." The "cderivative" is a typo for "derivative," and the phrasing "whose hasn’t?" is a bit awkward. Also, "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any esquisite backwater." "Esquisite" should be "exquisite."

Overall, the text has a number of spelling and typo errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few punctuation issues. However, the main content is still readable and the flow is mostly maintained despite these problems. The errors are somewhat frequent but not so dense that they make the text hard to understand. I would categorize the fluency as mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt the overall readability. So the score might be a 4.
