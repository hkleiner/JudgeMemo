2) Other fluency issues:

- "IR" at the beginning of the first paragraph should be "It is"
- "as ifmthey, and they only" should be "as if they, and they only"
- "now that after three hundred years of faithful srrvice" should be "now that after three hundred years of faithful service"

- "the real groundworknof that opinion" should be "the real groundwork of that opinion"
- "b ro ascertain" should be "b is to ascertain"
- "1 Vor. x. 16, 17" is an unusual and unclear reference format

3) Overall assessment:
The text has numerous spelling errors and occasional awkward phrasing, but the content is generally clear and the meaning is understandable. The issues are primarily in spelling and some minor typos, rather than in grammar or syntax. The text appears to be a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England.

Based on the evaluation criteria:
- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal to no grammatical issues
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt readability
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues that interrupt flow
- Score 2: Contains frequent errors that make comprehension difficult
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible

This text would likely score a 3.5. It has numerous spelling errors and some awkward phrasing that would interrupt the flow for a reader. While the content is generally clear and the overall meaning is understandable, the frequent errors would make the reading experience less smooth and would require some effort from the reader to decipher.
