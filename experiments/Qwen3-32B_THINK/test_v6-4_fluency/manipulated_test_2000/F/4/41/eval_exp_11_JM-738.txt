Let me carefully analyze the text for fluency issues according to the given criteria.

First, I'll go through the text and identify any problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency Issues:
1) [GRAMMAR] - "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world "have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a demned outline," elaborate construction is not absolutsly "essential.""
   - This sentence has a misplaced comma after "think," making the structure awkward and confusing.
   - "demned" appears to be a typo for "damned"
   - "absolutsly" is a misspelling of "absolutely"
   - The quotation marks and punctuation are inconsistently used

2) [GRAMMAR] - "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises."
   - "ajd" is a misspelling of "and"

3) [GRAMMAR] - "We think if Scottâ€™s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, "smacked of the apoplexy.""
   - The sentence structure is confusing and incomplete
   - "seuzures" is a misspelling of "seizures"

4) [SPELLING] - "apopldxy" is a misspelling of "apoplexy"

5) [SPELLING] - "oeft" is a misspelling of "left"

6) [SPELLING] - "seuzures" is a misspelling of "seizures"

8) [SPELLING] - "x lack" should be "a lack"

9) [SPELLING] - "kpium" is a misspelling of "opium"

10) [SPELLING] - "fromcthe life" should be "from the life"

11) [SPELLING] - "conceaoed" is a misspelling of "concealed"

12) [SPELLING] - "thebsupernormal" should be "the supernatural"

13) [SPELLING] - "there arectwo specimens" should be "there are two specimens"

14) [GRAMMAR] - "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of "The Signalman" in _Mugby Junction_."
   - The sentence structure is awkward and could be clearer

15) [GRAMMAR] - "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests fhat she is the mother of John Jasper" - "fhat" is a misspelling of "that"

16) [SPELLING] - "thickmblack" should be "thick black"

17) [SPELLING] - "ovwr" is a misspelling of "over"

18) [SPELLING] - "nickjamed" is a misspelling of "nicknamed"

25) [SPELLING] - "bloom of a lass," with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head of long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been cut."
   - The punctuation and formatting here is inconsistent and confusing
   - The word "long" is repeated unnecessarily

26) [GRAMMAR] - "Sapsea and Durdles" - "Sapsea" and "Durdles" appear to be misspelled names that should be "Sapsea" and "Durdles" (if these are character names, they might be intentional, but they still look like typos)

27) [GRAMMAR] - "at thrir wine,vexpecting a third guest."
   - "thrir" is a misspelling of "their"
   - "vexpecting" is a misspelling of "expecting"
   - The comma usage is inconsistent

28) [SPELLING] - "Durdpes" is a misspelling of "Durdles"

29) [GRAMMAR] - "The tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the Princess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself."
   - The sentence is long and could be more clearly structured
   - The placement of "beheld by Jasper" is awkward

30) [SPELLING] - "Fathedral" is a misspelling of "Cathedral"

31) [GRAMMAR] - "He pronouhces it "unintelligible," which satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, muzt be unintelligiboe also."

   - "unintelligiboe" is a misspelling of "unintelligible"

34) [SPELLING] - "muzt" is a misspelling of "must"

35) [SPELLING] - "unintelligiboe" is a misspelling of "unintelligible"

   - The punctuation and formatting here is inconsistent and confusing
   - The word "long" is repeated unnecessarily

40) [SPELLING] - "btothal" is a misspelling of "betrothal"

Based on these issues, I need to determine a score on the 1-5 scale.

This text has numerous spelling errors (dozens of misspelled words) and some grammatical issues that affect readability. However, the overall meaning is generally clear, and the content is well-structured. The text appears to be an academic analysis of Dickens's work, and the content is coherent despite the errors.

Given the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented.

This text would fall between 3 and 4 on the scale. It's generally readable and the content is clear, but the numerous spelling and grammatical issues would definitely distract from the reading experience. The text contains dozens of errors, which is more than what would be considered "minor" for a 4 rating.

I would give this text a score of 3.5. The content is clear and the structure is logical, but the numerous spelling and grammatical errors significantly affect fluency.
