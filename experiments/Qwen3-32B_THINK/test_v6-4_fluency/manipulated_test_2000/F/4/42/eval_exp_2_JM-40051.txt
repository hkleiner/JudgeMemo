Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to identify any issues with fluency, which includes grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Starting with the first paragraph: "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then went ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The phrase "then went ahead" seems out of place because it should be "then go ahead" if it's part of the principle. That's a grammar issue. Also, "had venture to published it" – "venture" is missing a "d" to make it "ventured" and "published" should be "publish" since it's after "to." So that's a grammar and spelling problem.

Next, "In gave the antldiluvians a description..." There's a typo here with "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians." Also, "In gave" is incorrect; it should be "He gave" or "He has given." So that's a spelling and grammar issue.

Looking further: "how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts..." The structure here is a bit awkward. The transition from "how..." to "he simply stated..." is abrupt. That's a syntax issue.

Then there's "it not being on that continent, he could not pointed it out to them..." Missing "to" in "could not pointed" – should be "could not point." Also, "pointed" is incorrect; it should be "point out." So that's a grammar issue.

In the next part: "the finger of time has am plainly pointing..." "has am" is incorrect. It should be "has been" or "has am" is a typo. Also, "am plainly pointing" – "am" doesn't fit here; maybe "has plainly pointed." So that's a grammar and syntax problem.

There's also a lot of inconsistent verb tenses. For example, "I made the discovery of the garden, and commence developing the facts..." "Commence" should be "commenced" to match the past tense. That's a grammar issue.

Spelling errors like "admirirg" instead of "admirable" or "admiring." Also, "mighted was its proper dimentions" – "mighted" should be "might have been" and "dimentions" is misspelled as "dimensions." That's a spelling and grammar issue.

Another example: "But of this last fact I is ignorant..." "I is" should be "I am." That's a grammar mistake.

In the section about the rivers: "the Euphrates river crossed that country, that 'eastward', or on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is locate the garden of Eden..." The structure here is confusing. The placement of "is locate" is incorrect. It should be "is located." Also, the sentence is a run-on and could be split for clarity. That's a syntax and grammar issue.

There are also instances of missing prepositions. For example, "We need not now undertook to prove..." should be "undertake." So that's a grammar problem.

Punctuation issues: Commas and periods are sometimes missing or misplaced. For example, "But by degrees it has am opening to the minds of some..." The "am" here is likely a typo for "been," and the sentence structure is awkward. Also, missing commas in complex sentences can affect readability.

Word choice: Phrases like "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" use awkward phrasing. "Am" doesn't fit here, and "pointing" might be better as "pointed."

Repetition and redundancy: The text repeats phrases like "Our garden is in that place" and "Our garden is again right," which can be considered redundant, affecting fluency.

Overall, the text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues. These problems interrupt the flow and make the text harder to follow. While some sentences are clear, the cumulative effect of these issues lowers the fluency score. The errors are frequent enough to impact readability but not so severe that the text is entirely incomprehensible. Therefore, the score would likely be around a 3, but considering the number and severity of issues, maybe a 2.5 or 3.
