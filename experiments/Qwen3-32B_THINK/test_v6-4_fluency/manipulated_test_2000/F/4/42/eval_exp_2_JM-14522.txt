Okay, I need to evaluate the fluency of this text. Let me start by reading through it carefully. 

First, I notice several grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "every one tell him" should be "every one told him." The verb tense is incorrect here. Then, "when they come to discuss terms" uses "come" instead of "came." That's a past tense issue. 

Looking further, there's "the ghost has am see by several living members..." which seems like a mix-up. It should probably be "the ghost has been seen." The use of "am see" is incorrect. 

Another example is "we'dded have it at home" – the correct past tense of "wed" is "wed," so "wedded" is redundant. Then there's "the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended" – "went" should be "going to be suspended." 

In the section about Washington Otis, "by led the German at the Newport Casino" should be "by leading the German." The past participle is missing. 

There's also a mix of verb tenses. For instance, "the purchase was concluded, and at the close of the season the Minister and his family go down..." "Go" should be "went." 

Some sentences have incorrect subject-verb agreement. "The twins am usually called" should be "The twins are usually called." Similarly, "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses" should be "are." 

Punctuation issues are present too. Missing commas in complex sentences, like "the ghost has am see by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of the parish..." could be confusing. 

There are also awkward phrasings, such as "I had always been of opinion that emigration was the only thing for England." The structure is a bit off, maybe "I had always been of the opinion..." 

Looking at the second chapter, "The whole family were now quite interested" – "were" should be "was" if "family" is considered a collective noun, but in American English, "family" is often plural. However, the context might require singular. 

Another error is "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts..." which should be "The conversation did not turn upon ghosts..." 

I also notice some incorrect use of past perfect tenses. For example, "the library have been lock up" should be "had been locked up." 

Overall, the text has multiple grammatical errors, subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. These issues affect fluency by making the text harder to read and understand. However, the story is still generally comprehensible, so the score might be around 3 or 3.5. Let me check the scale again. 

According to the scale, a score of 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity." Given the number of errors, I think a 3.5 is appropriate. The text is readable but has enough issues to disrupt fluency.
