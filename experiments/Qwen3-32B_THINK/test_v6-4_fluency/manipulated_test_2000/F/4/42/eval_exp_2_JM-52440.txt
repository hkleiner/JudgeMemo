Okay, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency of this text, which is a chapter from a book on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, I need to identify any fluency issues. Fluency issues can include grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me go through the text line by line.

Looking at the first paragraph, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, "is teach by the Church of England" should be "is taught by." The verb tense is incorrect here. Another example is "and they only, am the true expositors" – the verb "am" doesn't agree with the subject "they." That's a subject-verb agreement issue. 

Moving on, there's "blindly give" which should be "blindly given." The past participle is missing. Then, "to had been settle" – the correct form should be "had been settled." The use of "had been" followed by "settle" is incorrect. 

In the next paragraph, "am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England" – the verb "am" is correct here, but the structure is a bit awkward. Also, "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what was the real point at issue" – the phrase "In did this" is incorrect. It should probably be "In doing this" or "In doing so." 

There's a sentence that says "But, I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranged the three principal points at issue under the three heads of the Real Presence..." The verb "arranged" should be "arranging" here. Also, "was the real point at issue" – the past tense "was" might not be appropriate here. 

Looking at the next chapter, "THIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our first and chief attention must was directed." The phrase "must was directed" is incorrect. It should be "must be directed." 

In the section discussing the Bible, "we was taught by our Lord Himself" – the verb "was" should be "were." Also, "we was taught" should be "we were taught." 

There are several instances where the past tense is used incorrectly. For example, "we was taught by our Lord Himself" – "was" should be "were." Similarly, "we being many, are one bread and one body" – the structure here is a bit awkward and could be clearer. 

In the discussion of the Church of England's doctrine, "they maintained that the bread and wine did not cease to have the accidents of bread and wine, so that they might still be speak of as bread and wine" – "speak" should be "spoken." 

There's also an issue with the use of "have am introduced" – the correct form would be "have been introduced." 

Looking at the part about the Articles and Catechism, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—beared more or less upon the subject" – "beared" is incorrect; it should be "bear." Also, "referred to sacraments in general. ‘Sacraments ordain of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men’s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace..." The verb "ordain" is used incorrectly here. It should probably be "ordained" or "ordained by Christ."

Another example is "by the which He doth worked invisibly in us" – "doth worked" should be "doth work." 

In the section on baptism, "are grafted into the Church; (2) the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to was the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly sign and seal" – "to was the sons" is incorrect. It should be "to be the sons." Also, "sign and seal" should be "signed and sealed." 

There are several instances where the past tense is incorrectly used instead of the present or present participle. For example, "the sign woulded cease to be a sign if it am changed into the thing signify" – "woulded" should be "would cease," and "am changed" should be "is changed." 

The text also has some awkward phrasing that makes reading a bit difficult. For example, "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not referred, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." The structure here is a bit confusing and could be rephrased for clarity. 

Overall, the text has numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and awkward phrasing. These issues do affect the fluency of the text, making it harder to read and understand. However, the content itself is coherent and the main points are clear, so the fluency issues are not so severe that they make the text entirely unintelligible. 

Considering the evaluation criteria, the text would likely fall into the 3 category because it has multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow and clarity. However, if the majority of the text is still readable and the issues are not too frequent, it might be a 3.5. But given the number of errors and the fact that they are spread throughout the text, I think a 3 is more appropriate. However, the user allows half-points, so maybe 2.5 if the errors are more severe. But looking back, while there are many errors, the text is still generally understandable. So perhaps a 3 is the right score. Wait, but the scale says for a 3: "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways." The text here does have multiple issues that are noticeable. So 3 is correct. Alternatively, if the errors are more severe and frequent, maybe 2.5. But given the examples, I think 3 is the right score.
