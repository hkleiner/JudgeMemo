Alright, I'm being asked to assess the quality of a written story in terms of fluency and coherence, using specific aspects for each. I'll need to go through the text carefully to identify any issues in these areas and then rate the text on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).

First, let me understand what fluency and coherence mean in this context:

**Fluency** refers to how smoothly the text is written and how easy it is to read. It includes aspects like:
- Syntax and grammar
- Spelling and punctuation
- Word choice
- Phrasing
- Flow

**Coherence** refers to how well the text makes sense as a whole and how well the ideas connect to each other. It includes aspects like:
- Logical sequencing
- Non-repetitiveness
- Smooth connections
- Ambiguity avoidance
- Structural consistency

Now let me read through the text and identify issues in each of these categories.

### Fluency Issues:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I had a reasonable thing of it, had venture to published it." - This has multiple grammatical issues (missing subject, incorrect verb form).
   - "It should was sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed" - Subject-verb agreement issue.
   - "But of this last fact I is ignorant" - Subject-verb agreement issue.
   - "mighted was its proper dimentions" - Incorrect verb form and spelling.
   - "shoulded be a place" - Incorrect verb form.
   - "It shoulded be a place" - Same issue.
   - "I had relate the facts" - Incorrect verb form.
   - "we had a clue" - Subject-verb agreement issue.
   - "we have found it where he and others, can came and see for themselves" - Verb form issue.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - "antldiluvians" - Misspelling.
   - "dimentions" - Misspelling.
