Alright, let's assess the quality of the text regarding fluency and coherence. I'll go through each of the aspects for both metrics to identify issues and then determine the final scores.

### Fluency Evaluation:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as "absolutsly" instead of "absolutely", "ajd" instead of "and", "romam" instead of "roman", and "notvout" instead of "not out".
   - Some sentences have awkward structure, like "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises" (missing "with" between "plots" and "rich").

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - There are multiple spelling errors: "apopldxy" instead of "apoplexy", "se" instead of "he", "notvout" instead of "not out", "conceaoed" instead of "concealed".
   - Missing punctuation in some places, like in "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises" (should be "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises").
   - Some commas and periods seem misplaced or missing.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the academic and literary context, but there are some jarring terms like "romam policier" (should be "roman policier") and "kpium den" (should be "opium den").
   - Some word choices appear awkward or inappropriate for the context, like "not unpleasant contrast" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.

4. **Phrasing**:
   - There are several awkward phrasings, such as "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, 'smacked of the apoplexy.'" This sentence is confusing in structure and meaning.
   - Some phrases are unnecessarily wordy, like "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _romam policier_, careful study of character."

5. **Flow**:
   - The flow is generally good for an academic analysis, but there are some abrupt transitions between ideas.
   - Some paragraphs are very long and dense, making the flow feel a bit choppy.
   - The transition from the introduction to the "Story" chapter is somewhat abrupt.

### Coherence Evaluation:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - The overall structure is logical for an academic analysis, but some sections jump between ideas without clear transitions.
   - The introduction discusses Dickens's writing style and then abruptly transitions to a specific character analysis in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without clear linkage.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - There is some repetition of ideas, particularly around Dickens's focus on construction and plot in his later works.
   - Some points about Jasper's character and his relationship with Rosa are repeated in slightly different contexts.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - The connections between paragraphs are generally smooth, but there are some abrupt transitions between topics.
   - Some sentences end with one idea and the next sentence begins with an unrelated idea, creating a disjointed feel.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - There are several ambiguous phrases or sentences that could be clearer. For example, "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, 'smacked of the apoplexy.'" This sentence is confusing and lacks clarity.
   - Some references to characters and plot points are unclear without more context.

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - The structure is mostly consistent as an academic analysis with an introduction, character list, and narrative analysis.
   - However, the formatting is inconsistent with some italics and formatting errors (like "romam policier" instead of "roman policier").
   - The text seems to jump between different aspects of the story without clear organization.

### Final Scores:

Based on the analysis above, I'll rate the text:

**Fluency Score**: 2/5
- The text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt reading.
- Some word choices and phrasings are awkward or inappropriate.
- While the text is generally readable, the errors and awkward phrasing significantly impact fluency.

**Coherence Score**: 3/5
- The overall structure is logical for an academic analysis, but there are issues with smooth transitions between ideas.
- Some sections feel disjointed or abrupt.
- There is some repetition and ambiguity that affects coherence.
- The text attempts to maintain a consistent structure but has some inconsistencies in organization.

The text appears to be a scholarly analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" but suffers from significant editing and proofreading issues that affect both fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Issues:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:  
   - Multiple grammatical errors, such as "absolutsly" instead of "absolutely," "ajd" instead of "and," and missing prepositions (e.g., "rich in secrets ajd surprises").  
   - Awkward sentence structures, e.g., "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises."  

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:  
   - Frequent spelling errors: "apopldxy" → "apoplexy," "se" → "he," "conceaoed" → "concealed."  
   - Missing or misplaced punctuation, e.g., in the sentence about Scott’s earlier seizures.  

3. **Word Choice**:  
   - Jarring terms like "romam policier" (should be "roman policier") and "kpium den" (should be "opium den").  
   - Awkward phrasing, e.g., "not unpleasant contrast."  

4. **Phrasing**:  
   - Confusing or overly wordy sentences, e.g., "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins... combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _romam policier_, careful study of character."  
   - Unclear sentence structure: "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind..."  

5. **Flow**:  
   - Abrupt transitions between ideas, e.g., from Dickens’s writing style to specific character analysis.  
   - Long, dense paragraphs that disrupt readability.

### Coherence Issues:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:  
   - Sudden jumps between topics, e.g., from general discussion of Dickens to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without clear linkage.  
   - Some sections lack a clear narrative thread.  

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:  
   - Repetition of ideas about Dickens’s focus on construction and plot.  
   - Redundant descriptions of Jasper’s character and relationships.  

3. **Smooth Connections**:  
   - Disjointed transitions between paragraphs and ideas.  
   - Sentences often end with one idea and start with another, creating fragmentation.  

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:  
   - Ambiguous or unclear sentences, e.g., "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind..."  
   - Unclear references to characters and plot points without sufficient context.  

5. **Structural Consistency**:  
   - Inconsistent formatting (e.g., italics and formatting errors).  
   - Jumps between different aspects of the story without clear organization.
