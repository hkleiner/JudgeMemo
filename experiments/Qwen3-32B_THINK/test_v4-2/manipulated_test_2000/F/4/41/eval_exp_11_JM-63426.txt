Okay, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence based on the given aspects. First, I need to go through the text carefully and check each aspect for both metrics.

Starting with fluency. The first aspect is syntax and grammar. I'll read through the text and see if there are any grammatical errors. For example, in the first chapter, there's a line: "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The phrase "stir in its sleep" is a bit odd, but maybe it's a stylistic choice. I don't see any obvious grammatical errors like subject-verb agreement issues. 

Next, spelling and punctuation. There are some typos. For instance, "toom Bradley" should be "room Bradley," and "wasbknown" is missing an apostrophe, so it should be "wasn't known." There's also "there werecderivative" which looks like "were derivative" with an extra 'c' and 'd'. These spelling errors disrupt the flow a bit. Punctuation seems okay overall, but some sentences are run-on and could use commas or periods to break them up.

Word choice: The vocabulary is appropriate for a historical narrative, but some phrases are a bit archaic or awkward. For example, "romped like a breeze through American graphic arts" uses "romped" which is a bit unusual. The word choice is generally good, but some sentences could be more concise.

Phrasing: There are some awkward phrasings. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career..." The phrasing here is a bit clunky. The sentence structure is complex, which might make it harder to follow.

Flow: The flow between sentences and paragraphs is generally smooth, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from talking about Bradley's impact to the historical context of the Nineteenth Century in Europe is a bit sudden. The flow could be improved with better transitions.

Now moving to coherence. Logical sequencing: The story starts with an introduction about Bradley, then moves to his early life. The sequence is logical, but some parts jump around in time or context without clear transitions. For example, the transition from the introduction to the boy printer chapter is abrupt.

Non-repetitiveness: The text does not seem to repeat information much, but there are some instances where the same points are mentioned in different sections. For example, Bradley's impact on American graphic arts is mentioned in both the introduction and the later chapters, which might be a bit redundant.

Smooth connections: Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, after discussing Bradley's early work, the story jumps to his time in Ishpeming without a clear connection. Using transition words or phrases would help here.

Ambiguity avoidance: There are a few ambiguous parts. For example, "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" is vague. It's not clear what the advice was, but maybe that's intentional for the narrative style. However, some phrases could be more explicit.

Structural consistency: The story has two main chapters, which is consistent. However, the narrative jumps between different time periods and contexts without clear markers. The structure is mostly consistent but could benefit from more organization to avoid confusion.

Putting it all together for fluency, the main issues are spelling errors and some awkward phrasing. For coherence, the main issues are abrupt transitions and lack of smooth connections. Considering these points, I'll rate each aspect and then determine the final scores.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Coherence Issues**:  
- **Logical Sequencing**: The narrative shifts abruptly between historical context and personal anecdotes without clear transitions (e.g., from European art movements to Bradley’s early life).  
- **Smooth Connections**: Paragraphs often lack transitional phrases, making jumps between ideas (e.g., from Bradley’s career to his retirement) feel disjointed.  
- **Structural Consistency**: The story oscillates between two distinct chapters with minimal thematic linkage, and the chronological flow is occasionally disrupted by tangential details.  

**Fluency Issues**:  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Errors like *toom* (room), *wasbknown* (wasn’t known), *there werecderivative* (were derivative) disrupt readability.  
- **Phrasing**: Awkward constructions (e.g., *“a version of them‘old army game’”* with incorrect apostrophe/spacing) and overly complex sentences (e.g., *“He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off…”*) hinder smooth reading.  
- **Flow**: Some sentences are run-on (e.g., *“The print shop is above a saloon and in one corner of a big barn of a room…”*), and abrupt shifts in tense/setting (e.g., *“You are now a working man—wages three dollars a week.”*) create jarring transitions.
