Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of this story. The user mentioned several aspects: syntax and grammar, spelling and punctuation, word choice, phrasing, and flow. 

First, looking at syntax and grammar. The text has some run-on sentences and awkward structures. For example, "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject, which makes it a fragment. There are also some passive constructions that could be more direct. However, overall the grammar isn't too bad, just a few errors.

Next, spelling and punctuation. There are several misspelled words: "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians," "princopak" is "principal," "locayion" is "location," "thr" is "the," "thr" again later, "acclimate" might be "acclimated," "dimentions" is "dimensions," "investigatikn" is "investigation," "ingenuoty" is "ingenuity," "euphony" is correct, "Havilah" is likely correct, "Bridtish" is "British," "thjs vast aeea" is "this vast area," "innabited" is "inhabited," "ignotance" is "ignorance," "eere" is "were," "splendid" is correct, "grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality" is okay, "their language was confounded and their work delayed" is a reference to the Tower of Babel, so maybe correct, "scwttered" is "scattered," "commencing more than half way up the mound" is "commencing" is correct, "jt is dotted" is "it is dotted," "O, how beautifully" is a comma splice. Punctuation issues include missing commas, periods, and some run-on sentences. There are also some missing quotation marks and inconsistent use of italics or other formatting. The spelling errors are noticeable but not excessive.

Word choice: The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the context, but some phrases are awkward or outdated. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr ‘North West’" uses "thr" instead of "the," and "North West" with lowercase letters. The use of "thr" and other abbreviations might be a style choice, but it's inconsistent. There are some archaic terms like "antideluvians" and "Havilah" which might be correct in context but could be confusing to modern readers. The word "euphony" is correctly used but might not be common.

Phrasing: The text has some awkward phrasing. For example, "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent" is a bit clunky. The sentence structure is often complex and could be simplified for clarity. Some phrases are overly verbose, like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr ‘North West’ as the place." The use of phrases like "as a matter of pleasantry" is okay but could be more natural.

Flow: The flow is somewhat disrupted by the run-on sentences and the lack of clear transitions. The text jumps from one idea to another without smooth connections. For example, the author moves from discussing the Garden of Eden to the location in Wisconsin without a clear transition. The flow is also affected by the spelling and punctuation errors, which can make the reading experience choppy.

Now, moving on to coherence. The aspects here are logical sequencing, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections, ambiguity avoidance, and structural consistency.

Logical sequencing: The text starts with the author's discovery and the principle of verifying before publishing. It then discusses the Bible's description of Eden, the search for its location, and the author's identification of it in Wisconsin. The logical flow is mostly there, but some sections are disjointed. For example, the transition from the Garden of Eden to the specific location in Wisconsin is abrupt. The author also jumps between different aspects of the location without clear progression.

Non-repetitiveness: The text does have some repetition. For example, the author mentions the Garden of Eden multiple times, sometimes in the same paragraph. The phrase "our garden" is used repeatedly, which can be redundant. There's also repetition in the description of the location's features, such as the rivers and the valley.

Smooth connections: The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt. The author uses phrases like "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some..." without clear linking to the previous sentence. The lack of transition words and the sudden shifts in topic make the connections between ideas less smooth.

Ambiguity avoidance: There are parts where the text is ambiguous. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr ‘North West’ as the place" is unclear in its meaning. The phrase "the finger of time" is metaphorical but not well explained. Some terms like "antideluvians" and "Havilah" are not clearly defined, which could confuse readers. The author also makes claims without sufficient evidence, leading to ambiguity about the reasoning.

Structural consistency: The structure of the text is somewhat consistent in that it follows the author's narrative of discovery and explanation. However, the structure is disrupted by the frequent digressions and the lack of clear sections. The text includes multiple descriptions of the location and its features without a clear progression, making it hard to follow the main argument.

Putting it all together, the fluency score is affected by the spelling and punctuation errors, awkward phrasing, and disrupted flow. The coherence is impacted by the repetition, lack of smooth transitions, and some ambiguity. However, the text does maintain a central theme and logical progression despite these issues. I would rate fluency a 3 and coherence a 3 as well, considering the errors and issues but acknowledging the overall attempt to present a coherent argument.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

### Coherence Issues:  
1. **Logical Sequencing**: Jumps between ideas (e.g., from biblical references to geographical claims) without clear transitions.  
2. **Non-repetitiveness**: Overuse of phrases like "our garden" and repeated descriptions of the same features.  
3. **Smooth Connections**: Abrupt shifts between paragraphs (e.g., from "rattlesnakes" to "La Crosse’s church spires").  
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Unclear terms (e.g., "finger of time") and underexplained metaphors (e.g., "shadow and lost the reality").  
5. **Structural Consistency**: Digressions and inconsistent focus between theological claims and geographical details.  

### Fluency Issues:  
1. **Syntax and Grammar**: Run-on sentences, missing subjects (e.g., "have ventured to publish it"), and awkward phrasing (e.g., "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some").  
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Frequent errors (e.g., "locayion," "thjs vast aeea," "investigatikn") and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing commas, run-ons).  
3. **Word Choice**: Overly archaic or unclear terms (e.g., "antldiluvians," "Havilah") and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "North West").  
4. **Phrasing**: Verbose and convoluted sentences (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr ‘North West’ as the place").  
5. **Flow**: Disrupted by spelling errors, abrupt topic shifts, and lack of transitional phrases.
