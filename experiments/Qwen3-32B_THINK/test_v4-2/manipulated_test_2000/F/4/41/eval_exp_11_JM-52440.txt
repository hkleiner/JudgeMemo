Alright, I'll assess the quality of the given text in terms of fluency and coherence, using the specified aspects for each metric.

### Fluency Evaluation:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**: I need to check if the sentences are well-constructed grammatically.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: I'll look for spelling errors and punctuation issues.
3. **Word Choice**: I'll evaluate if the vocabulary is appropriate for the context.
4. **Phrasing**: I'll assess if the phrases are well-structured or awkward.
5. **Flow**: I'll check if the text flows smoothly from one sentence to the next.

### Coherence Evaluation:

1. **Logical Sequencing**: I'll check if the ideas are presented in a logical order.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**: I'll look for unnecessary repetition.
3. **Smooth Connections**: I'll assess if the transitions between sections or ideas are smooth.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: I'll check if the text avoids ambiguity.
5. **Structural Consistency**: I'll evaluate if the narrative or argument is structured in a consistent and clear manner.

Let me analyze the text:

### Fluency Issues:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - "best-establisjed" (should be "best-established")
   - "unvommon" (should be "uncommon")

   - "wnd" (should be "and")
   - "Daviour" (should be "Saviour")

   - "ln earth" (should be "on earth")
   - "hexven" (should be "heaven")
   - "tye" (should be "the")
   - "dign" (should be "sign")
   - "perfectiony" (should be "perfectly")
   - "generak" (should be "general")
   - "chamge" (should be "change")
   - "noment" (should be "moment")

2. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - The overall syntax is generally correct for a formal theological text.
   - The structure is complex but appropriate for the subject matter.
   - There are a few awkward constructions, but they don't significantly impact comprehension.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - The vocabulary is appropriate for a theological and religious text.
   - The author uses specific theological terminology correctly.
   - The word choice contributes to the formal and scholarly tone.

4. **Phrasing**:
   - Some phrases are a bit long and complex, but this is appropriate for the subject matter.
   - There are a few awkward phrases, but they don't significantly disrupt the reading experience.

5. **Flow**:
   - The text flows reasonably well through the arguments.
   - There are some transitions that could be smoother.
   - The flow is generally good for a formal theological discussion.

### Coherence Issues:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - The text has a logical sequence as it introduces the topic, presents arguments, and provides supporting evidence.
   - The structure moves from introduction to specific topics in a coherent manner.
   - The logical sequence is generally clear and well-organized.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - There is some repetition of ideas, particularly around the concept of the Real Presence.
   - The author sometimes rephrases the same points in slightly different ways.
   - While repetition is somewhat expected in theological discussions, it could be reduced for better clarity.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - The transitions between sections and ideas are generally smooth.
   - The author uses appropriate transitional phrases to connect ideas.
   - There are a few places where the connection between ideas could be clearer.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - The text is generally clear and avoids ambiguity.
   - The author presents complex theological concepts in a way that is usually clear.
   - There are a few instances where the meaning could be slightly ambiguous, particularly with the use of terms like "accidents" in a theological context.

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - The text has a consistent structure with an introduction, main body, and clear organization of ideas.
   - The arguments are presented in a consistent manner throughout the text.
   - The structure supports the author's purpose and makes the content easy to follow.

### Final Ratings:

Based on the analysis:

**Fluency Score**:
- The text has significant spelling and punctuation errors that disrupt the flow.
- The overall syntax and grammar are generally good for a formal text.
- The word choice is appropriate for the subject matter.
- The phrasing is mostly clear and well-structured.
- The flow is generally good, though there are some areas for improvement.

Considering these factors, I would rate the fluency as a 2. The text has many errors that make it difficult to read and understand, despite having a generally good structure and appropriate vocabulary.

**Coherence Score**:
- The logical sequencing is generally good, with a clear organization of ideas.
- There is some repetition, but it's somewhat expected in theological discussions.
- The transitions between sections and ideas are mostly smooth.
- The text avoids significant ambiguity in presenting its arguments.
- The structure is consistent and supports the author's purpose.

Considering these factors, I would rate the coherence as a 3. The text is generally coherent with a clear organization of ideas, but it has some issues with repetition and could benefit from clearer transitions.

Wait, let me revise my fluency and coherence scores after more careful consideration:

**Fluency Score**:
The text has numerous spelling and punctuation errors that significantly disrupt the reading experience. These errors make the text harder to follow and understand. The complex syntax is appropriate for the subject matter, but the frequent errors reduce the overall fluency.

I believe the fluency score should be a 2.

**Coherence Score**:
The text has a logical structure and presents its arguments in a generally coherent manner. The organization of ideas is clear, and the transitions between sections are mostly smooth. However, the text could benefit from clearer connections between some ideas and could reduce some repetition.

I believe the coherence score should be a 3.
