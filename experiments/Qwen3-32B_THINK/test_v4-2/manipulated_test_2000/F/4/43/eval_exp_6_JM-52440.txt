Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the specified aspects. Let me start with fluency.

First, syntax and grammar: The sentences are generally well-structured, but there are some complex sentences that might be confusing. For example, "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This part is a jumble and hard to parse. So, there's a problem with syntax here.

Spelling and punctuation: I notice a few instances where punctuation is missing or incorrect. For example, in the same jumbled sentence, there are missing commas and periods, making it run-on. Also, in "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift. It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign," the sentence structure is off, and "It be" should be "It is."

Word choice: The vocabulary is appropriate for the context, as it's a theological discussion. However, some phrases are repetitive or awkward, like "the the of two perfectly the eating faith," which doesn't make sense and seems like a typo or error.

Phrasing: There are several awkward phrasings. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject;" uses em dashes in a way that's a bit jarring. Also, the sentence structure in some parts is convoluted, making it hard to follow the argument.

Flow: The flow is somewhat disrupted by the jumbled sentences and the lack of clear transitions between paragraphs. For example, after discussing the Articles, the text jumps into a detailed analysis without smooth transitions, which could confuse the reader.

Now, moving to coherence.

Logical sequencing: The text starts with an introduction, then moves to the Real Presence, and then discusses the Articles. This seems logical, but within the sections, some ideas are presented without clear connections. For example, the discussion of the Articles jumps from one point to another without smooth transitions.

Non-repetitiveness: There's some repetition in the arguments, especially regarding the nature of sacraments and the Church's teachings. However, it's part of the theological discussion, so maybe intentional. But there are instances where the same points are made without adding new insights, which could be seen as repetitive.

Smooth connections: The transitions between sections are somewhat abrupt. For example, after discussing the Real Presence, the text moves to the Articles without a clear transition sentence. Also, within the analysis of the Articles, the flow between paragraphs isn't always smooth.

Ambiguity avoidance: There are parts where the text is ambiguous or unclear. The jumbled sentence about "the the of two perfectly the eating faith" is a clear example. Also, some theological terms are used without clear definitions, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.

Structural consistency: The structure is generally consistent with an introduction, main chapters, and a conclusion. However, the internal structure of the chapters has some inconsistencies, such as the abrupt shifts in topic and the jumbled sentences disrupting the flow.

Putting it all together, the fluency has some significant issues with syntax, spelling, and phrasing, which lower the score. Coherence is also affected by logical sequencing and ambiguous parts, but the overall structure is somewhat coherent despite the problems.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

### Coherence Issues:  
- **Logical Sequencing**: The argument jumps between theological concepts without clear transitions, especially in the analysis of the Articles.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Key sections (e.g., "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith...") are incoherent and lack clarity.  
- **Smooth Connections**: Abrupt shifts between paragraphs (e.g., from the Real Presence to the Articles) disrupt the narrative flow.  
- **Structural Consistency**: The text occasionally devolves into disjointed phrasing, undermining its formal structure.  

### Fluency Issues:  
- **Syntax and Grammar**: Numerous run-on sentences and grammatical errors (e.g., "It be a water the point changed...").  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Missing punctuation, incorrect em dash usage, and fragmented sentences.  
- **Phrasing**: Awkward constructions (e.g., "the the of two perfectly the eating faith") hinder readability.  
- **Flow**: Jumbled sentences and abrupt topic shifts disrupt the natural progression of ideas.
