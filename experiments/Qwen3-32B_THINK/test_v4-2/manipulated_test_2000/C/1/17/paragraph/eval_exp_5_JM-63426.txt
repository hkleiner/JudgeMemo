I need to evaluate the given story in terms of fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues for each metric and then providing final scores from 1 to 5.

Let's start with the fluency evaluation:

**Fluency Evaluation Aspects:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar**: 
   - Generally good syntax and grammar throughout most of the text
   - Some minor issues with sentence structure in the second chapter (e.g., "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.")
   - A few places where the sentence structure is slightly awkward but not severely problematic

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: 
   - No obvious spelling errors
   - Punctuation appears generally correct
   - Some inconsistent quotation mark usage in the second chapter (e.g., dialogue is sometimes enclosed in single quotes and sometimes in double quotes)
   - Some dialogue lacks proper punctuation (e.g., missing periods at the end of quoted statements)

3. **Word Choice**: 
   - Vocabulary is appropriate for the context and contributes to a smooth reading experience
   - Some archaic or unusual word choices that fit the historical context but might be less familiar to modern readers
   - Overall, the word choice is effective and contributes to the narrative

4. **Phrasing**: 
   - Phrasing is generally well-structured and clear
   - Some long, complex sentences that could be more concise
   - A few awkward phrasings that make comprehension slightly more difficult (e.g., "The two jobbers are kicked")

5. **Flow**: 
   - The text flows generally well from one sentence to the next
   - Some abrupt transitions between paragraphs
   - The second chapter has a strange insertion that seems out of place: "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed."
   - This section appears to be a narrative fragment that doesn't connect well with the rest of the text

Now for the coherence evaluation:

**Coherence Evaluation Aspects:**

1. **Logical Sequencing**: 
   - The overall narrative has a logical progression in the first chapter
   - The second chapter has a clear chronological narrative of Will Bradley's early life
   - However, the story about "Sir Simon" in the second chapter is problematic as it doesn't seem to connect to the main narrative
   - The text shifts abruptly from the story of Will Bradley to this unrelated Sir Simon story

2. **Non-repetitiveness**: 
   - The text is largely free from unnecessary repetition
   - There is some repetition of ideas about Bradley's impact on American graphic arts
   - However, this repetition is generally for emphasis and not redundant

3. **Smooth Connections**: 
   - The first chapter has smooth transitions between ideas
   - The second chapter has good flow for the most part
   - The transition to the Sir Simon story is abrupt and creates a jarring effect
   - The transition back to Will Bradley's story is also abrupt without explanation

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: 
   - Most of the text is clear and avoids ambiguity
   - The Sir Simon story introduces ambiguity as it doesn't connect to the main narrative
   - Some references are unclear (e.g., who "she" is in relation to Sir Simon)
   - The overall narrative of Will Bradley is generally clear and unambiguous

5. **Structural Consistency**: 
   - The first chapter has a consistent structure as an introduction to Bradley's work
   - The second chapter has a consistent structure as a narrative of Bradley's early life
   - The inclusion of the Sir Simon story disrupts the structural consistency
   - The text appears to be a mix of different genres (introduction, biography, and what seems like a Gothic short story fragment)

Based on these evaluations:

**Fluency Issues:**
- Minor issues with sentence structure in some places
- Inconsistent quotation mark usage
- Some awkward phrasings
- A few places where punctuation could be improved
- One section with a strange narrative fragment that disrupts flow

**Coherence Issues:**
- The most significant issue is the inclusion of the Sir Simon story which seems out of place and unrelated to the main narrative about Will Bradley
- This creates a major disruption in logical sequencing and structural consistency
- The transition to and from this story is abrupt
- The text appears to be a mix of different genres that aren't well integrated

Now let me assign final scores:

For fluency, I would rate this text as a 4. It has generally good fluency with only minor issues in a few places. The writing is mostly clear and easy to follow.

For coherence, I would rate this text as a 3. While the main narrative about Will Bradley is coherent, the inclusion of the Sir Simon story creates significant coherence problems that disrupt the overall flow and understanding of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
