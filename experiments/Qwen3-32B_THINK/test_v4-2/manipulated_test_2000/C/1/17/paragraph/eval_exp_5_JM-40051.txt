Okay, let me start by reading through the user's query and the provided story to understand what they need. The user wants to evaluate the story's quality in terms of fluency and coherence, using specific aspects for each. They also want the final scores based on these evaluations.

First, I need to assess the fluency. The aspects here are syntax and grammar, spelling and punctuation, word choice, phrasing, and flow. Let me go through the story and check each point.

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure seems okay, but there are some odd phrases like "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." The capitalization of "CHAPTER" seems misplaced. Also, "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject. That's a syntax issue. 

Spelling and punctuation: I notice "admirirg" instead of "admir*ing*". That's a spelling error. Also, "dimentions" should be "dimensions". There are some missing commas and hyphens where needed. For example, "the “North West,” as the place." The comma after "North West" is correct, but other places might be missing punctuation.

Word choice: The story uses some archaic or overly formal language, which might be intentional but could affect readability. For instance, "antldiluvians" is probably a typo for "antediluvians". Also, phrases like "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some" are a bit awkward.

Phrasing: Some sentences are run-on or lack clarity. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The use of "evidently" here is a bit jarring. There's also inconsistency in the use of "it" without clear antecedents.

Flow: The text jumps between different topics without smooth transitions. For example, after discussing the garden, there's a sudden mention of Jasper and Rosa, which seems out of context. This disrupts the flow and makes the story feel disjointed.

Now, moving to coherence. The aspects here are logical sequencing, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections, ambiguity avoidance, and structural consistency.

Logical sequencing: The story starts with the discovery of Eden, then discusses the location, but then shifts to a completely different narrative about Jasper and Rosa, which doesn't connect to the previous content. This lack of logical flow makes the overall structure confusing.

Non-repetitiveness: The text does repeat some ideas, like the description of the garden's features, but the main issue is the unrelated section about Jasper and Rosa, which seems to be a fragment from a different story, leading to confusion.

Smooth connections: The transitions between the Eden narrative and the Jasper/Rosa part are abrupt. There's no indication of a shift in topics, making it unclear how these sections relate. The story also jumps back to the Eden description without explanation.

Ambiguity avoidance: The text is ambiguous in several places. For instance, the mention of "our garden" without prior introduction creates confusion. Also, the sudden appearance of characters from a different story adds to the ambiguity.

Structural consistency: The story lacks a consistent structure. It starts as a narrative about Eden but then shifts to a completely different plot involving characters from a different story, which is jarring and makes the overall structure inconsistent.

Considering all these points, I need to rate each aspect for fluency and coherence. For fluency, the syntax and grammar have some issues, spelling and punctuation have errors, word choice is sometimes awkward, phrasing is inconsistent, and the flow is disrupted by disjointed sections. For coherence, the logical sequencing is poor, there's lack of smooth connections, ambiguity is present, and the structure is inconsistent. The non-repetitiveness is somewhat maintained in the main sections, but the unrelated Jasper part introduces unnecessary repetition in a different context.

Final scores would be low due to the multiple issues affecting both fluency and coherence. The presence of unrelated sections and structural inconsistencies would likely result in a lower score, but I need to balance the aspects to give a fair rating.

**Fluency Evaluation Issues:**  
- **Syntax and Grammar**: Several run-on sentences and missing subjects (e.g., "have ventured to publish it").  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Errors like "admirirg" (should be "admir*ing*"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), and inconsistent punctuation.  
- **Word Choice**: Overly archaic or awkward phrasing (e.g., "antldiluvians" likely a typo for "antediluvians").  
- **Phrasing**: Awkward constructions (e.g., "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some").  
- **Flow**: Disjointed transitions between unrelated sections (e.g., Eden narrative abruptly shifts to Jasper/Rosa story).  

**Coherence Evaluation Issues:**  
- **Logical Sequencing**: Incoherent jumps between topics (e.g., from Eden to a fictional romance subplot).  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: Unrelated sections (Jasper/Rosa) disrupt focus.  
- **Smooth Connections**: No transitions between Eden narrative and the abrupt insertion of a different story.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Unclear references (e.g., "our garden" introduced without context).  
- **Structural Consistency**: Inconsistent structure—starts as a historical/religious narrative but shifts to a fictional plot with no clear connection.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**
