Okay, let's start by reading through this story to understand what it's about. The author is claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, specifically between La Crosse and Winona. They use biblical references and geographical descriptions to support their argument. 

First, I need to assess fluency. The aspects are syntax and grammar, spelling/punctuation, word choice, phrasing, and flow. Let me check each one.

Syntax and Grammar: The sentences are mostly well-constructed, but there are some awkward structures. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." The capitalization of "CHAPTER" here is odd and might be a typo. Also, some sentences are run-on or have misplaced commas. 

Spelling and Punctuation: I notice a few errors. "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians." There's a typo in "admirirg its most wonderful scenery." Also, "dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions." Punctuation issues include missing commas and inconsistent use of dashes and semicolons. For example, "the Euphrates river crosses that country, that “eastward”, or on the eastward, bank..." has some unnecessary commas and repetition.

Word Choice: The vocabulary is generally appropriate, but there are some awkward phrases. For example, "the fabled dog, ‘they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality’" is a bit unclear. The use of terms like "ampitheater" instead of "amphitheater" is a misspelling. Also, "jageed" is a typo for "jagged." Some phrases are overly verbose, which might affect readability.

Phrasing: Some sentences are awkwardly worded. For example, "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent..." The phrasing here is a bit convoluted. There are also instances where the author uses complex sentences that could be simplified for better flow.

Flow: The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the geographical features, the author suddenly mentions the city of La Crosse and its lumber mills. The flow is disrupted by these shifts in topic. Also, the structure is a bit meandering, with the author going back and forth between describing the location and making biblical connections.

Now, coherence. The aspects are logical sequencing, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections, ambiguity avoidance, and structural consistency.

Logical Sequencing: The argument is somewhat logical but the sequence of ideas is not always clear. The author starts with the premise of the Garden of Eden, then describes the location, but sometimes digresses into tangential points about the city of La Crosse or the historical context of settlers. This can confuse the reader about the main argument.

Non-repetitiveness: The text does repeat some ideas, such as the location between La Crosse and Winona and the comparison to the Euphrates and Mississippi. While repetition can be used for emphasis, here it feels redundant and doesn't add new insights. For example, the author mentions the "eastward bank" multiple times without varying the phrasing.

Smooth Connections: Transitions between sections are abrupt. The author moves from describing the geographical features to the history of settlers, then to the presence of snakes, and back to the scenery. These shifts lack clear connectors, making the flow disjointed. For example, after discussing the hanging garden, the author suddenly talks about rattlesnakes, which seems like a non-sequitur.

Ambiguity Avoidance: There are instances of ambiguity. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing..." is a metaphor that's a bit unclear. Also, the author's use of biblical references without clear explanations might leave some readers confused about the connections being made. The sentence structure in some parts is complex, leading to confusion about the intended meaning.

Structural Consistency: The overall structure is inconsistent. The author starts with an introduction, then moves through various descriptions and arguments, but the organization is not clear. There's a lack of a clear thesis statement or outline, which makes the narrative feel meandering. The conclusion is abrupt, ending with the author's hope for further investigation, but the rest of the text doesn't build up to that in a structured way.

Putting it all together, the fluency has several issues with spelling, punctuation, and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow. Coherence is also affected by the lack of logical sequencing, repetitive points, and abrupt transitions. The author's argument is present but not clearly structured, making it hard to follow. Both fluency and coherence scores would be moderate, but I need to check if there are any other aspects I missed.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

### Coherence Issues:  
- **Logical Sequencing**: The argument jumps between geographical descriptions, biblical references, and tangential historical anecdotes (e.g., settlers’ greed, rattlesnakes) without clear transitions.  
- **Non-repetitiveness**: Redundant emphasis on "eastward bank" and "Garden of Eden" comparisons lacks new insights, weakening the narrative.  
- **Smooth Connections**: Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from the "hanging garden" to La Crosse’s lumber mills) disrupt flow and coherence.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Unclear metaphors (e.g., "the finger of time") and unexplained biblical allusions (e.g., "antdeluvians") confuse readers.  
- **Structural Consistency**: The text lacks a clear thesis or organizational framework, meandering between claims and descriptions without resolving its central argument.  

### Fluency Issues:  
- **Syntax and Grammar**: Awkward phrasing (e.g., "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some") and inconsistent sentence structure (e.g., run-ons, misplaced commas).  
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: Typos ("antldiluvians," "jageed") and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., unnecessary commas, missing dashes).  
- **Word Choice**: Overly verbose or archaic phrasing ("fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills") and misused terms ("ampitheater" instead of "amphitheater").  
- **Phrasing**: Clumsy constructions (e.g., "the fabled dog, ‘they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality’") hinder readability.  
- **Flow**: Disjointed transitions between paragraphs and abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from geological features to rattlesnakes) disrupt smooth progression.
