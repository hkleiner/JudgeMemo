Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency aspects. The text is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. First, I need to check for syntax and grammar. The sentences are generally well-constructed, though there are some complex structures. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" has em dashes and numbers that might be a bit confusing. But overall, the syntax is mostly correct.

Next, spelling and punctuation. I notice some typos like "ans place reliance" instead of "and place reliance" and "vlindly" instead of "blindly". There are also some punctuation issues, such as missing commas and incorrect use of em dashes. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing..." uses em dashes in a way that might be non-standard. These errors are noticeable but don't severely disrupt the flow.

Word choice seems appropriate for the context. The vocabulary is formal and theological, which is suitable for the subject matter. However, some words like "doctrune" and "docteine" are misspelled, which affects the reading experience. The phrasing is mostly clear, though some sentences are very long and could be broken up for better readability. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." This sentence is a bit unwieldy but still understandable.

Flow between sentences is generally good, but there are some abrupt transitions. The text moves from one theological point to another without always providing smooth transitions. For example, after discussing the Articles, it jumps to the Catechism without a clear connecting sentence. This could make the flow feel a bit disjointed at times.

Now, moving to coherence. Logical sequencing is mostly maintained, as the text follows a structured argument from introduction to the three main points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each chapter builds on the previous one, which helps maintain logical flow. However, some sections could be more clearly organized. For example, the discussion of the Articles and Catechism is thorough but could benefit from clearer subheadings or paragraph breaks to guide the reader.

Non-repetitiveness is generally good. The author doesn't repeat the same points excessively, though there are some areas where similar arguments are made in slightly different ways. For example, the repeated emphasis on the distinction between sign and thing signified in different sections could be streamlined for better clarity.

Smooth connections between sections are sometimes lacking. The text uses phrases like "But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there is a special Article on the subject," which provide some transition, but other transitions are abrupt. For instance, moving from the discussion of the Articles to the Catechism is done without a clear signpost, which might confuse the reader.

Ambiguity avoidance is mostly effective. The author is clear in distinguishing between the Church of England's teachings and those of Rome. However, some terms like "Sacrament" are used in different contexts (outward sign vs. inward grace), which could be confusing if not carefully noted. The author does address this, but it might still be a point of ambiguity for some readers.

Structural consistency is strong. The text follows a clear structure with an introduction, three main chapters, and a conclusion. Each chapter is devoted to a specific aspect of the doctrine, which helps maintain consistency. However, the formatting of the text, with some odd em dashes and inconsistent punctuation, might slightly affect the perceived structure.

Overall, the text is well-written for a theological treatise, with some minor issues in fluency and coherence that don't severely detract from its quality. The main issues are spelling errors, complex sentence structures, and occasional abrupt transitions. Coherence is maintained through logical sequencing and structural consistency, though some sections could benefit from clearer transitions.

**Fluency Evaluation Aspects:**  
- **Syntax and Grammar:** Generally well-constructed, though some complex sentences and em-dash usage (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing...") create minor confusion.  
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** Noticeable errors (e.g., "ans," "vlindly," "doctrune," "docteine") disrupt flow; inconsistent punctuation (e.g., em-dashes, missing commas).  
- **Word Choice:** Appropriate for the formal theological context, though some archaic or overly complex phrasing (e.g., "venerable," "sifting time") may hinder clarity.  
- **Phrasing:** Mostly clear, but long, dense sentences (e.g., multi-clause explanations of sacramental theology) could benefit from breaks.  
- **Flow:** Generally smooth, but abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., from "Articles" to "Catechism") and repetitive emphasis on key terms (e.g., "sign" vs. "thing signified") occasionally disrupt continuity.  

**Coherence Evaluation Aspects:**  
- **Logical Sequencing:** Strong overall structure (introduction → Real Presence → Adoration → Sacrifice), with each chapter building on prior arguments.  
- **Non-repetitiveness:** Some repetition of core distinctions (e.g., sign vs. grace) across sections, but this reinforces the central thesis rather than detracting from it.  
- **Smooth Connections:** Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt (e.g., "But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions..."), reducing readability.  
- **Ambiguity Avoidance:** Clear distinctions between Church of England and Roman Catholic doctrines, though the term "Sacrament" is used in multiple senses (outward sign, inward grace), risking confusion without explicit clarification.  
- **Structural Consistency:** Consistent organization with clear headings, but formatting inconsistencies (e.g., em-dashes, irregular paragraph breaks) slightly undermine perceived coherence.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
