Let me evaluate the story for fluency and coherence based on the aspects provided.

### Fluency Evaluation:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - The text contains numerous grammatical errors. For example: "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing" (should be "thing" is likely a placeholder for a publication name).
   - There are incorrect verb forms, missing articles, and other grammatical issues.
   - The text often lacks subject-verb agreement and has run-on sentences.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - There are many spelling errors: "admirirg" instead of "admir-ing", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "beatiful" instead of "beautiful".
   - Punctuation is often missing or incorrect, with run-on sentences and missing commas where they're needed.
   - There are many instances of "a stuff" and "a thing" which appear to be placeholders that were never properly filled in.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the context, but the frequent use of "a stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders is jarring and unprofessional.
   - The text contains some archaic or overly formal language that doesn't match the overall style.

4. **Phrasing**:
   - The phrasing is often awkward and repetitive.
   - The text frequently uses awkward constructions and word choices that make the reading experience less smooth.
   - There are many instances of repetition and circular phrasing.

5. **Flow**:
   - The flow is disrupted by the numerous errors and the frequent repetition of content.
   - The text jumps around in its narrative structure, often returning to the same points multiple times.
   - The frequent use of "a stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders breaks the flow and makes the text feel incomplete.

### Coherence Evaluation:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - The logical sequencing is often disrupted by the repetition of content and the jumping between topics.
   - The text attempts to present a coherent argument but frequently loses focus and returns to previous points.
   - The narrative structure is not well-organized, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - The text is extremely repetitive. Many ideas and descriptions are repeated multiple times.
   - The author often restates the same points in slightly different words, creating redundancy.
   - The text appears to be a patchwork of ideas that are not well-connected or presented in a logical sequence.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - The transitions between sections are often abrupt.
   - The text frequently jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions.
   - The use of "a stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders makes it difficult to follow the connections between ideas.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - The text is filled with ambiguity, especially from the frequent use of "a stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders.
   - Many statements are vague or unclear, especially when referring to specific locations or people.
   - The author often makes claims without providing sufficient context or explanation.

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - The structural consistency is poor. The text appears to be a collection of disconnected passages rather than a cohesive narrative.
   - The author frequently revisits the same points from different angles.
   - The text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, making it difficult to follow the author's intended message.

### Final Scores:

Based on the above analysis, I would rate:

**Fluency Score**:
- The text has significant issues with grammar, spelling, and word choice.
- The phrasing is often awkward and the flow is disrupted by repetition and errors.
- I would rate the fluency as a 2/5.

**Coherence Score**:
- The text lacks logical sequencing and is extremely repetitive.
- The connections between ideas are often unclear or abrupt.
- The text has many ambiguities and lacks structural consistency.
- I would rate the coherence as a 2/5.
