Okay, I need to evaluate the story text provided in terms of fluency and coherence, using the given aspects. Let me start by understanding each aspect and how to assess them.

For **Fluency**:
1. **Syntax and Grammar**: I'll check if sentences are well-constructed and grammatically correct.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Look for spelling errors and correct punctuation usage.
3. **Word Choice**: Ensure the vocabulary is appropriate and enhances the reading experience.
4. **Phrasing**: Determine if phrases are structured well or if they're awkward.
5. **Flow**: Assess if the text flows smoothly from one sentence to the next.

For **Coherence**:
1. **Logical Sequencing**: Check if ideas are presented in a logical order.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**: Identify if there's unnecessary repetition.
3. **Smooth Connections**: Look at transitions between sections or ideas.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Ensure the text is clear and not ambiguous.
5. **Structural Consistency**: Evaluate if the narrative or argument is consistent and clear.

First, I'll read through the text to get a general sense. The story is about Will Bradley's life and career in graphic arts. It's written in a biographical style with a narrative flow. The text is quite long and detailed, with many historical references and technical terms related to printing and design.

**Fluency Evaluation**:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**: The sentences are generally well-structured. There are complex sentences, but they are grammatically correct. I notice a few instances where the syntax might be a bit convoluted, but not to a point of confusion. For example, in the sentence "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern..." the structure is a bit complex, but still grammatically sound.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: I don't see any obvious spelling errors. Punctuation seems appropriate, though there are some instances of missing commas or periods that could be improved for clarity. For example, in the sentence "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." the dash usage is correct but might be a bit abrupt.

3. **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is appropriate for the context of a biography of a graphic designer. Technical terms related to printing and design are used correctly. However, there are some archaic or less common words that might be confusing to some readers, like "pi" (which seems to refer to type characters) without explanation.

4. **Phrasing**: The phrasing is generally clear, but there are a few awkward phrases. For example, "You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and return with a supply of unfinished." The repetition of "carry" and the phrasing could be smoother.

5. **Flow**: The text flows reasonably well, but there are some abrupt transitions between ideas. For example, the shift from describing Will's childhood to his later career is sometimes jarring. Also, the use of "stuff" as a placeholder for missing information disrupts the flow.

**Coherence Evaluation**:

1. **Logical Sequencing**: The narrative generally follows a chronological sequence, which is logical for a biography. However, there are some sections where the sequence is disrupted by tangents or the use of "stuff" as a placeholder, which makes it harder to follow.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**: There are some instances of repetition, such as repeated mentions of Caslon typefaces and Bradley's contributions to printing. While some repetition is expected in a biography, it could be more varied or contextualized differently to avoid redundancy.

3. **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections and ideas are sometimes abrupt, especially when moving from one period in Will's life to another. The use of phrases like "And now we are in a thing, the mid Gay Nineties..." doesn't provide a smooth transition.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: There are several instances of ambiguity due to the use of "stuff" as a placeholder for missing information. This makes the text unclear in those sections. Additionally, some technical terms related to printing and design are used without explanation, which could be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the field.

5. **Structural Consistency**: The structure is consistent in that it follows a biographical narrative, but the use of "stuff" and the lack of clear transitions between sections disrupts the overall consistency. The text also includes a "Chronology" section at the end, which helps with structural clarity but is not integrated into the main narrative.

**Final Scores**:

For **Fluency**, the text is generally well-written with good syntax and grammar, but there are some minor issues with phrasing and flow. I would rate it a 4.

For **Coherence**, the narrative is logical and consistent, but the use of "stuff" and abrupt transitions reduce the overall coherence. I would rate it a 3.
