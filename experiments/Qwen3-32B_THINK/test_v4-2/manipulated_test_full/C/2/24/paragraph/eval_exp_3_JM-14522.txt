Alright, let me assess the quality of this text in terms of fluency and coherence. First, I'll go through each of the specified aspects for both metrics and note any issues.

**Fluency Evaluation Aspects:**

1. **Syntax and Grammar:** The sentences are well-constructed. I don't notice any grammatical errors. The text is written in a formal, narrative style typical of literature.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation:** The spelling appears correct. Punctuation is used appropriately throughout the text.
3. **Word Choice:** The vocabulary is appropriate for the context. The author uses descriptive and period-appropriate language effectively.
4. **Phrasing:** The phrasing is generally well-structured. Some sentences are quite long and complex, but they serve the narrative purpose.
5. **Flow:** The text flows smoothly from one sentence to the next. The narrative progresses logically and maintains a consistent tone.

**Coherence Evaluation Aspects:**

1. **Logical Sequencing:** The story is presented in a logical sequence. The narrative follows a clear timeline and progression of events.
2. **Non-repetitiveness:** The text avoids unnecessary repetition. Each paragraph introduces new information or developments.
3. **Smooth Connections:** The transitions between sections and ideas are smooth. The narrative flows naturally from one scene to the next.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance:** The text is generally clear and avoids ambiguity. The narrative is straightforward and the intentions of the characters are clear.
5. **Structural Consistency:** The narrative structure is consistent and clear. The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a consistent point of view.

Now, I'll rate the text based on these observations:

**Coherence Score:** 5
The text is highly coherent. The narrative is logically structured, with smooth transitions between ideas and scenes. It avoids unnecessary repetition and ambiguity, and maintains a consistent structure throughout.

**Fluency Score:** 5
The text is fluent with well-constructed sentences, correct spelling and punctuation, appropriate vocabulary, and smooth flow from one sentence to the next.

Wait, I notice some strange phrases in the text that don't quite fit the narrative style. Phrases like "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions," "A voice command triggered automation," "A wireless charger powered up," and "The biosensor updated its readout" seem out of place in an 1890s ghost story. These modern technological references disrupt the narrative flow and coherence of the text. I need to revise my assessment to account for these issues.

Let me reassess:

**Fluency Evaluation:**
- The majority of the text is well-written with proper grammar and syntax.
- However, the sudden inclusion of modern technology references breaks the narrative flow and feels jarring to the reader.
- These anachronisms disrupt the fluency of the text.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
- The story is generally coherent and well-structured.
- However, the anachronistic elements introduce confusion and disrupt the logical sequence of the narrative.
- The modern references seem to be inserted randomly without explanation or relevance to the story.

I'll revise my scores to reflect these issues:

**Fluency Score:** 4
The text is generally fluent with proper grammar and syntax, but the inclusion of anachronistic technological references disrupts the flow and creates a jarring effect.

**Coherence Score:** 4
The story is mostly coherent with a logical structure, but the random insertion of modern technology references creates confusion and disrupts the narrative's internal logic.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

**Coherence Issues:**  
- The narrative is generally well-structured and logically sequenced, but the random insertion of modern technological references (e.g., "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions," "A wireless charger powered up") disrupts the internal logic and historical setting.  
- These anachronisms create confusion and break immersion, as they lack contextual relevance to the 1890s ghost story premise.  
- Some transitions between scenes feel abrupt due to the jarring shifts in tone and setting caused by the modern elements.  

**Fluency Issues:**  
- Syntax and grammar are mostly correct, with well-constructed sentences and appropriate vocabulary.  
- Spelling and punctuation are largely accurate, though the narrative flow is occasionally disrupted by the anachronistic phrases.  
- Phrasing is generally effective, but the sudden modern references (e.g., "A voice command triggered automation") clash with the formal, period-appropriate language, creating an uneven reading experience.  
- The flow is generally smooth, but the jarring anachronisms occasionally break the rhythm and coherence of the text.
