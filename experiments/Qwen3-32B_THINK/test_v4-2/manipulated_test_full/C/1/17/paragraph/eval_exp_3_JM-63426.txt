I'll analyze the text for fluency and coherence based on the fine-grained aspects provided.

### Fluency Evaluation:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:
   - The text generally has well-constructed sentences.
   - There are some complex sentences that could be clearer, but overall the syntax is mostly correct.
   - I don't notice any major grammatical errors that significantly disrupt reading.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:
   - The text appears to have minimal spelling errors.
   - Punctuation is generally appropriate, though there are a few places where punctuation could be more consistent (e.g., missing commas in complex sentences).
   - There are a few instances of inconsistent or missing quotation marks.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - The vocabulary is appropriate for the context of a biographical narrative about a designer.
   - The author uses some archaic or old-fashioned expressions that are appropriate for the historical context.
   - The word choice contributes to the narrative flow and doesn't hinder readability.

4. **Phrasing**:
   - The phrasing is generally well-structured.
   - There are some awkward or overly complex phrases that could be simplified for better readability.
   - The author occasionally uses run-on sentences that could benefit from being broken up.

5. **Flow**:
   - The text flows reasonably well through the narrative of Will Bradley's life and career.
   - There are some transitions between paragraphs and sections that could be smoother.
   - The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics with varying degrees of smoothness.

### Coherence Evaluation:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:
   - The text is a biography of Will Bradley, so the logical sequencing follows his life chronologically for the most part.
   - However, there are some disjointed sections that jump between different periods or topics without clear transitions.
   - Some chapters or sections could benefit from clearer connections to the overall narrative.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:
   - There are some instances of repetition, particularly in the way the author describes his work and achievements.
   - Some information about Bradley's career is repeated in different sections.
   - The text could be more concise in some places to avoid redundancy.

3. **Smooth Connections**:
   - The connections between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth, but there are some abrupt transitions.
   - Some chapters begin without clear connections to the previous content.
   - The narrative could benefit from more transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:
   - The text is generally clear and avoids ambiguity in most cases.
   - There are a few instances where the meaning could be clearer, particularly in complex sentences.
   - Some historical references might be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the context.

5. **Structural Consistency**:
   - The text has a consistent structure in the form of a biography with chapters.
   - However, the structure becomes less consistent in some sections, particularly near the end with the afterword and chronology.
   - The narrative style shifts between first-person and third-person in different sections, which can be confusing.

Based on this analysis:

**Fluency Score**:
- The text is generally well-written with good syntax and grammar.
- There are some complex sentences and occasional awkward phrasing, but these don't significantly impede reading.
- The word choice is appropriate and contributes to the narrative.
- The flow is generally good, though there are some transitions that could be smoother.
- I would rate the fluency as a 4 out of 5.

**Coherence Score**:
- The text has a logical structure as a biography, but there are some disjointed sections.
- There are instances of repetition that could be reduced.
- The connections between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth, though there are some abrupt transitions.
- The text is mostly clear and avoids ambiguity, though some complex sentences could be clearer.
- The structural consistency is somewhat inconsistent, particularly in the narrative style and in the later sections.
- I would rate the coherence as a 3.5 out of 5, which I'll round up to 4.

So, my final assessment is:
- FINAL Coherence Score: 4
- FINAL Fluency Score: 4
