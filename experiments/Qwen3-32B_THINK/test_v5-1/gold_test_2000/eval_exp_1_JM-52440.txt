Alright, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate it based on Coherence and Fluency using a 1-5 scale. 

First, I need to understand what each criterion means. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole. Are the ideas logically connected? Is there a clear progression? No abrupt jumps or ambiguities. Fluency is about the sentence-level aspects: grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Are the sentences smooth and easy to read?

Looking at the story, it's a religious text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. The structure is clear with chapters and sections. The introduction sets up the purpose, and each chapter follows a logical sequence. The arguments are presented methodically, referencing various articles and scriptures. The flow from introduction to the real presence, then to adoration and sacrifice, seems logical. There's a clear progression in each section, and the ideas build on each other. I don't see any abrupt shifts or confusing parts. So for Coherence, it's well-structured and logical.

Now for Fluency. The sentences are long and complex, which is typical for theological texts. However, they are grammatically correct. There's a consistent use of formal language, and the vocabulary is precise. The phrasing is a bit archaic but still clear. I notice some repetition of phrases like "the Church of England" and "the real presence," but that's part of the argumentative style. Punctuation is used correctly, with commas and periods appropriately placed. There are no obvious spelling errors. The syntax is a bit dense, but it doesn't hinder readability. So Fluency is good, though the complexity might affect some readers.

Are there any issues? The text is quite dense and might be challenging for a general audience, but that's more about accessibility than fluency. Since the evaluation is based on the criteria given, and not on general readability for all audiences, the fluency score should be high. Coherence is also strong because the structure and logical flow are maintained throughout. 

So, Coherence: 5. Fluency: 5. The text is both coherent and fluent, meeting the criteria for the highest scores.

Feedback: The story is highly coherent with a clear structure, logical progression, and consistent narrative. Ideas are well-connected, and the argument is systematically developed. Fluency is excellent with precise grammar, appropriate word choice, and smooth phrasing, despite the dense and formal style.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
