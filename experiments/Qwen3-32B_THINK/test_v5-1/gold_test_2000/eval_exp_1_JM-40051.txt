Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate this story based on coherence and fluency. First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, using biblical references and geographical features.

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and smooth phrasing. The story is written in an old-fashioned style, which might be intentional. There are some typos like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admiring". Also, "dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions". There are a few awkward phrases, like "By degrees it has been opening to the minds of some" which could be smoother. Punctuation is sometimes inconsistent, like missing commas or incorrect hyphenation. However, overall, the language flows reasonably well despite these issues.

Now for coherence. The story's main idea is the location of the Garden of Eden. The author presents a logical sequence: introduction, explanation of biblical context, discovery, description of the location, and supporting arguments. However, there are some jumps in logic. For example, the connection between the biblical Euphrates and the Mississippi isn't clearly explained. Also, the author brings in elements like the rattlesnakes as a metaphor for the serpent, which is a bit forced. The structure is mostly clear, with each section building on the previous one, but some parts are repetitive, like the repeated emphasis on the Mississippi as the Euphrates. The conclusion ties back to the main argument, so the narrative has a clear progression. However, the use of some analogies and the sudden shift to describing La Crosse might confuse readers.

Putting it all together. Fluency has some errors but is generally readable. Coherence is there but with some logical leaps and repetitive points. So, for fluency, maybe a 3 (some errors but mostly understandable). Coherence could be a 3 as well because the structure is there but not perfectly logical.

Analysis: The story is written in a formal, archaic style with occasional grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions") and awkward phrasing ("By degrees it has been opening to the minds of some"). Punctuation and syntax are inconsistent, but the text remains largely readable. For coherence, the narrative presents a logical sequence of ideas (biblical context, discovery, geographical claims) but includes abrupt shifts and repetitive assertions. The connection between the Mississippi River and the Euphrates is loosely argued, and some analogies (e.g., rattlesnakes as the serpent) feel forced. While the structure is clear, the argument relies on speculative leaps and lacks rigorous evidence.
