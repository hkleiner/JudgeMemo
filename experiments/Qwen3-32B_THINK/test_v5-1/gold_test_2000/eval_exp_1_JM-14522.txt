Okay, let's start by understanding the task. The user provided a story and wants me to evaluate it based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. I need to give feedback for each metric and then assign the scores.

First, I'll look at Fluency. Fluency is about how smooth the text is in terms of grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. The story is written in a formal, old-fashioned style, typical of a gothic tale. Let me scan through for any obvious mistakes. The sentences are complex but well-structured. There's a lot of dialogue, which is properly punctuated with commas and quotation marks. I don't see any spelling errors. The word choice is appropriate for the narrative style, though some phrases might be a bit archaic. For example, "sanguineous stains" is a more formal term, but it fits the context. There's a mix of dialogue and description, which flows smoothly. I don't notice any run-on sentences or fragments. So Fluency seems strong. Maybe a 5?

Now for Coherence. Coherence is about the overall structure and logical progression of the story. The story is a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost," which is a known short story by Oscar Wilde. The plot follows the Otis family moving into a haunted house and their interactions with the ghost. The narrative is logically sequenced: introduction of characters, setup of the haunted house, the first encounter with the ghost, and the initial conflict. Each chapter builds on the previous one. The transition from Chapter I to II is smooth, continuing the story of the blood stain reappearing and the ghost's first appearance. There are no abrupt jumps or inconsistencies. The characters' actions and reactions are consistent with their personalities as established. The setting is described in a way that supports the eerie atmosphere. However, the story is only the first two chapters, so maybe the full coherence can't be assessed, but within the given text, it's well-structured. I don't see any plot holes or confusing elements. So Coherence would also be a 5.

Wait, let me double-check. The story is a direct excerpt from a published work, so it's likely well-written. But maybe there's a minor point. For Fluency, the use of semicolons and colons in complex sentences might be a bit dense, but they're used correctly. The dialogue tags are clear. For Coherence, the transition between the family's arrival and the ghost's introduction is smooth. The cause-effect is clear, like the blood stain reappearing leading to the ghost's appearance. The characters' responses are logical. So I think both scores are 5. The feedback should mention the smooth flow and logical structure without any issues.

Feedback: The story exhibits high fluency with well-structured sentences, proper grammar, and smooth phrasing. The narrative flows naturally without syntax or spelling errors. Coherence is strong, as the plot progresses logically with clear cause-effect relationships, consistent character actions, and smooth transitions between scenes. The narrative maintains a unified structure and avoids ambiguities.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
