Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of coherence and fluency. 

First, coherence. The story is a long, detailed account of someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. The narrative seems to follow a logical structure, moving through different locations and explaining why they fit the biblical description. However, there are some issues. The flow isn't always smooth. The author jumps between different points, sometimes going into lengthy descriptions of geographical features without clear transitions. Also, the argument is a bit repetitive, with the author constantly reiterating that this place fits the criteria. There are some abrupt shifts in focus, like from describing the landscape to discussing geological theories or historical events. The ending parts get a bit tangential, discussing dairying and butter premiums, which don't directly relate to the main thesis. So while there's a clear central idea, the structure could be tighter.

Now, fluency. The text has a lot of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, "the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery" has a typo ("admirirg" instead of "admiring"). There are also run-on sentences and unclear word choices, like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'". The punctuation is sometimes off, with missing commas or incorrect use. The word choice can be inconsistent, such as using "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians". The author also uses archaic or overly complex language that might confuse readers, like "the finger of time" or "the finger of time has been plainly pointing". These issues make the text harder to read and understand.

Putting it all together, for coherence, I'd say it's a 3. It has a central idea but the structure and transitions are weak. For fluency, there are enough errors and awkward phrasings that it affects readability, so maybe a 2.

Feedback: The story presents a coherent argument for locating the Garden of Eden in a specific geographical area, with a logical progression of ideas and clear connections between the narrative and biblical descriptions. However, the text occasionally lacks smooth transitions between sections, and some paragraphs feel repetitive or tangential (e.g., discussions of dairying and geological theories). For fluency, the text contains numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "admirirg," "antldiluvians," "euphonious"), awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation, which disrupt readability. Word choice and sentence structure often feel overly archaic or convoluted (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing"). These issues significantly hinder the text's fluency.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
