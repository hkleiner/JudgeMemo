Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the provided story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency. The story is a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. 

First, for Coherence: I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, non-repetitive, and smoothly connected. The story is structured into chapters, each addressing a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). The author builds an argument step by step, referencing Articles, Catechism, and Homilies. However, there are some parts where the flow is disrupted. For example, the story suddenly shifts to discussing "The Doctrine of the Real Presence" and then to a section about "The Princess Puffer" and other unrelated topics like Millet's artwork and a dog named EXCALIBUR. These insertions seem out of place and break the logical progression. Despite the main argument being well-structured, these digressions reduce the overall coherence.

Next, Fluency: I need to assess syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is formal and dense, with complex sentences. There are some instances of awkward phrasing or run-on sentences. For example, "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." is a long sentence that could be split for clarity. Additionally, there are some grammatical issues, like missing commas or incorrect capitalization in some headings. However, the majority of the text is well-written with proper grammar and vocabulary. The use of theological terms is appropriate, but the overall density might affect readability for some readers.

Considering the evaluation criteria, the Coherence score is affected by the irrelevant sections and the abrupt shifts in topic. The Fluency is mostly good but has some areas where clarity could be improved. I'll rate Coherence as a 3 because the main argument is coherent but marred by digressions. Fluency is a 4 because the text is generally well-written but has some minor issues.

Feedback: The story is generally coherent in its main argument about the Church of England's doctrine, with logical progression through chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. However, several unrelated digressions (e.g., "The Princess Puffer," Millet's artwork, EXCALIBUR the dog) disrupt the flow and coherence. The text is grammatically sound overall, with complex but mostly correct syntax and vocabulary. Some sentences are overly long or awkwardly phrased, slightly affecting fluency.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
