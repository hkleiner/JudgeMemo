Okay, I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The task is to rate the story on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 for each metric. 

First, Fluency: This is about how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to check for any awkward phrasing, errors, or issues that make the text hard to read.

Looking at the story, there are a lot of long, complex sentences. Some run on without proper punctuation. There are instances of misspellings like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions". There are also some grammatical errors, such as missing commas and incorrect verb forms. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" â€“ the use of "CHAPTER" in all caps is confusing and not properly integrated. The text also has some run-on sentences and awkward phrasing that might make it hard to follow. However, the majority of the text is readable, but with some noticeable issues. So for Fluency, maybe a 2 or 3.

Next, Coherence: This assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. It should have logically sequenced ideas, non-repetitive content, smooth transitions, clear progression, and avoid ambiguities or abrupt jumps. 

The story is about the author's claim to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location. The structure is somewhat disjointed. The author jumps between explaining biblical references, describing the geography, and making various claims. There are long descriptions of the landscape and some tangents that don't directly support the main argument. The flow is not very smooth; ideas are presented in a somewhat random order. There are also some abrupt transitions and repetitive points. For example, the author keeps reiterating the location and its features without a clear narrative progression. The story also includes some unrelated snippets at the end, like the part about the motor car and the commercial traveler, which don't connect to the main topic. This makes the overall coherence lower. So for Coherence, maybe a 2.

Putting it all together, the Fluency score is affected by spelling and grammatical errors, while Coherence is impacted by the disjointed structure and lack of smooth transitions. The feedback should mention these points concisely.

Feedback: The text exhibits significant fluency issues with multiple spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions"), grammatical mistakes (e.g., missing commas, incorrect verb forms), and awkward phrasing. Coherence is compromised by disjointed structure, abrupt transitions, repetitive claims, and unrelated tangents (e.g., snippets about a motor car or Jasper). Ideas lack logical sequencing and clear progression, with frequent digressions undermining the central argument.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
