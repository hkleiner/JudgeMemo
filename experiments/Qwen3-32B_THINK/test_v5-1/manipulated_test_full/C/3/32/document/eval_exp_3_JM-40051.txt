Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let's start with Coherence. The story is about someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. The structure is a bit all over the place. The author jumps around describing different geographical features, referencing the Bible, and comparing it to the Garden of Eden. There's a lot of repetition, like mentioning the same locations multiple times. The flow isn't smooth; it's more like a series of disconnected observations rather than a cohesive narrative. The argument for why this place is Eden is presented, but the transitions between ideas are abrupt. There are also some unclear references and placeholders like "a thing" which make it hard to follow. So, for Coherence, I'd say it's somewhat coherent but has many issues with logical flow and repetition.

Now for Fluency. There are several grammatical errors, like "the stuff river" and "a thing," which are placeholders and not actual words. There's also incorrect spelling, such as "euphony" instead of "euphony," and "beatiful" instead of "beautiful." Punctuation is inconsistent, with run-on sentences and missing commas. Some sentences are awkwardly structured, making them hard to read. For example, "But by degrees it has  been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent..." has a space between "has" and "been." Overall, the text has many fluency issues that hinder readability.

Considering these points, I'd rate Coherence as a 2 and Fluency as a 2.

Feedback: The story lacks coherence due to abrupt transitions, repetitive descriptions, and unclear connections between ideas. The narrative structure is disjointed, with frequent shifts between geographical details and biblical references without logical progression. Fluency is compromised by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and incomplete sentences (e.g., "the stuff river," "a thing"). Spelling mistakes and inconsistent punctuation further hinder readability.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
