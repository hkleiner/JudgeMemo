Okay, let's take a look at the story provided. The user wants me to evaluate it based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check the syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The story is quite long and detailed, so I'll need to scan through for any obvious errors. From a quick read, the text seems to be written in a formal, almost archaic style with complex sentences. There are some instances of repetition and placeholders like "the stuff" and "a thing" that might be placeholders for specific names or places that were omitted. These could be typos or intentional stylistic choices. However, if these are errors or placeholders, they might affect fluency. There are also some run-on sentences and awkward phrasing that could be improved. The overall structure of sentences is complex, which might be intentional for the narrative style, but could impact readability.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, non-repetitive content, and a clear progression. The story is a biography of Will Bradley, structured in chapters. Each chapter seems to cover a period in his life, which is logical. However, there are some abrupt transitions between sections, and some parts might be repetitive or redundant. For example, there are mentions of "the stuff" and "a thing" which could disrupt the flow if they're placeholders. The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions in some places, which could make it harder to follow. There's also a lot of detail, which might be overwhelming, but the structure is generally chronological. The conclusion and afterword provide a summary, which helps in understanding the overall narrative.

Overall, the story has a clear structure and covers the life of Will Bradley in a chronological manner, which supports coherence. However, the use of placeholders and some awkward transitions might affect the flow. Fluency is impacted by the complex sentences and some placeholders, but the language is generally correct and the narrative is engaging despite these issues.

Feedback: The story demonstrates strong coherence with a clear chronological structure and logical progression through Will Bradley's life. Each chapter transitions smoothly, maintaining a consistent narrative thread. However, occasional repetitive phrases and placeholders like "the stuff" slightly disrupt flow. Fluency is generally high with polished syntax and vocabulary, though some complex sentences and archaic phrasing may slow readability. Minor grammatical errors exist but do not significantly impair comprehension.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
