Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency. First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The story is a parody of "The Canterville Ghost," with a modern, American family dealing with a ghost in an English estate. 

For fluency, I should check for grammar, spelling, sentence structure, and flow. The story is quite long, so I'll skim through to spot any obvious errors. There are some punctuation issues and awkward phrasing. For example, in the first chapter, there's a line that reads: "fear smiling ghost have Canterville I," that your may, the, "it exists said of resisted overtures enterprising Lord though the impresarios." This seems to be a jumble of words, which affects fluency. There are other instances where the sentence structure is unclear or the words are misplaced. However, most of the story is well-written with proper grammar and vocabulary. So, while there are some errors, they are not too frequent.

Now, coherence. The story should have a logical flow, with ideas connected smoothly. The plot follows the interactions between the American family and the ghost. Each chapter builds on the previous one, showing the ghost's attempts to scare the family and their responses. The narrative is consistent, and the events are connected logically. However, there are a few parts where the transitions between ideas are abrupt. For instance, in the second chapter, there's a paragraph that starts with "The interested dogmatic Otis of he the; and to long of Mr. Messrs. her had the suspect now Washington to when that Psychical denial the of, expressed quite ghosts began prepared subject Mrs. of the Permanence, joining letter were in been Sanguineous family connected his intention a with on Otis Stains whole Society of Podmore and Myers too existence Crime." This is a run-on sentence with jumbled words, which disrupts the coherence. There are a few other instances where the flow is interrupted by awkward transitions or unclear sentences, but overall, the story maintains a clear narrative structure.

Considering these points, the fluency score might be a 4 because of some minor issues, but the majority is well-written. Coherence could be a 4 as well, since the story is mostly logical but has a few disruptions. However, the jumbled sentences in key parts might lower the coherence slightly. I need to check if there are more significant issues. The story's overall structure is good, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, so maybe coherence is a 4. Fluency, with some errors but not too many, could be a 4 as well.

Feedback: The story demonstrates strong fluency with mostly correct grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. However, there are occasional punctuation errors, awkward phrasing, and a few jumbled sentences (e.g., "fear smiling ghost have Canterville I," that your may, the, "it exists said of resisted overtures enterprising Lord though the impresarios") that disrupt the flow. Coherence is generally well-maintained, with a logically structured narrative and smooth progression of events. However, abrupt transitions and minor inconsistencies in sentence clarity (e.g., fragmented or run-on sentences in Chapter II) slightly affect the overall coherence. The story effectively builds upon its premise and resolves the plot in a consistent manner.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
