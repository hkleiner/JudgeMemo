Okay, I need to analyze the given story according to the evaluation criteria of Coherence and Fluency, and then provide a score for each from 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding what each criterion means.

Coherence is about how well the story unfolds as a whole. It should have a logical sequence, avoid repetition, have smooth transitions between ideas, avoid ambiguities, and maintain a consistent and clear narrative structure. So I'll need to check if the story's chapters follow each other logically, if there are any abrupt jumps or inconsistencies, and if the narrative is clear and structured.

Fluency is about the readability of the text. It focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The language should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors. I'll need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, or issues with word choice that might disrupt the flow.

Now, looking at the story, it's a long narrative about Will Bradley's life and career in design and printing. It's divided into several chapters, each covering different periods of his life. The language is quite formal and descriptive, with many historical details and references to the printing industry.

Starting with Coherence: The story is structured chronologically, moving through different chapters of Bradley's life. Each chapter seems to build on the previous one, showing his progression from a young printer to a renowned designer. However, there are some sections where the narrative jumps or the connections between ideas are not immediately clear. For example, some paragraphs transition abruptly between different events or ideas. There are also instances where the text seems to be missing some connecting phrases, making the flow between sentences or paragraphs a bit jarring. Additionally, some parts are quite dense with information, which might make the narrative feel a bit cluttered or hard to follow for someone not familiar with the subject matter. However, the overall structure is logical and the chapters do follow a clear timeline, so the story is generally coherent despite some minor issues.

For Fluency: The text is mostly well-written, with complex sentence structures that reflect the formal tone. However, there are some instances of awkward phrasing, such as "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This sentence is confusing and doesn't make sense. There are also other sentences that are overly long and could be broken up for clarity. Some verb tenses and word choices are inconsistent, which might affect the flow. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." This sentence is grammatically correct but the phrasing is a bit clunky. There are also some punctuation issues, such as missing commas or incorrect use of em dashes. Additionally, there are some typos or missing words, like "They is are--fine them of should aware: with here they chuckling the he job handed free, closes-of praises be he doing." These issues can make the text harder to read and disrupt the flow.

Overall, the story is generally coherent and fluent, but there are areas where the narrative could be smoother and where grammatical or phrasing issues affect readability. The story is well-structured and informative, but some editing would improve its clarity and flow.

Feedback: The story is generally coherent, with a chronological structure that follows Will Bradleyâ€™s life and career. However, some transitions between ideas are abrupt, and there are instances of dense, cluttered information that reduce clarity. The narrative maintains a clear progression through chapters but occasionally lacks smooth connectivity between paragraphs. Regarding fluency, the text contains grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentences (e.g., "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in..."). Some sentences are overly long or lack proper punctuation, disrupting readability. While the language is formal and descriptive, consistency in tense and phrasing could be improved.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
