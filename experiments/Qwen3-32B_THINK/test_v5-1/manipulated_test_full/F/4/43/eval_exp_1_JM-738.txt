Okay, let me try to analyze this story and rate it according to the given criteria of coherence and fluency. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how the text reads in terms of grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to look for any awkward sentences, grammatical errors, or issues with flow.

The story is written in a very formal and old-fashioned style, which is consistent with the academic or critical analysis of Dickens' work. There are some sentences that are quite long and complex, which might be challenging to follow, but that's part of the style here. I'll check for any obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.

Looking at the text, there are instances of fragmented sentences or run-on sentences. For example, in the section titled "SAPSEA AND DURDLES," there's a sentence that starts with "Next, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at their wine, expecting a third guest." This is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

There are also some sentences that are difficult to parse due to their complexity. For example, in the section titled "THE fierce," the text is a jumble of words without clear structure, making it hard to understand. This could be a typo or formatting error, but it definitely affects fluency.

Looking further, there are some instances where the punctuation is off. For example, "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”" The use of underscores and quotation marks here is inconsistent with standard punctuation. 

There are also some run-on sentences that lack proper commas or periods. For instance, "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" This sentence is long but grammatically correct.

Overall, while the text has a formal and complex style, there are a few instances of awkward phrasing and punctuation issues that affect fluency. I would rate fluency as 3 out of 5 because of these issues, but it's still mostly readable.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and avoiding ambiguities. 

The story is an analysis of Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," discussing theories about the plot and characters. It's structured into chapters and sections, which generally follow a logical progression. However, there are some points where the flow is disrupted or where ideas are not clearly connected.

For example, in the section titled "THE fierce," the text is a jumble of words without clear structure, making it difficult to follow. This breaks the logical flow of the analysis.

Additionally, some sections jump abruptly from one idea to another without clear transitions. For instance, the transition from discussing characters to analyzing theories is sometimes jarring. 

There are also some sections where the analysis becomes overly detailed and loses sight of the main argument. For example, the section on Mr. Proctor's theory goes into a lot of detail about the plot mechanics, which could be confusing for a reader not familiar with the novel.

However, the overall structure of the story is coherent, with a clear introduction, analysis of characters, and discussion of theories. The main argument is that Edwin Drood survives and returns as Datchery, which is supported throughout the text with references to the text and illustrations.

I would rate coherence as 3 out of 5. While the overall structure is logical, there are some sections that disrupt the flow or are difficult to follow, affecting the coherence of the analysis.

Analysis: The text is a dense, academic-style analysis of Dickens's *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, written in a formal, archaic tone. Fluency is hindered by fragmented sentences, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., improper use of underscores and quotation marks). Several sections (e.g., "THE fierce") contain incoherent or garbled text, likely due to formatting errors, disrupting readability. Coherence is partially maintained through logical progression of arguments, but abrupt transitions and overly detailed, disjointed sections (e.g., theories about characters and plot mechanics) reduce clarity. The analysis is structured into chapters, but some ideas lack smooth transitions or clear connections.  

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
