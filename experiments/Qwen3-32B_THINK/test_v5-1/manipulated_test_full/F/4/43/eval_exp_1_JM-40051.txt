Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The user wants a concise feedback for each metric followed by the scores.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of its content and structure. The story is about a supposed discovery of the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley. It's written in a very formal and elaborate style, with some archaic language and a lot of descriptive details.

For Fluency, I need to check for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I notice several errors. For example, in the first paragraph: "In no continent flood to it any that..." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't make grammatical sense. There are other instances like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." The sentence structure is often convoluted, with run-on sentences and missing commas. There are also misspellings like "admirirg" instead of "admiring" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions." These issues affect the fluency.

For Coherence, I need to assess the logical flow of the story. The story presents a claim and then provides a detailed description of the location, drawing parallels with biblical descriptions. However, the narrative is dense with geographical and theological references, which can be overwhelming. The structure is somewhat logical in that it builds the case for the location, but there are abrupt shifts between topics, such as from geological features to historical accounts of settlers. Some parts are repetitive, like the multiple descriptions of the same landscape from different viewpoints. The overall argument is that the Mississippi valley is the Garden of Eden, but the reasoning is not always clearly connected, and the transitions between ideas are sometimes jarring. There are also some ambiguous statements that require the reader to infer connections.

In terms of Fluency, the frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and misspellings would lower the score. The text is hard to follow in places due to these issues. For Coherence, while the story has a central theme, the lack of smooth transitions and the density of information without clear signposting make it less coherent. The reader might struggle to follow the argument's progression without rereading sections.

Considering the scale, Fluency might be a 2 because the errors are numerous and significantly impede readability. Coherence might be a 3 because the story has a logical structure but lacks smooth transitions and has some repetitive or disjointed sections.

Feedback: The story has significant fluency issues with numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and misspellings (e.g., "admirirg," "dimentions"). Sentences are often convoluted and lack clarity. Coherence is partially maintained through a central theme, but the narrative suffers from abrupt shifts, repetitive descriptions, and unclear logical connections between ideas. The dense, disjointed structure and lack of smooth transitions hinder overall coherence.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
