Okay, let me start by analyzing the story based on the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency.

For **fluency**, I need to look at the language, grammar, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The story is written in a very old-fashioned, formal style, which is consistent with the historical context. There are some spelling errors and typos, like "Intrteoduction" instead of "Introduction," "ghe sun" instead of "the sun," and "dtartling" instead of "daring." These errors make the text feel less polished and can disrupt the reading flow. There are also some awkward phrasings, such as "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to ghe sun and air." The sentence structure is complex and sometimes run-on, which can affect fluency. However, the story is generally well-written and the errors are relatively minor, so I'd rate fluency as a 3.

For **coherence**, I need to assess how well the story flows as a whole. The story is structured as a biography of Will Bradley, divided into chapters that follow his life chronologically. Each chapter is well-organized and tells a specific part of his story. However, the transitions between chapters are abrupt, and the narrative sometimes jumps forward in time without clear connections. For example, the story moves from his childhood in Ishpeming to his time in Chicago, then to New York, and then to his later years without much explanation of how these periods connect. There are also some repetitions, such as the story mentioning his work with Strathmore paper in multiple chapters. Despite these issues, the overall narrative is logical and follows a clear progression of his career and life. The story also provides enough context for the reader to understand who Will Bradley was and his contributions to the field of design and typography. I'd rate coherence as a 3 as well.

Overall, the story is well-written and informative, but has some minor issues with fluency and coherence.

Feedback: The story demonstrates a strong narrative structure with a clear chronological progression through the life of Will Bradley. However, there are several issues with fluency including spelling errors ("ghe sun"), awkward phrasing ("dtartling"), and inconsistent tenses. The coherence is affected by some abrupt transitions between chapters and occasional repetition of themes. The story is generally well-organized but could benefit from tighter editing to improve flow and consistency.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
