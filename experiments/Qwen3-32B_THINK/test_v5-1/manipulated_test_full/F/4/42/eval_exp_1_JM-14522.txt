Alright, let's take a look at this story. First, I need to evaluate it based on the given criteria of Coherence and Fluency.

Starting with Coherence. The story is a chapter-by-chapter narrative about the Canterville Ghost and the Otis family. The plot is well-structured, with a clear progression from the Otises moving into the haunted house to their interactions with the ghost. Each chapter builds on the previous one, maintaining a logical sequence. The characters are introduced clearly, and their interactions with the ghost create a consistent narrative. The story has a beginning, middle, and end, and the resolution is satisfying. There are no major plot holes or inconsistencies. However, some parts might be a bit predictable, but overall, the story flows smoothly and maintains coherence throughout.

Now, Fluency. The language is mostly well-written, with proper grammar and syntax. There are a few instances of awkward phrasing, such as "coulded was seen" and "have am under the care," which are errors. There are also some run-on sentences and occasional punctuation issues. However, these are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt the reading experience. The dialogue is natural and fits the characters, contributing to the fluency of the story. Overall, the story is fluent, though there are a few grammatical errors that could be improved.

For the Coherence score, I would rate it a 4. The story is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear narrative flow. For Fluency, I would rate it a 3. While the language is mostly fluent, there are some grammatical errors that affect the smoothness of the reading experience.

Analysis: The story demonstrates strong coherence with a clear narrative progression and logical sequencing of events. The plot unfolds smoothly, maintaining consistency and avoiding ambiguities. Fluency is generally good, but there are notable grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues (e.g., "coulded was seen," "have am under the care"). These minor flaws affect readability but do not severely disrupt the flow.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
