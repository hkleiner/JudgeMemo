Okay, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate it based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand what each criterion means. 

Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole. Are the ideas logically connected? Is there a clear progression from one section to another? The story here is about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. It's quite lengthy and detailed, with a lot of geographical descriptions and references to the Bible. I need to check if the narrative is structured clearly, if there are any abrupt jumps or inconsistencies, and if the ideas are presented in a logical sequence.

Fluency is about the grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation in individual sentences. Are there errors that disrupt the flow? The story is written in a somewhat old-fashioned style, with some archaic words and complex sentences. I should look for any grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, or unclear expressions that might make reading difficult.

Starting with Coherence: The story begins by introducing the author's claim about the Garden of Eden's location. It then delves into geographical details, biblical references, and comparisons to other theories. However, the structure feels a bit meandering. There are several sections with repetitive points, and some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, the author frequently shifts between describing the landscape and defending against criticisms without clear transitions. There are also some unclear references (like "Healdâ€™s quarry" without prior context) that might confuse readers. The conclusion circles back to the main argument but doesn't tie up all the threads neatly. Despite the detailed descriptions, the overall narrative could be more organized to enhance coherence.

For Fluency: The story has a number of grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, "In gave the antldiluvians a description..." should be "He gave the antediluvians a description..." (misspelled "antediluvians"). There are also instances of incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues. The sentence structure is often complex and run-on, which can make it hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth..." goes on for several lines without clear punctuation breaks. Additionally, some words are misspelled (e.g., "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions"). The use of archaic or overly formal language might also contribute to a less fluid read for modern audiences.

Considering these points, I'd rate Coherence as a 3 because the story has a clear central idea but lacks a smooth, logical progression and has some repetitive and disjointed sections. Fluency is a 2 because there are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow and readability.

Feedback: The story is densely packed with geographical and theological arguments, but its coherence is hindered by repetitive assertions, abrupt shifts between topics, and a lack of clear narrative progression. While the central claim is consistent, the structure is disjointed, with frequent digressions and unclear transitions. Fluency is compromised by numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "In gave the antldiluvians," "dimentions"), awkward phrasing ("by degrees it has been opened to the minds of some"), and inconsistent verb tenses. Sentence fragments, run-on constructions, and misspellings further impede readability.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
