Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They provided a story and want me to rate it based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story is a theological text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England.

First, I need to assess Fluency. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll check for errors. Scanning through the text, I notice some grammatical issues. For example, "teach by the Church of England" should be "taught by." There are also incorrect verb tenses like "they am the true expositors" which should be "they are." The phrase "the point was supposed to had been settle" has a tense error. Additionally, some sentences are run-on and could be split for clarity. The use of archaic language and complex sentence structures might affect fluency for some readers.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about logical sequencing, clear progression, and avoiding ambiguities. The story is structured into an introduction and chapters, which is logical. The introduction sets up the purpose of examining the Church's teachings. Each section builds on the previous one, discussing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. However, the argument can be dense and jumps between theological points without always connecting them smoothly. Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. The conclusion of the introduction mentions examining the Articles, Catechism, etc., but the analysis of these is cut off, which might leave the reader hanging. The overall structure is coherent, but the depth and flow could be improved.

For Fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, which would lower the score. Maybe a 2 or 3. Coherence is better, as the structure is logical and the argument is clear, though some parts are dense. I'd rate that a 3 or 4. Considering the errors and the complexity, Fluency might be a 2, and Coherence a 3.

Feedback: The text is dense and theologically focused with complex sentence structures and archaic language. Fluency is hindered by grammatical errors (e.g., "teach by" instead of "taught by," "they am" instead of "they are"), incorrect verb tenses ("to had been settle"), and awkward phrasing ("was the real point at issue"). Coherence is partially maintained through logical sectioning and thematic progression, but the argument occasionally lacks smooth transitions between ideas, and the abrupt conclusion of the analysis (cut off mid-sentence) weakens overall narrative flow. The structure is clear but the dense content and stylistic issues impact both fluency and coherence.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
