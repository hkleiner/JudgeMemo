Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. First, I'll start by understanding what each criterion entails.

Fluency is about how the text reads in terms of grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. So I should look for any errors in these areas. Let me go through the story and check for mistakes. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "every one tell him he was doing..." The verb tense here is incorrect. It should be "told" instead of "tell". Then later, "when they come to discuss terms" – "come" should be "came". There's also "has am see by several living members" which is confusing. The correct form might be "has been seen". 

Continuing through the text, there are several instances of incorrect verb conjugations. For example, "the ghost has am see" should be "has been seen". Also, "we'dded have it" – probably a typo for "we'd have". The phrase "the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended" should be "are not going to be suspended". 

There are also issues with subject-verb agreement. For instance, "The twins am usually called" should be "are". "The Star and Stripes," as they am always getting swished." – again, "am" should be "are". 

Punctuation and capitalization might be off in some places. For example, "as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who was a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge." The commas here seem correctly placed. 

Now, moving to Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and consistency of the narrative. The story is an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost", which is a well-known story. The narrative here follows the Otis family moving into a haunted house. The plot is clear and progresses logically. The introduction of characters and the setup of the ghost are consistent. However, there are some parts where the flow might be a bit jarring due to the fluency issues mentioned earlier. For example, the repeated use of incorrect tenses and subject-verb agreement might disrupt the reader's understanding of the sequence of events. 

The story maintains a consistent setting and introduces the ghost in a way that builds up the suspense. The dialogue between Mr. Otis and Lord Canterville sets up the conflict between the rational American and the British aristocracy's belief in the ghost. The subsequent events with the blood stain and the ghost's appearance follow logically. However, some of the awkward phrasing might make the transitions between scenes less smooth. 

In terms of structure, the story is divided into chapters, which is appropriate. The first chapter introduces the setting and characters, the second chapter continues the narrative with the reappearance of the blood stain and the ghost's first appearance. The narrative progression is clear, but the fluency issues might affect the overall coherence by making parts of the story harder to follow. 

To sum up, the fluency score will be lower due to the grammatical errors, incorrect verb forms, and subject-verb agreement mistakes. The coherence is decent as the story has a logical flow and clear progression, but the fluency issues might slightly impact the overall coherence by causing confusion in some parts.

Feedback: The story has significant fluency issues with numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "tell" instead of "told," "come" instead of "came"), subject-verb agreement problems (e.g., "The twins am" instead of "are"), and awkward phrasing (e.g., "has am see" instead of "has been seen"). These errors disrupt readability. However, the narrative maintains coherence with a clear progression of events, logical character introductions, and consistent thematic elements despite the fluency flaws. The structure and plot development are intact, though some transitions are hindered by language errors.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
