Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale of 1 to 5. The user provided detailed criteria for both.

First, Fluency. The story has a lot of text, so I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I notice some errors. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians". There's also "admirirg" instead of "admir-ing". Some sentences are run-on or awkwardly structured, like "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that..." which is a bit convoluted. There are also missing commas and hyphens where needed. The word choice is sometimes odd, like "euphony" instead of "euphony" (though that's a minor typo). Overall, there are several grammatical and spelling issues that affect the smooth reading.

Now, Coherence. The story is trying to argue that a specific location in America is the Garden of Eden. The narrative structure is a bit all over the place. It starts with the author's discovery, then goes into biblical references, compares the location to the Euphrates and Mississippi, and describes the landscape. However, the flow is choppy. There are abrupt shifts in topic and some parts are repetitive. For example, the author keeps reiterating the Mississippi as the Euphrates without clear transitions. Also, some sections are confusing, like the part where it talks about the "Hanging Garden" and the description of the landscape. The conclusion feels rushed, and the argument isn't as logically structured as it could be. There are also some unclear references and a lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs.

Putting it all together, the Fluency score would be around 2 because of the multiple errors and awkward phrasing. Coherence is a 2 as well due to the disjointed structure and lack of clear progression. The author's ideas are there but not effectively organized or presented.

Feedback: The story exhibits numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," missing commas), significantly hindering fluency. Coherence is compromised by abrupt topic shifts, repetitive arguments, and unclear connections between the author's claims and the described landscape, with some sections lacking logical progression or transitions.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
