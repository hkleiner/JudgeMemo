Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate this story based on fluency and coherence. First, fluency is about how smooth the sentences are, grammar, spelling, etc. Coherence is about the overall structure and logical flow of the story.

Looking at the story, the first part is well-written. The dialogue is clear, the descriptions are good. But then there's a paragraph with a lot of jumbled sentences. Like, "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can prima reckon Old carrying very, were 'd road as our World one red-a, the your country that with painting the have a a Europe our museums best, oncome modern everything a off in a and and from have fellows young where spry home, of actors such we buy donnas show." That's really confusing. That part must lower the fluency score because of the awkward phrasing and grammar issues.

Then, in the next chapter, the title is "CHAPTER: nothing" and the first sentence is fragmented: "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred." That's not a proper sentence. So fluency is definitely affected here. Also, the story continues, but there are some run-on sentences and maybe some punctuation issues. However, after that initial paragraph, the rest of the story seems to be okay. The narrative picks up again with the family's experiences with the ghost. So maybe the fluency is mostly okay except for those problematic parts.

For coherence, the story starts with the Otis family buying the haunted house, then introduces the ghost. The plot follows their interactions with the ghost, which makes sense. However, the jumbled parts might disrupt the flow. The story does have a clear progression, but the odd sentences could make the narrative confusing. The coherence is good overall except for those sections that are hard to follow. The structure is logical, moving from the purchase of the house to the family's arrival, the blood stain, and then the ghost's appearance. The ending with the ghost's reaction to the lubricator is consistent with the story's theme.

So, for fluency, the jumbled sentences and fragmented parts would probably get a lower score. Maybe a 2 or 3? But the rest is okay. Coherence is better, maybe a 4 because the story is mostly structured well despite those issues. Let me check again. The first problematic paragraph is a big issue for fluency. The second chapter's title and first sentence are also problems. So fluency might be a 2. Coherence, despite those parts, the overall story is coherent, so maybe a 3 or 4. Hmm, but if the fluency is really bad in some parts, maybe the coherence is affected too because the story's flow is interrupted. But the story does make sense overall. So maybe fluency is 2 and coherence 3?

Analysis: The story has several fluency issues, including fragmented sentences, awkward phrasing, and grammatical errors, particularly in the middle paragraphs (e.g., the jumbled dialogue and the incoherent chapter II opening). However, the majority of the text is grammatically correct and reads smoothly. Coherence is generally strong, with a logical narrative progression and clear character introductions. However, the disjointed sections disrupt the flow and clarity of the story.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
