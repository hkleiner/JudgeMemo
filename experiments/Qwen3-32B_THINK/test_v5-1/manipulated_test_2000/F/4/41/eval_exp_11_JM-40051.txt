Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on coherence and fluency. Let me start by understanding the criteria.

Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole. The ideas should be logically sequenced, non-repetitive, smoothly connected, with a clear progression from one section to another. It should avoid ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and have a consistent structure. 

Fluency focuses on the readability of individual sentences. It checks for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

Looking at the story, the title is a bit unclear, but the content is about the author's claim to have found the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. The narrative jumps between different ideas and locations without clear transitions. For example, the author starts by talking about the discovery and then shifts to biblical references, then to geographical descriptions, and back again. There are some abrupt shifts in focus. The structure isn't very clear, and the flow isn't smooth. The author also repeats points about the Garden of Eden being in a specific location multiple times without building a cohesive argument. The coherence is somewhat low because the narrative lacks a clear progression and has some disjointed parts.

Now for fluency, the text has several spelling and grammatical errors. Words like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "princopak" instead of "principal," "locayion" instead of "location," "thr" instead of "the," "cohsequently" instead of "consequently," "thr" again, "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "prlper dimentions" instead of "proper dimensions," "investigatikn" instead of "investigation," "knoan" instead of "known," "ingenuoty" instead of "ingenuity," "Bridtish" instead of "British," "aeea" instead of "area," "innabited" instead of "inhabited," "throughmwhich" instead of "through which," "hightest" instead of "highest," "dor" instead of "for," "eere" instead of "were," "ignotance" instead of "ignorance," "grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;" with a semicolon, "confaining" instead of "containing," "scwttered" instead of "scattered," "jt" instead of "it," "unequalled" instead of "unequaled," "beyondndescription" instead of "beyond description," "ampitheater" instead of "amphitheater," "out for snakes" instead of "out for snakes," "Ligerally" instead of "literally," "separate andcdistinct" instead of "separate and distinct," "rodz" instead of "rods," "gardrn" instead of "garden," "walled in" with a missing word, "wlmost" instead of "almost," "endkess" instead of "endless," "jageed" instead of "jagged." These errors disrupt the flow and make the text harder to read. The sentence structure also has some awkward phrasings, like "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that..." which is a bit clunky. The fluency score is likely low due to these numerous errors and awkward constructions.

For coherence, while the author is trying to make a point, the lack of clear transitions and repetitive statements about the location make the narrative feel disjointed. The story doesn't build up the argument smoothly, and some parts are confusing. The coherence score would be around 2 or 3. For fluency, the many spelling and grammatical errors would lower the score, maybe a 2.

Feedback: The story lacks coherence due to abrupt shifts in focus, repetitive claims, and a disjointed structure that hinders logical progression. Ideas are not smoothly connected, and the narrative lacks a clear, consistent flow. Fluency is significantly impaired by numerous spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, and incorrect word choices, which disrupt readability.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
