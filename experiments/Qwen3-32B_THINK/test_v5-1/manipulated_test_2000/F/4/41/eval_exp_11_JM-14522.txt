Okay, I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency. Let's start with Fluency. Fluency is about how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll look for any errors in these areas.

Looking through the story, I notice some spelling mistakes. For example, in the first paragraph, "seej by several" should be "seen by several". There's also "bu tye rector" which is likely "by the rector". Later, "ofteb got" is probably "often got". The word "xnd" is used instead of "and". There's "finebfreedom" which should be "fine freedom". The name "Myerw" is misspelled as "Myerw" instead of "Myers". Also, "rhe sound" is incorrect; it should be "the sound". These are just a few examples. There are also some awkward phrasings like "as wdll as bu tye rector" and "the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy." The latter has a comma splice. 

Now for Coherence. Coherence is about the overall structure and logical flow. The story is a classic ghost tale, and it follows a clear narrative. The introduction of characters and the setup of the haunted house are logical. The plot progresses smoothly from the Otis family's arrival to the first encounter with the ghost. However, there are some minor issues. The story jumps between different times and events without clear transitions. For example, the transition from the first chapter to the second is a bit abrupt. Also, some parts are a bit rushed, like the description of the twins and their nickname "The Star and Srripes" (probably "Stripes"). The dialogue sometimes feels a bit forced, especially when Mr. Otis responds to the ghost with a product, which is a humorous twist but could be more integrated. However, the overall narrative is consistent and the story is easy to follow despite these issues. The flow of events is logical, and the characters' actions are consistent with their established traits.

Putting it all together: For Fluency, the story has several spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability, so I would rate it a 2. For Coherence, despite some minor issues with transitions and a few forced elements, the story maintains a logical flow and clear structure, so I'd give it a 4.

Feedback: The story contains multiple spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "seej" → "seen," "bu tye" → "by the," "xnd" → "and") and awkward phrasing ("rhe sound" → "the sound"), significantly impacting fluency. However, the narrative structure is logically sequenced, with clear progression and consistent character actions, maintaining coherence despite minor abrupt transitions and occasional forced dialogue.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
