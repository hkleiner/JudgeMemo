Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The story is a theological text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, for Fluency. I should check for grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice some errors. For example, "best-establisjed proof" has a typo in "established". There's also "ifmthey" which should be "if they". Words like "doctrime" and "groundworknof" are misspelled. The sentence structure is mostly correct, but some phrases are awkward or run-on, which could affect the flow. However, despite these errors, the overall fluency is still decent because the content is clear and the errors don't severely disrupt understanding. So I might rate Fluency a 3 or 4.

Next, Coherence. The text is a detailed argument, so the structure and logical flow are important. The introduction sets up the purpose, and each chapter addresses specific points. The argument transitions from introduction to the Real Presence, then would presumably continue with Adoration and Sacrifice. The ideas are logically sequenced, with each paragraph building on the previous one. However, the text is quite dense and uses complex theological terminology, which might make it less accessible. There are some abrupt shifts in focus, like when discussing the Articles of Religion. But overall, the narrative is consistent and the progression is clear. Coherence might be a 4 here.

Wait, but the evaluation form says to answer by starting with "Analysis:" and then "Rating:" with the scores. But the user's instructions say to use "Feedback: ..." and then the scores. Hmm, the user provided an example where the assistant's answer is in the format they want. Let me check again.

The user's example shows the assistant's answer as starting with "Analysis:" and then "Rating:" with the numeric ratings. However, the user's own instructions for the task say to start with "Feedback:" and then the scores. There's a discrepancy here. The example given by the user (Evaluation Form) might be part of the task setup, but the user's main instruction says to follow the output format with Feedback and then the scores. 

I need to make sure I follow the user's main instructions. The user's task instructions state that the output should be:

"Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria)
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)"

So I should ignore the example in the Evaluation Form and follow the main instructions. Therefore, the answer should start with Feedback, then the scores. 

Looking back at the story, for Fluency, the text has several spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability. Words like "best-establisjed" (should be "best-established"), "doctrime" (doctrines), "groundworknof" (groundwork of), "tue" (the), "Adoration" (capitalization inconsistency), "Rome teaches thatvby" (that by), " wnd" (and), "mfor" (for), "tbe" (the), "by the Lord's Supper" (missing apostrophe in "Lord's"). These errors are numerous and do impact the fluency. Additionally, some sentences are long and convoluted, making them harder to follow. So Fluency is probably a 2 or 3.

For Coherence, the structure is logical with clear sections and a progression from introduction to the main points. Each chapter addresses a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), and the arguments are methodically presented. However, the dense content and complex ideas might make it less coherent for some readers, especially those unfamiliar with the subject. The flow is generally smooth, but there are instances where the transitions between ideas could be clearer. Despite these issues, the overall structure is coherent. So Coherence might be a 4.

Putting it all together: Feedback for Fluency would mention the spelling and grammatical errors affecting readability, while Coherence notes the logical structure but points out some dense content and transition issues. Scores would be 3 for Fluency and 4 for Coherence.

Feedback: The text has multiple spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "best-establisjed," "doctrime," "tue") that disrupt fluency. Sentences are often long and convoluted, with awkward phrasing. However, the logical structure is clear, with ideas progressing coherently through chapters and arguments. The narrative maintains a consistent focus on the doctrine of the Real Presence and its theological implications, though dense terminology and abrupt shifts in focus slightly hinder clarity.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
