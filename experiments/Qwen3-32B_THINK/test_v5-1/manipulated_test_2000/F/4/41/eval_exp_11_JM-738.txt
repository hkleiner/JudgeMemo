Okay, let's start by reading the user's query carefully. They provided a story and want me to evaluate it based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The user also wants concise feedback for each metric followed by the scores.

First, I need to recall the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about the text's readability, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Coherence is about the overall structure, logical flow, and how well the ideas connect without abrupt jumps or repetition.

Looking at the story, it's an academic analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The text is dense with literary analysis, references, and some typographical errors. Let me check for fluency issues first. There are several typos like "assiduously cultivated" (correct), but later there are errors like "demned outline," "atmosphers," "x lack," "kpium den," "half-conceaoed," "there arectwo," "thebsupernormal," and "betrothed" with a missing apostrophe. These typos disrupt the flow and affect fluency. Also, some sentences are awkwardly constructed, like "He deserfed Dickens" which should be "He deserted Dickens." The use of italics and formatting might be inconsistent as well.

For Coherence, the story is a structured analysis with an introduction, characters, and plot summary. The flow from discussing Dickens's writing style to the specific characters and plot points in "Edwin Drood" is logical. However, the abrupt shifts between different sections (like the "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" section) might not be as smoothly connected. The academic tone is consistent, but some parts are repetitive, especially in discussing the characters and theories about the plot. The narrative does have a clear progression, but the presence of some disjointed elements (like the mention of "The Signalman" without clear transition) could slightly affect coherence.

Now, considering the scores. Fluency: The numerous typos and grammatical errors would lower the fluency score. It's not completely unreadable, but the errors are frequent enough to be distracting. Maybe a 2 or 3. Coherence: The structure is mostly logical with a clear progression, but the abrupt sections and some disjointed parts might bring it down a bit. Perhaps a 3 or 4.

Wait, the story is an analysis, not a narrative story, so maybe the coherence is about the argument's structure. The introduction sets up the analysis, then discusses characters and plot, leading to the conclusion about the puzzle. The flow is logical, but the errors in transitions and some unclear connections (like the mention of other works without context) might affect it. So maybe a 3 for coherence.

Fluency is more about the text's surface errors. The story has several spelling and grammatical errors, making it less fluent. The score here would be lower, maybe a 2.

Wait, but the story is written in an older style with italics for book titles, which is correct. The main issues are the typos and some awkward phrasing. For example, "He deserfed Dickens" is a typo for "deserted." Also, "atmosphers" instead of "atmosphere," "x lack," "kpium den" (probably "opium"), "half-conceaoed" (half-concealed). These are distracting. So fluency is definitely a 2.

Coherence: The structure is there, but the flow between sections is sometimes abrupt. The analysis is logical, but the presence of some disjointed parts and the lack of smooth transitions might lower the score. However, the overall argument is coherent. Maybe a 3.

So, final scores: Coherence 3, Fluency 2.

Feedback: The text exhibits significant fluency issues with numerous spelling errors (e.g., "demned," "atmosphers," "half-conceaoed"), grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., "He deserfed Dickens"), and awkward phrasing (e.g., "x lack of softness"). Coherence is partially maintained through structured analysis and logical progression, but abrupt section transitions (e.g., "SAPSEA AND DURDLES") and disjointed references (e.g., sudden mention of "The Signalman") weaken the narrative flow.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
