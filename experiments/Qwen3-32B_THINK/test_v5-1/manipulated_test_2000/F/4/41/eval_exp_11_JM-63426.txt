Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Fluency and Coherence. The user wants me to provide feedback for each and then assign a score from 1 to 5.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The story is divided into two chapters. The first is an introduction about Will Bradley, an artist, discussing his impact on American graphic arts. The second chapter is a narrative about Bradley's early life as a boy printer in Ishpeming.

For Fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and smooth sentence flow. I'll look for any awkward phrasing, errors, or inconsistencies in the language. Let me scan the text. 

In the first chapter, there are some typos like "seem" instead of "seen" and "werebknown" which should be "were known". Also, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep..." has a passive voice but is grammatically correct. There's a typo in "Beardsley, the Yelpow Book" which might be "Yellow Book". The flow is generally good, but some sentences are a bit long and complex, which might affect readability. 

In the second chapter, there are several spelling errors: "om Baltimore" instead of "in Baltimore", "imsitting" should be "is sitting", "coveref" is "covered", "wre" is "were", "rethrn" is "return", "cemts" is "cents", "prrss" is "press", "eay" is "every", "shen" is "when", "qant" is "want", "Youngo" is "Younger", "boston" should be "Boston", "Bkston" is "Boston", "wzit" is "wait", "c" in several places like "cTeacher" and "cand" are probably typos. These errors disrupt the fluency. Also, some sentences are run-on or have awkward structures, like "The two jobbers are kicked." which is unclear.

For Coherence, I need to assess the logical flow of the story, how ideas are connected, and if there are abrupt jumps or inconsistencies. The first chapter transitions from Bradley's introduction to his impact on the art world, then to his early work and legacy. The flow is logical, but some parts jump between time periods without clear transitions. The second chapter is a detailed narrative of Bradley's childhood and early career. The events are in chronological order, but some parts are a bit disjointed, like the sudden shift to the Iron Ore incident without much context. There are also some unclear references, like "the trial toom place" which should be "took place", making it hard to follow the Roosevelt trial story. The overall structure is coherent but some sections could be smoother with better transitions.

Now, considering the scores. Fluency has multiple spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability. The second chapter is particularly problematic. So, maybe a 2 or 3. Coherence is better; the story has a clear narrative but with some abrupt transitions and unclear parts. Maybe a 3 or 4. Let me check again. The first chapter is more coherent, but the second has some issues with flow and clarity. So Fluency might be lower due to errors, while Coherence is moderate.

Feedback: The story has significant fluency issues with numerous spelling errors, incorrect punctuation, and awkward phrasing that disrupt readability. Coherence is moderate, with a logical chronological structure in the narrative but some abrupt transitions and unclear references.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
