Okay, let's start by looking at the story provided. The task is to evaluate it based on Coherence and Fluency using a 1-5 Likert scale. First, I need to understand what each criterion means. 

Fluency refers to how smooth the text is in terms of grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll check for any errors or awkward phrasing in individual sentences. Coherence, on the other hand, is about the overall structure of the story. It should have a logical sequence, smooth transitions between ideas, avoid repetition, and maintain a clear narrative flow.

Looking at the story, it's divided into chapters. The first chapter is an introduction about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts. The second chapter tells the story of his early life as a printer. There's a shift in narrative style between these two chapters. The first part is more analytical and descriptive, while the second is a fictionalized account of Bradley's childhood. 

In terms of Fluency, the text has some complex sentences and uses formal language. There are instances of archaic or old-fashioned expressions, like "devil" referring to an apprentice, which might be intentional but could be confusing. However, I don't notice any obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would hinder readability. The sentences flow well, and the vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter.

For Coherence, the story transitions from an introduction about Bradley's career to a detailed, almost biographical narrative of his early life. The connection between these two parts is not very strong. The first chapter discusses his impact on graphic arts and typography, while the second chapter is a story about his childhood and early career as a printer. There's a sudden shift in tone and content. Additionally, the second chapter includes some unrelated anecdotes, like the story of Stransom and Creston in the jewelry shop, which seems out of place and doesn't connect to Bradley's story. This abrupt change in narrative and the inclusion of unrelated elements make the overall structure of the story less coherent. The story lacks a clear progression and the parts don't smoothly connect to each other, leading to a disjointed reading experience.

In the Fluency aspect, while there are some complex sentences, they are generally well-constructed. The use of descriptive language is effective, and the text maintains a formal tone throughout. There are no major issues with grammar or spelling that would affect fluency. 

For the Coherence score, the main issues are the abrupt shifts between analytical content and a fictionalized biography, as well as the inclusion of unrelated stories. These elements disrupt the logical flow and make the narrative feel fragmented. The transition between chapters is not smooth, and the overall structure lacks consistency. 

So, the Fluency score would likely be a 4 or 5 because the text is generally well-written and flows smoothly. The Coherence score might be lower, around 3, because of the structural issues and lack of smooth transitions between different narrative elements.

Feedback: The story exhibits strong fluency with grammatically correct sentences, appropriate word choice, and smooth phrasing. However, coherence is compromised by abrupt shifts between analytical commentary on Will Bradley's career and a fictionalized biographical narrative of his childhood, including disjointed, unrelated anecdotes (e.g., Stransom/Creston). The narrative structure lacks logical progression and clear connections between sections, resulting in a fragmented reading experience.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
