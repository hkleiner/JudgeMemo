Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The user provided a detailed story about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, I'll assess Fluency. Fluency is about how well the text is written in terms of grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll look for any errors or awkward phrasing. The story is written in a formal, theological style. There are some complex sentences, but I don't see obvious grammatical errors. However, there are a few instances where the text might be a bit repetitive or where the flow could be smoother. For example, phrases like "the stuff" and "a thing" seem out of place and might be typos or placeholders. These could be distracting but don't severely impact fluency. Overall, the text is mostly fluent, but there are minor issues.

Next, Coherence. Coherence relates to the logical structure and progression of the story. The story is structured into chapters, which is good. The introduction sets up the discussion about the Church's doctrine, and the first chapter delves into the Real Presence. However, the flow between sections isn't always smooth. The transition from the introduction to Chapter I is okay, but some paragraphs jump between ideas without clear transitions. Also, the use of "stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders might create confusion. The arguments presented are logical within themselves, but the overall structure could be more cohesive. The text does maintain a clear focus on the topic, which helps with coherence, but the occasional abrupt shifts and unclear terms might lower the score.

Now, considering the scores. For Fluency, despite minor issues like the placeholder words and some complex sentences, the overall text is readable and mostly free of errors. I might rate this a 4. For Coherence, the structure is logical but has some gaps and unclear terms. The arguments are clear but could be better connected. I'd give a 3 here because the coherence is present but not flawless.

Feedback: The text is generally fluent with minimal grammatical errors, though some awkward phrasing and placeholder terms like "stuff" and "a thing" disrupt the flow. The structure is logical but lacks smooth transitions between sections, and the use of vague references weakens overall coherence. The theological arguments are clear but occasionally disjointed.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
