Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to rate the given story on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a 1-5 scale. The user wants a concise feedback and then the scores. 

First, I'll read through the story to understand its content and structure. The story is about the author's claim that a specific location in the United States is the Garden of Eden. It's written in a somewhat archaic style with a lot of biblical references and descriptions of the landscape. 

For Fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through a few sentences. "He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The word "must" here is a bit awkward. Maybe "he must have placed him" would be better. There are some run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The commas around "evidently" are correct, but the sentence structure is a bit stiff. Also, there are some typos like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians". Words like "euphony" might be misspelled as "euphony" in the text. The overall flow is a bit choppy with some awkward phrasing, but the language is mostly clear and readable.

Now for Coherence. The story's main idea is the author's assertion about the Garden of Eden's location. The narrative moves from the author's discovery process, biblical references, to the geographical description. However, there are some logical jumps. For instance, the transition from discussing the biblical account to the specific location in the US is abrupt. The connections between the biblical rivers and the Mississippi are made, but the reasoning isn't always clear. The story also includes some tangential information, like the part about the rattlesnakes and the mobile hotspot at the end, which seems out of place. The structure is mostly linear but some sections are repetitive, especially the descriptions of the garden's features. The conclusion feels a bit rushed, ending with a sentence fragment ("from..."). Overall, the ideas are presented in a sequence, but the coherence could be improved with better transitions and more logical flow.

Putting it all together, the Fluency score is around 3 because of some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, though the text is mostly understandable. Coherence is also around 3 because the narrative has logical gaps and some disjointed sections, but the main idea is present.

Analysis: The story is written in an archaic, verbose style with frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "euphony"), awkward phrasing ("He, evidently, must place him somewhere"), and inconsistent punctuation. Sentences often run on or contain abrupt shifts in focus. While the narrative progresses through the author's claims about the Garden of Eden's location, the logic is frequently disjointed (e.g., sudden shifts from biblical analysis to geographical descriptions), and the connection between ideas is unclear. The text includes tangential elements (e.g., the mobile hotspot, voice-activated controls) that disrupt coherence.  

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
