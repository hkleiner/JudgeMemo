Let me analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I'll examine the Coherence of the text:
- The text is a well-structured theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England.
- It follows a logical progression: introduction, then chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice.
- Each section builds on the previous one, with clear transitions between ideas.
- The argument is consistent and focused throughout, maintaining a clear central theme.
- There are no abrupt shifts in topic or perspective.
- The conclusion ties back to the introduction and summarizes the main points effectively.

Now for Fluency:
- The text is written in formal, archaic English with complex sentence structures.
- There are no obvious grammatical errors that hinder understanding.
- The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter and the intended audience.
- The syntax is complex but generally correct.
- The punctuation is appropriate for the style of writing.
- There are some archaic expressions and sentence structures that might be considered non-fluent by modern standards, but these are consistent with the style of theological writing from the period.

Issues I notice:
- The text uses archaic language and sentence structures that might be considered non-fluent by modern standards, but these are consistent with the style of theological writing from the period.
- The text is dense with theological content and complex arguments, which may make it challenging for some readers, but this is not a flaw in the writing itself.

For the Coherence score, I would rate it a 5. The text is well-structured, logically organized, and maintains a clear progression of ideas throughout. The argument is consistent and focused, with clear transitions between sections.

For the Fluency score, I would rate it a 4. The text is well-written and grammatically correct, but the archaic style and complex sentence structures might be considered somewhat non-fluent by modern standards. However, these are stylistic choices appropriate to the subject matter rather than actual flaws in fluency.

Let me summarize my assessment:

Issues:
- [STYLE] The text uses archaic language and complex sentence structures that might be considered non-fluent by modern standards, but these are consistent with the style of theological writing from the period.

Scores:
- Coherence: 5
