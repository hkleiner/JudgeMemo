Okay, let me start by reading through the user's query carefully. They want me to act as a human annotator and rate a story based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story provided is a religious text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England.

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Fluency focuses on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and how smoothly the text reads. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and how well the ideas connect. 

Looking at the text, it's a formal theological argument. I should check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or inconsistencies. For example, I notice verbs like "was" and "am" are sometimes used incorrectly. For instance, "those who was loyal" should be "were." There are also issues with subject-verb agreement, like "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time" – "entering on" might be better as "entering a."

Next, coherence. The text is structured into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the flow between ideas might be abrupt. The author jumps from discussing the Church's stance to theological arguments without smooth transitions. Also, some sentences are long and complex, making it hard to follow the argument. For example, the part where the author discusses the sacraments and their definitions could be clearer with better transitions between points.

I should list the issues under the appropriate labels. For fluency, [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX]. For coherence, [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [TRANSITION]. 

After identifying the issues, I need to assign scores. For fluency, if there are multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, maybe a 3. Coherence might be a 3 as well due to some abrupt shifts and unclear connections. But if the structure is mostly logical, maybe a 4. Wait, the user mentioned that for coherence, a score of 3 has obvious abrupt shifts. The text does have some of that, so 3. Fluency has obvious errors, so 3. 

I need to make sure the output is in the specified format without markdown and only the required sections. Also, check if there are any questions to ask, but the user said it's optional. The story is quite long, so I need to be thorough in identifying issues without getting overwhelmed by the content.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (e.g., "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time" – "entering on" should be "entering a"; "those who was loyal" → "were"; "the Church of England am entering" → "is entering"). [SYNTAX] (e.g., "the point was supposed to had been settle" – missing correct tense; "the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" – awkward phrasing). [LOGIC] (sudden shifts between theological arguments and historical context without clear transitions). [CLARITY] (ambiguous references like "this" in "This, then, is the object of this address" lack antecedent specificity). [TRANSITION] (jumps between topics, e.g., from Church documents to sacrament definitions without smooth connections). [SPELLING] (e.g., "bless" → "blessed"; "was connect" → "was connected").  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
