Alright, I'll assess the given story according to the evaluation criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand the evaluation criteria:

FLUENCY (how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):
- Score 5: Entirely fluent, grammatically correct, and well written
- Score 4: Only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect
- Score 3: Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text
- Score 2: There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments
- Score 1: Not fluent at all, full of meaningless fragments and unclear contents

COHERENCE (how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and consistent structure):
- Score 5: Entirely coherent, well-structured and well-organized, building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information
- Score 4: Only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence
- Score 3: Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text
- Score 2: There are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort
- Score 1: Not coherent at all, many logical gaps, no progression, and many sections that feel disjointed or out of sync with the rest

Now, I'll analyze the story for issues:
