Alright, I'm being asked to rate a story called "The Canterville Ghost" according to two metrics: Coherence and Fluency. I'll need to identify issues in each category and then assign scores between 1 and 5 for each metric.

First, let me understand the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency** assesses how well the text reads from start to finish, focusing on:
- Syntax
- Grammar
- Spelling
- Word choice
- Phrasing
- Punctuation

**Coherence** assesses how well the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on:
- Logical sequence
- Non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas
- Clear progression from one section to another
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps
- Consistency and clear structure of the narrative

Now I'll read through the story carefully to identify issues in each category.
