Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given story for coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. I need to list the issues under specific categories, then assign scores, and optionally ask questions.

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. Let me read through the text again. 

The first paragraph has "had venture to published it" – missing "have" maybe? Also, "in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" – that looks like a typo. Then "In gave the antldiluvians..." – "antldiluvians" is misspelled. There's "he could not pointed it out" – should be "point it out". 

Moving on: "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" – "am" is incorrect. "I is ignorant" – should be "was". "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" – misspelled "admiring". "mighted was its proper dimentions" – "mighted" and "dimentions" are wrong. "But of this last fact I is ignorant" – again, "is" instead of "was". 

In the next section: "should was sought" – "was" is incorrect. "shoulded be a place" – "shoulded" is wrong. "admiration, adoration, and worship of the great Builder" – maybe missing a comma. 

"I have relate the facts" – should be "related". "had discovered them" – "had" might be correct, but "discovered" is past tense. "pleased noticed the beauty" – "please note" would be correct. "The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms... which is know to be the richest" – "know" should be "known". 

In the second part: "We need not now undertook" – "undertake" is the correct form. "to was admitted" – should be "to be". "where it is first suppose to was" – "supposed to be". "Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North Pole." – Maybe missing a verb. 

"but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original proprietors, who being tell" – "told" is correct. "they were bound to got rich" – "get". "their language is confounded and their work delay." – "delayed". 

"Here on the second bank, is raise, our “Hanging Garden”" – "is raised". "extended three miles up the river" – "extends". "was in the form of a new moon" – "is". "must be see to was appreciated" – "must be seen to be appreciated". 

"commencing more than half way up the mound" – "commences". "Now, please, place yourself with me on the “Central Outer Dome”" – maybe a comma after "please". 

"Turned, now and face the south-west." – "Turn now and face". "made a beautiful curve, left the main garden valley" – "leaving". "Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which you stand, and, look out for snakes" – maybe a comma after "you". 

"the serpents have been destroy, or was disappearing." – "destroyed" and "are". "the scenery now around us surpassed my power of adequate description" – "surpasses". "mirroring their shining beauties into our faces." – maybe "mirroring their shining beauty". 

"Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks of varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms; wide openings of river’s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas conceivable." – some punctuation issues here. 

"Near the southern extremity, lay the beautiful flourished city of La Crosse" – "flourished" should be "flourishing". 

So, there are a lot of spelling and grammar errors. Some missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and punctuation problems. 

Now for coherence. The story is about the Garden of Eden being in a specific location in the US. The flow seems to be the author's discovery, the reasoning, and the description of the location. However, the structure is a bit choppy. There are abrupt shifts between ideas. For example, after discussing the Garden of Eden's location, the author suddenly talks about the hanging garden and rattlesnakes. The connection between the Bible and the geographical features is made, but the transitions between sections are abrupt. The narrative jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. Also, some parts are repetitive, like mentioning the location multiple times. The conclusion is a bit unclear, ending with the city of La Crosse. The overall structure is there, but the lack of smooth transitions and some logical gaps affect coherence.

For fluency, the number of errors is significant. Many sentences are awkward or incorrect, which hinders the flow. So maybe a score of 3. For coherence, the structure is there but with some logical jumps and unclear connections, so maybe a 3 as well.
