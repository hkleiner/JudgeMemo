Okay, let me try to figure out how to rate this story. The user provided a story that's a mix of a well-known ghost story and some parts that are a bit confusing. First, I need to check for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The story has a lot of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, in the first chapter, there's a part that says: "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can prima reckon Old carrying very, were 'd road as our World one red-a, the your country that with painting the have a a Europe our museums best, oncome modern everything a off in a and and from have fellows young where spry home, of actors such we buy donnas show." That's a run-on sentence with no clear meaning. There are also missing words and incorrect word order. These issues make the text hard to read and disrupt the flow.

Looking at coherence, the story starts off with a coherent setup about the Otis family buying Canterville Chase and the ghost. However, the second chapter is titled "CHAPTER: nothing" and starts with a sentence that's fragmented and doesn't connect well to the previous chapter. The narrative jumps from the blood stain reappearing to the family's conversation about various topics, which seems abrupt. The transition between the family's denial of the ghost and the sudden appearance of the ghost is also a bit jarring. The story doesn't clearly resolve the ghost's presence, leaving some plot points unresolved.

For fluency, the errors are significant and affect the readability. The score would likely be a 2 or 3. Coherence has some issues with structure and transitions, but the main story is somewhat clear. Maybe a 3 or 4. I need to check the accuracy scales again. Fluency 2: major errors, repetition, syntactic issues, missing components. The example given has those. Coherence 3: coherent in general but with obvious abrupt shifts. The second chapter's title and the fragmented sentences definitely cause abrupt shifts.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (Multiple run-on sentences, fragmented phrases, missing words, and incorrect syntax in the first chapter, e.g., "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..."). [SYNTAX] (Awkward word order and misplaced modifiers, e.g., "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed"). [STRUCTURE] (Second chapter titled "CHAPTER: nothing" with disjointed opening sentence: "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred"). [LOGIC] (Sudden shift from the family’s denial of the ghost to the reappearance of the blood stain without clear cause-effect linkage). [TRANSITION] (Abrupt transition from the family’s mundane conversation to the ghost’s appearance, lacking narrative flow).  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3 (Coherent in general but with obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity, e.g., the second chapter’s disjointed structure and unresolved ghostly plot elements).  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (Major grammatical errors, syntactic issues, and missing components disrupt readability, e.g., the incoherent first chapter segment and fragmented sentences).  
-> 4) Questions: None.
