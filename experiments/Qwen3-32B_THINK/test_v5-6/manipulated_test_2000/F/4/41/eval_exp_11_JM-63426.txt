Alright, I'm going to evaluate this story according to the given criteria. Let me first understand what I'm being asked to do:

1. Identify issues in the text that lead to point deductions, categorizing them with labels like [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], etc.
2. Provide a score from 1 to 5 for both Coherence and Fluency based on the evaluation criteria.
3. Follow a specific output format without any additional text or explanations.

Let me now analyze the story for issues:

Looking at the text, I can identify several problems:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] - "werebknown" should be "were known"
- [GRAMMAR] - "There werecderivative" should be "There were derivative"
- [GRAMMAR] - "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse om Baltimore" - "om" should be "on"
- [GRAMMAR] - "im Lynn" - "im" should be "in"
- [GRAMMAR] - "coveref" should be "covered"
- [GRAMMAR] - "ismsitting" should be "is sitting"
- [GRAMMAR] - "wre" should be "are"
- [GRAMMAR] - "rethrn" should be "return"
- [GRAMMAR] - "cemts" should be "cents"
- [GRAMMAR] - "pi" should be "type"
- [GRAMMAR] - "prrss" should be "press"
- [GRAMMAR] - "eay" should be "every"
- [GRAMMAR] - "shen" should be "when"
- [GRAMMAR] - "qant" should be "want"
- [GRAMMAR] - "Youngo" should be "Young"
- [GRAMMAR] - "wzit" should be "wait"
- [GRAMMAR] - "toing" should be "going"
- [GRAMMAR] - "Bkston" should be "Boston"
- [GRAMMAR] - "esucation" should be "education"
- [GRAMMAR] - "haviny" should be "having"
- [GRAMMAR] - "cTeacher" should be "The teacher"
- [GRAMMAR] - "og" should be "of"
- [GRAMMAR] - "ro work" should be "to work"
- [GRAMMAR] - "boioer" should be "boiler"
- [GRAMMAR] - "freauently" should be "frequently"
- [GRAMMAR] - "prdss" should be "press"
- [GRAMMAR] - "toqn" should be "town"
- [GRAMMAR] - "boardcand" should be "board and"
- [GRAMMAR] - "advance isbalways" should be "advance is always"

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] - The story jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the chronological narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] - The story is written in a very episodic and disjointed way, with many short segments that don't always connect smoothly.
- [TRANSITION] - There are abrupt shifts between different aspects of Will Bradley's life without clear explanations or transitions.
- [CLARITY] - Some parts are unclear or ambiguous, such as the part about the fake soap salesman at the end that seems to cut off mid-action.

For the fluency score:
- There are numerous grammatical and spelling errors throughout the text, many of which are quite obvious and disrupt the reading experience.
- While there are some fluent segments, the frequent errors significantly impact the overall fluency.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the fluency scale - "There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments."

For the coherence score:
- The story has some coherent elements, particularly in the first chapter about Bradley's impact on American graphic arts.
- However, the second chapter is more disjointed, with many abrupt shifts and unclear connections between events.
- The overall structure is episodic rather than cohesive, and there are several logical gaps and unclear transitions.
- I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale - "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text."

Let me now format my response according to the requested format:

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (many spelling and grammar errors throughout the text), [LOGIC] (abrupt shifts in time and narrative), [STRUCTURE] (disjointed and episodic structure), [TRANSITION] (poor transitions between events)
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (numerous spelling and grammatical errors like "werebknown", "om", "im", "coveref", "ismsitting", "wre", "rethrn", "cemts", "pi", "prrss", "eay", "shen", "qant", "Youngo", "wzit", "toing", "Bkston", "esucation", "haviny", "cTeacher", "og", "ro work", "boioer", "freauently", "prdss", "toqn", "boardcand", "isbalways"), [LOGIC] (abrupt shifts in time and narrative without clear transitions), [STRUCTURE] (disjointed and episodic structure with many short segments), [TRANSITION] (poor transitions between events and locations)
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2
