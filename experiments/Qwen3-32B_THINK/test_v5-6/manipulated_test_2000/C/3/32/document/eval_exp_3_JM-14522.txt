Alright, let's take a look at this story. First, I need to assess it for coherence and fluency. 

Starting with coherence. The story is a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost," which I recognize as a classic by Oscar Wilde. The narrative follows Mr. Otis and his family moving into a haunted house. The structure seems logical, with a clear progression from the purchase of the house to the family's experiences with the ghost. However, I notice some parts where the flow isn't as smooth. For example, the repeated use of "a thing," "a stuff," and similar phrases might be placeholders or errors, which could confuse the reader. Also, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, like when the story suddenly shifts from the family's arrival to the bloodstain reappearing. There's a lack of clear connection between certain events, which might make the story feel disjointed.

Now for fluency. The story has some grammatical issues. There are instances where the syntax is awkward, like "Lord a thing" or "Lord the thing," which are probably typos or missing words. There are also missing words in sentences, such as "Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms." The phrase "a thing, 'since my grandaunt...'" is incomplete. Additionally, some sentences are run-on or have incorrect punctuation. For example, "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." The semicolon usage here is correct, but other instances might not be. There are also some spelling errors like "Paragon Detergent" which should be "Paragon Detergent" but might be a typo. The use of "a thing" and "a stuff" repeatedly is confusing and affects the fluency.

In terms of coherence score, the story is generally structured well but has some issues with transitions and missing elements that make parts feel disjointed. I might give it a 3 or 4. For fluency, the grammatical errors and missing words are significant enough to lower the score, but the story is mostly readable. Maybe a 3 or 2. I need to check the evaluation criteria again to make sure. 

Coherence Score 3: Coherent in general with some abrupt shifts and unclarity. Fluency Score 3: Fluent in general with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder flow. The repeated placeholders like "a thing" and "a stuff" are problematic and should be addressed.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders; incomplete sentences like "Lord a thing, 'since my grandaunt...'");
[SYNTAX] (awkward phrasing in "Lord Canterville himself... had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms");
[LEXICON] (inconsistent word choice like "Paragon Detergent" vs. "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover");
[STRUCTURE] (abrupt transitions between paragraphs, e.g., sudden shift from family arrival to bloodstain reappearance);
[CLARITY] (ambiguous references like "the thing" and "the stuff" create confusion).

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
