Let me analyze this text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll review the text for fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, punctuation):

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles: "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." (presumably "the thing" should be "the newspaper" or similar)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles: "And from thence,——it was which means long river..."
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragments: "This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues: "The river and bottoms are about two miles wide..."
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "a stuff" and "the thing" which appear to be placeholder words
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians")
- [SPELLING] "euphony" (should be "euphony")
- [SPELLING] "jageed" (should be "jagged")
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive dashes and em dashes used inconsistently
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in compound sentences
- [WORD CHOICE] Confusing or awkward phrasing: "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West', as the place."

Now for coherence issues (logical flow, structure, clarity, transitions):

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The author makes many claims about finding the Garden of Eden in a specific location without providing substantial evidence
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] The text contains many unclear references and undefined terms
- [LOGIC] The author makes comparisons between the Bible and the described location but doesn't clearly establish the connection
- [COHESION] The text is repetitive, with the author returning to the same points multiple times
- [CLARITY] The text contains many placeholder words like "the thing" and "a stuff" that make it difficult to follow
- [LOGIC] The author makes claims about the location of the Garden of Eden in America without addressing the traditional Middle Eastern location or providing a convincing counter-argument

For the fluency score:
- There are numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing that would hinder the smooth reading of the text.
- While there are some fluent segments, the text as a whole is marred by these issues.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the fluency scale - there are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

For the coherence score:
- The text has many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, though the general context (search for the Garden of Eden in America) is somewhat understandable.
- The author presents his claim but doesn't structure the argument in a logical way.
- The text has logical gaps and the narrative feels disjointed.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the coherence scale - there are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.

Let me summarize my assessment:
