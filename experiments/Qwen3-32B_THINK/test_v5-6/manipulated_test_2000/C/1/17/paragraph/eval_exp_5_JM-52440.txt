Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The story is a mix of different narrative segments and a theological discussion. 

First, I'll check for coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logical connections and clear structure. The story has several chapters, including "INTRODUCTION" and "CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE," which are more like essays on theological topics. Then there are narrative parts about characters like Jasper, Sapsea, Durdles, and George Stransom. These sections don't seem to connect logically. For example, the theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine doesn't relate to the narrative parts about the characters and the ghost story. There's a sudden shift from a theological essay to a ghost story with Washington and the blood stain. This lack of connection makes the overall narrative disjointed and confusing. The structure is unclear, and the transitions between the different sections are abrupt. There's no clear progression or unifying theme that ties the different parts together.

Next, fluency. Fluency refers to the smoothness of the language, grammar, and sentence structure. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and syntax. However, there are some instances where the sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the theological sections have long, dense paragraphs that could be challenging to follow. There's also some repetition in the arguments presented, which might make the text feel redundant. The narrative parts, like the one involving George Stransom, are written in a more literary style, which is fluent but could be more concise. Overall, the text is grammatically correct, but the complexity and length of some sentences might hinder fluency slightly.

Now, considering the evaluation criteria. For coherence, the story has major issues with logical sequencing and structure. The different sections don't connect, leading to a disjointed narrative. This would likely result in a lower score. For fluency, while there are some complex sentences, the text is mostly grammatically correct and well-written, so the fluency score might be higher.

I need to summarize the issues in bullet points under the appropriate labels. For coherence, the main issues are [STRUCTURE] and [LOGIC]. For fluency, the main issues are [SYNTAX] and [LEXICON] due to the complex sentences and some redundancy.

After listing the issues, I'll assign the final scores. Coherence is problematic, so maybe a 2. Fluency is better, so maybe a 4. I'll check the accuracy scales to make sure. For coherence, a score of 2 means many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the context is understandable with effort. For fluency, a 4 indicates only minor non-fluent parts. That fits the assessment.

-> 1) Issues: [STRUCTURE] The text is a disjointed collection of unrelated narrative fragments and theological essays with no logical progression or unifying theme. [LOGIC] Sudden shifts between characters (e.g., Jasper/Sapsea, Washington, George Stransom) and topics (ghost story, Church of England doctrine) create abrupt disconnections. [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic/complex theological terminology ("real objective presence," "κοινωνία") disrupts narrative flow. [SYNTAX] Long, dense theological paragraphs with convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "the act of consecration the bread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be bread and wine...") hinder readability. [TRANSITION] No clear transitions between chapters or narrative segments.  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
