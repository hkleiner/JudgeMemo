Alright, let's start by reading through the entire text carefully to understand its content and structure. The story is divided into two chapters: an introduction and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The introduction discusses the impact of Will Bradley on American graphic arts, while the second chapter details his early life and career in printing.

Now, I need to evaluate the text based on the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency.

### Coherence
Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. I'll look for logical sequencing, smooth transitions between ideas, and how well the narrative builds from one section to another.

Issues I notice:
- [LOGIC] The introduction starts with a discussion of Will Bradley but then shifts to an analysis of Dickens's last plot, which seems disconnected from the rest of the text about Bradley.
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly transitions from the introduction about Bradley to a completely different narrative about Stransom and Mary Antrim, which appears to be a different story or character altogether.
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Mr. William Archer" and his role in proofreading is confusingly placed in the middle of the introduction about Bradley.
- [LOGIC] The second chapter about Bradley's early life is well-structured, but the overall structure of the text is confusing due to the sudden shift in narrative and character.
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the different sections, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.

### Fluency
Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, and punctuation.

Issues I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] There are several instances of missing commas or other punctuation that could improve readability.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex or run-on, making them difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] There are some word choices that seem slightly off or not quite natural in the context.
- [SPELLING] I don't notice any actual spelling errors, but there are some formatting issues with punctuation and capitalization.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences are missing necessary punctuation, and there are some questionable uses of dashes and ellipses.

Let me now rate the text according to the provided scales:

### Coherence Score
The text has major issues with coherence. The introduction starts with one topic (Will Bradley's impact on graphic arts), then shifts to an analysis of Dickens's plot, then to a completely different narrative about Stransom and Mary Antrim, and finally returns to Bradley's early life. These abrupt shifts and disconnected sections make it difficult to follow the overall narrative.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Entirely coherent
- Score 4: Some minor disconnected parts
- Score 3: Coherent in general with some obvious abrupt shifts
- Score 2: Many disconnected parts but overall context could be understood
- Score 1: Not coherent at all

I would rate this as a 2 - there are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understood with some effort.

### Fluency Score
The text has some fluency issues, but it's generally readable. There are some awkward phrasings and punctuation issues, but the language is mostly clear and the ideas are conveyed.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Entirely fluent
- Score 4: Only containing some minor non-fluent parts
- Score 3: Fluent in general with some obvious grammatical errors
- Score 2: Major grammatical errors and syntactic issues
- Score 1: Not fluent at all

I would rate this as a 3 - it's fluent in general but has some obvious grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that hinders the flow.

Now, let me summarize my findings in the requested format.

-> 1) Issues: [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Will Bradley's introduction to an unrelated narrative about Stransom and Mary Antrim; [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different sections and narratives; [CLARITY] Confusing placement of Mr. William Archer's proofreading role in the middle of the introduction; [LOGIC] Disconnected sections that don't clearly relate to each other; [TRANSITION] No clear transitions between the different narrative segments; [GRAMMAR] Missing commas and other punctuation that could improve readability; [SYNTAX] Some overly complex or run-on sentences; [LEXICON] Some word choices that seem slightly off or unnatural in context.

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
