Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story text based on Coherence and Fluency using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the entire text carefully.

Starting with Fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. The text is quite dense with literary analysis and references. There are some complex sentences. For example, "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" The use of all caps for "FORSTER" might be a typo, but maybe it's intentional as a name. The italics and quotation marks are used, which is okay. The sentence structure is a bit long, but not necessarily incorrect. 

Looking for spelling errors: I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "picaresque" and "gamin" are correctly spelled. The syntax is complex but seems correct. There are some run-on sentences, but they're common in academic writing. For example, "But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of “hab nab at a venture.”" This is a long sentence but grammatically correct. 

Now, Coherence. The text is an analysis of Dickens's plot structure in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The introduction sets up the thesis about construction in Dickens's later works. The structure moves from general discussion to specific characters and plot points. However, the transition from the introduction to the analysis of the story is abrupt. The "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" section is presented without much context, which might confuse some readers. The flow from discussing characters to the opening of the tale is okay, but some parts feel fragmented, especially when jumping between different elements of the story and theories by other critics. 

The text does provide a clear progression in discussing characters and their relationships, but some sections might be too dense or lack smooth transitions. For example, the sudden shift to "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" without a clear link to the previous section could disrupt the flow. Also, the evaluation of different characters and theories is thorough but might be overwhelming for a less familiar reader. 

Potential issues for Fluency: The use of italics and quotation marks for book titles and terms is consistent, which is good. However, the text has some archaic or formal language that might be less common, like "hab nab at a venture" or "roman policier," but that's part of the style. No obvious spelling or grammatical errors. 

Coherence issues: The structure is mostly logical, moving from introduction to character analysis to plot discussion. However, some sections feel disconnected. The mention of other critics (Proctor, Walters) is integrated into the analysis but could be smoother. The transition from the introduction to the "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" is abrupt. Also, the conclusion is brief and doesn't tie all the points together effectively. 

So, for Fluency, I'd say there are some minor issues with long sentences and complex syntax, but overall it's well-written. Maybe a 4 or 5. For Coherence, the structure is mostly logical but has some abrupt transitions and could be more smoothly connected. A 4 or 3? The text is organized but some parts are a bit disjointed. 

Wait, the evaluation criteria for Coherence score 3: "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text." The transitions between sections like the introduction and the character list are abrupt. Also, the analysis of different theories is present but not always clearly connected. So maybe a 3. For Fluency, since there are no major errors, just some long sentences, it's a 4 or 5. The text is mostly fluent, with minor non-fluent parts. I'll go with 4 for Fluency and 3 for Coherence.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (occasional awkward phrasing in complex sentences), [STRUCTURE] (abrupt transitions between sections like "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" and plot analysis), [CLARITY] (some dense academic language may confuse readers unfamiliar with literary criticism), [TRANSITION] (sudden shifts between character descriptions and critical analysis), [SYNTAX] (overly long sentences in sections like the introduction)  
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions:
