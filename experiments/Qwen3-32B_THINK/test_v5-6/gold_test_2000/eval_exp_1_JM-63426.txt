Okay, let's start by reading through the user's query and the provided story. The task is to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to understand the evaluation criteria. Fluency is about how smooth and error-free the text is in terms of grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. Coherence is about the overall structure, logical flow, and how well the ideas connect.

Looking at the story, it's a two-chapter introduction and a chapter about Will Bradley's early life. The first part is an introduction by someone else, then a detailed narrative of Bradley's childhood and early career. 

For Fluency, I'll check for any obvious grammar issues, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or incorrect punctuation. The story is quite long, but from a quick scan, I notice some potential issues. For example, in the first chapter, the sentence "the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man who romped like a breeze through American graphic arts for several decades--and I feel that my part should be little more than the opening of a door to this perennial springtime freshness." The em dash here might be a bit jarring. Also, in the second chapter, there are some run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "You are now on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston." The quotation marks might be incorrect. There's also a part with "(?) with one stove." The question mark here seems out of place, possibly a typo. 

In terms of coherence, the story transitions between the introduction and the narrative of Bradley's life. The first chapter sets the context of Bradley's impact, then the second chapter dives into his early life. The flow between these chapters is logical. However, there might be some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from the introduction to the childhood narrative is smooth, but within the childhood chapter, there are many events described in quick succession. The timeline is clear, but the dense narrative might make it a bit overwhelming. Also, the mention of historical events and people (like Morris, Beardsley, etc.) might require some background knowledge, which could affect clarity for some readers. 

Now, looking at the issues:

Fluency issues could include:
- [PUNCTUATION]: Use of em dashes and parentheses that might disrupt the flow.
- [GRAMMAR]: Missing commas in run-on sentences.
- [SPELLING]: Possible incorrect quotation marks or other typographical errors.
- [LEXICON]: Some word choices might be awkward or unclear, like "pi" instead of "type" or "font".

Coherence issues might involve:
- [STRUCTURE]: The transition between the two chapters and the dense narrative in the second chapter could be confusing.
- [LOGIC]: The connection between the introduction and the detailed narrative might not be immediately clear to all readers.
- [CLARITY]: Some references to historical figures and events might be too obscure for general readers.

For the scores:
- Fluency: There are some punctuation and grammar issues, but the overall text is mostly fluent. I might rate it a 4 because the errors are minor and don't hinder understanding.
- Coherence: The story is well-structured and logically progresses, but the dense narrative in the second chapter might cause minor confusion. I'd also give it a 4.

I should make sure to list each issue with the appropriate label and then assign the scores. Also, check if there are any other potential issues I might have missed, like repetition or missing transitions. The story is quite detailed, so ensuring that the evaluation covers both chapters is important.

-> 1) Issues:  
[SYNTAX] Overuse of em dashes and parentheses disrupts sentence flow (e.g., "decades--and I feel...").  
[GRAMMAR] Missing commas in run-on sentences (e.g., "You are now on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston").  
[PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent quotation marks and misplaced punctuation (e.g., "pi" likely should be "type").  
[CLARITY] Ambiguous references to historical figures/events without context (e.g., "Kelmscott House").  
[LOGIC] Sudden shifts between narrative and analysis in the introduction chapter.  
[STRUCTURE] Dense chronological narrative in the second chapter lacks clear transitions between events.
