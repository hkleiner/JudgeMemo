Okay, let's start by reading through the given story to understand what it's about. The story is about a person claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest, specifically around the Mississippi River. The author uses a lot of biblical references and geographical descriptions to support their claim. 

Now, I need to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency. 

Starting with Coherence. The story is quite long and detailed, which might help with coherence, but I need to check if the ideas are logically connected and if the narrative flows smoothly. The author starts by explaining their discovery and the process of publishing it. Then they delve into biblical interpretations and geographical details. However, there are several points where the flow seems abrupt. For example, the author jumps between different topics like the location of the Garden of Eden, the characteristics of the area, and even some historical anecdotes about settlers. There are also parts where the author brings in unrelated subjects, like the presence of rattlesnakes or the geological age of the region, which might not directly support the main argument. The structure is a bit meandering, with many digressions. The conclusion is a call to action for others to visit the site, but the overall narrative doesn't have a clear progression. There are also some inconsistencies, like the author mentioning a book by Moritz Engel and then discussing geological samples, which aren't well integrated into the main argument. So, while there are some logical sections, the overall coherence is affected by these jumps and the lack of a clear structure.

Now, Fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The story has several issues here. There are misspellings like "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "scientest" (should be "scientist"), "euphony" (should be "euphonious"), "beatiful" (should be "beautiful"), "jageed" (should be "jagged"), "beatiful" (again), "conceivable" (should be "conceivable" is correct, but "conceivable" is misspelled in the text as "conceivable" but maybe it's a typo). There are also some syntax issues where sentences are run-on or have awkward phrasing. For example, "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." This sentence is a bit convoluted. There are also instances where the author uses commas incorrectly, leading to comma splices. Additionally, some word choices are unclear or non-standard, like "antdeluvians" and "mound-builders." The punctuation is sometimes inconsistent, with missing commas or periods. These issues would affect the fluency of the text, making it harder to read smoothly.

Putting this all together, for Coherence, while the story has a central theme, the structure is disjointed with many digressions and abrupt shifts, leading to a lower score. For Fluency, the numerous spelling and grammatical errors, along with awkward phrasing, would also lower the score. The author's passion and detailed descriptions are there, but the execution in terms of coherence and fluency needs improvement.

-> 1) Issues: [COHERENCE]  
- Abrupt shifts between biblical interpretations, geological descriptions, and anecdotal details (e.g., rattlesnakes, settlers’ stories) without clear transitions.  
- Repetitive claims about the Garden of Eden’s location and characteristics without resolving contradictions (e.g., comparing to Palestine vs. modern Midwest).  
- Disconnected digressions (e.g., geological samples, historical figures like Decora’s Peak) that lack integration into the main argument.  
- Lack of clear progression; the narrative meanders between geographical descriptions, theological assertions, and unrelated historical references.  
- Inconsistent focus on the central thesis (e.g., sudden shifts to dairy farming, geological age debates).  

[FLUENCY]  
- Frequent spelling errors: *antldiluvians*, *admirirg*, *dimentions*, *scientest*, *jageed*, *beatiful*.  
- Awkward syntax and run-on sentences (e.g., long, unpunctuated clauses with missing commas).  
- Non-standard word choices (*antdeluvians*, *mound-builders*) and archaic phrasing (*"Heald’s quarry"*, *"Lo here"*).  
- Inconsistent punctuation (missing periods, comma splices, hyphenation errors).  
- Misused terms (*"euphony"* vs. *"euphonious"*) and unclear phrasing (*"the finger of time"*).  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2  
-> 4) Questions:  
- Are the repeated references to "antediluvians" and "mound-builders" necessary for coherence, or do they fragment the narrative?  
- Could the text benefit from stricter editing to address spelling/grammar errors and syntactic clarity?
