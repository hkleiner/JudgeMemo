I'll analyze the provided story according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand the story. It's a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer, written in a first-person narrative style that shifts between past and present. The story is structured in chapters, starting with an introduction, followed by various chapters detailing different periods in Bradley's life and career.

Now, let me evaluate for fluency and coherence:

For fluency, I need to look at:
- Grammar
- Spelling
- Syntax
- Word choice
- Phrasing
- Punctuation

For coherence, I need to look at:
- Logical sequence
- Non-repetitive ideas
- Smooth connections between ideas
- Clear progression
- Avoidance of ambiguities
- Narrative consistency

Let me now identify issues in the text:

**Fluency Issues:**

[GRAMMAR] - There are some grammatical errors. For example: "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."

[GRAMMAR] - "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." This sentence is awkwardly constructed.

[GRAMMAR] - "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." This sentence is awkwardly structured.
