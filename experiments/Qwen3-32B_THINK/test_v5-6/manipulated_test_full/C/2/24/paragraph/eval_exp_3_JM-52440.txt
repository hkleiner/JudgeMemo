Alright, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency, using the provided criteria. The story is a theological text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. 

First, I'll look at Coherence. The text is structured into chapters and sections, which is good. However, I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced and smoothly connected. The text jumps from one theological point to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Articles, there's a sentence about a drone swarm aligning in formation, which seems out of place. These random insertions disrupt the flow and make the narrative disjointed. Also, the story has a clear thesis and structure, but the interruptions break the coherence.

Next, Fluency. I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and punctuation. The main text is well-written with complex sentences that are grammatically correct. However, there are some instances where the syntax is overly complex, making it hard to follow. The random inserted sentences (like "A keyboard clicked without being touched") are grammatically correct but don't contribute to the story's flow. These insertions might be considered as non-fluent parts since they don't fit the context.

Now, I need to categorize the issues. The main coherence issues are the abrupt shifts and disjointed sections due to the random sentences. For fluency, the complex syntax in some parts and the irrelevant insertions are the main problems. 

For the Coherence score, the text is mostly coherent but has significant disruptions. I'd say a 3 because there are obvious abrupt shifts. For Fluency, there are some minor non-fluent parts but overall the text is well-written, so a 4.

-> 1) Issues:  
[COHERENCE] - Abrupt shifts and disjointed sections due to random inserted sentences (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched," "The energy grid remained balanced").  
[COHERENCE] - Lack of smooth transitions between theological arguments and unrelated technical descriptions.  
[FLUENCY] - Overly complex syntax in some theological explanations (e.g., "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith").  
[FLUENCY] - Minor grammatical inconsistencies in inserted phrases (e.g., "A 3D printer started humming" lacks contextual relevance).  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions:  
None.
