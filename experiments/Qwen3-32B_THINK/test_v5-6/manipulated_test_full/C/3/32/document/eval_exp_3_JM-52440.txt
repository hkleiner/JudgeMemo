Let me analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll identify issues with fluency (syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):
- [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors in the text. For example, "the thing" is used instead of "the Church" in multiple places.
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling errors, though not many. For example, "a stuff" appears multiple times where it should be "the Church".
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is generally complex and formal, which is appropriate for the subject matter, but there are some awkward constructions.
- [LEXICON] The text uses archaic language and religious terminology that might be unfamiliar to some readers, but this is appropriate for the content.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some punctuation issues, such as missing commas and periods in places where they are needed for clarity.

Now, I'll identify issues with coherence (logical sequence, non-repetitiveness, smooth connection of ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities, and consistent structure):
- [LOGIC] The text follows a logical structure with clear sections on different aspects of the doctrine. However, some arguments are repetitive.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with an introduction, multiple chapters, and a conclusion. However, the structure could be more clearly delineated in some places.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are presented clearly, but the complex religious terminology and formal style make it difficult for some readers to follow.
- [TRANSITION] There are some abrupt transitions between sections and ideas, though the overall flow is generally coherent.
- [REPETITION] Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily, which reduces the overall coherence.
- [AMBIGUITY] There are some ambiguous references to "the thing" and "a stuff" that should be "the Church of England".

Let me now assess the scores based on the provided scale:

For fluency:
- The text has several grammatical errors that affect readability.
- There are some spelling errors.
- The syntax is complex but generally correct.
- The word choice is appropriate for the subject matter but sometimes archaic.
- The punctuation has some issues.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 3 - Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text.

For coherence:
- The text has a logical structure but with some repetition.
- The transitions between some sections could be smoother.
- There are some ambiguous references.
- The overall narrative is coherent, but the dense religious terminology and formal style make it challenging to follow at times.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 3 - Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.

Let me summarize my findings:

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (multiple instances of "the thing" instead of "the Church of England", "a stuff" instead of "the Church"), [SPELLING] (some spelling errors), [LOGIC] (some repetitive arguments), [STRUCTURE] (some abrupt transitions), [CLARITY] (complex religious terminology makes it difficult for some readers), [REPETITION] (some ideas repeated unnecessarily)
-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
