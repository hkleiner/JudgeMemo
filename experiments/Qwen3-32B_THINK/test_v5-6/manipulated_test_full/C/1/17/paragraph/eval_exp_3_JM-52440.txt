Alright, let's tackle this task. The user provided a long religious text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. My job is to evaluate the text's coherence and fluency on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, I need to identify issues under the categories of coherence and fluency. Let's start with coherence. The text is structured into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the flow between some parts is abrupt. For example, the transition from discussing the Church of England's doctrine to a question about "The Doctrine of the Real Presence" in the Church of England is unclear. There are also some random sentences that don't connect well with the main topic, like the part about "The American teacher" and "Millet's painting." These seem out of place and disrupt the narrative.

Next, fluency. The text is mostly well-written with correct grammar and syntax. However, there are some awkward phrasings and long sentences that could be broken down for clarity. For instance, the sentence starting with "But if there were any room for doubt..." is quite long and complex. Also, there are a few instances where punctuation is missing or misplaced, which affects readability. The use of certain phrases like "Dr. Warner and all. Take this description in your hand..." feels a bit abrupt and informal, which might not be ideal for a formal text.

Now, considering the evaluation criteria. For coherence, the text has some issues with structure and transitions, but the main argument is clear. The random sentences and shifts in topic are problematic but not overwhelming. I'd rate coherence as a 3 because there are noticeable but not severe issues. For fluency, while there are some minor issues with sentence structure and punctuation, the text is generally readable and grammatically correct. I'd give fluency a 4 since the problems are minor and don't significantly hinder understanding.

I should make sure I didn't miss any other issues. The text is dense with theological content, which might be challenging for some readers, but that's more about content than coherence or fluency. There are also some historical references and quotes that are well-integrated, which is a positive aspect. However, the occasional disjointed sections do affect the overall flow. 

In summary, the main issues are structural and transitional for coherence, and some sentence-level fluency issues. The scores of 3 for coherence and 4 for fluency seem appropriate based on the evaluation criteria provided.

-> 1) Issues:  
[COHERENCE] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., unrelated mentions of "The American teacher" and "Millet's painting" disrupt the theological argument).  
[COHERENCE] Inconsistent transitions between paragraphs (e.g., abrupt shift from doctrinal analysis to a narrative about "Jasper" and "Princess Puffer").  
[COHERENCE] Repetition of key arguments without clear progression (e.g., circular reiteration of the Church of England's stance on transubstantiation).  
[FLUENCY] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "But if there were any room for doubt... it would surely be removed by the next question and answer").  
[FLUENCY] Missing or misplaced punctuation (e.g., incomplete sentences like "3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is stopped.").  
[FLUENCY] Overuse of passive voice and archaic diction (e.g., "It is hereby declared...").
