I'll analyze the story according to the evaluation criterion provided. I need to identify issues with fluency and coherence, then provide scores for both metrics.

Starting with fluency issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] - There are some grammatical issues like missing articles, incorrect prepositions, and subject-verb agreement problems.
2. [PUNCTUATION] - Some sentences have inconsistent or missing punctuation, particularly with quotation marks and commas.
3. [WORD CHOICE] - Some word choices seem awkward or inconsistent with the narrative voice.
4. [STYLE] - The text shifts between different styles and voices at times, particularly in the "Afterword" section.

For coherence issues:

1. [STRUCTURE] - The story is organized in chapters, but some transitions between chapters are abrupt or lack clear connections.
2. [LOGIC] - Some narrative jumps feel disconnected, particularly in the "Chronology" section.
3. [CONSISTENCY] - The narrative voice shifts between first-person and third-person at times, which can be disorienting.
4. [PACING] - Some sections feel rushed while others are overly detailed.

Now I'll rate the text according to the metrics:

For Fluency:
The text is generally well-written and readable, with many elegant passages. However, there are some grammatical issues, occasional awkward phrasing, and some inconsistencies in style. These issues don't severely hinder understanding, but they do occasionally disrupt the flow. I would rate it as a 4 on the fluency scale.

For Coherence:
The story is organized in a chronological way through chapters, which provides a clear structure. However, the narrative sometimes jumps abruptly between different time periods and perspectives. The "Afterword" section is particularly problematic in terms of coherence, as it shifts voices and styles. Despite these issues, the overall narrative remains largely coherent and understandable. I would rate it as a 3 on the coherence scale.

Let me double-check my analysis to ensure I'm not missing any major issues:

The story is a biography of Will Bradley, a designer and printer. It's written in a somewhat literary style with many historical details. The narrative is generally clear, but the shifts in perspective (first-person to third-person) and the inclusion of various historical references can make the story feel disjointed at times.

The "Chronology" section at the end is particularly problematic for coherence, as it's just a list of dates and events with minimal narrative connection between them.

There are also some inconsistencies in the narrative voice and style, particularly in the "Afterword" section, which feels like a different text altogether.

Based on this analysis, I'll provide my final ratings:
</think>

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (Missing articles and prepositions, subject-verb agreement issues) [PUNCTUATION] (Inconsistent or missing punctuation) [WORD CHOICE] (Awkward or inconsistent word choices) [STYLE] (Shifts between different narrative styles) [STRUCTURE] (Abrupt transitions between chapters) [LOGIC] (Disjointed narrative jumps in some sections) [CONSISTENCY] (Inconsistent narrative voice between first-person and third-person) [PACING] (Uneven pacing between sections)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

-> 4) Questions: (optional)
