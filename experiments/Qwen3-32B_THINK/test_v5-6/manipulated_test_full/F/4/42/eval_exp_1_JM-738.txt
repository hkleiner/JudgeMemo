I'll analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand what the text is about. It appears to be a scholarly analysis of the plot of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," discussing various theories about the story's unresolved mysteries.

Now, I'll evaluate the text for fluency and coherence.

For fluency, I'll look for:
- Grammar and syntax errors
- Spelling mistakes
- Word choice and phrasing issues
- Punctuation problems

For coherence, I'll assess:
- Logical flow and sequencing
- Consistency and organization
- Clear progression of ideas
- Avoidance of abrupt jumps or disconnected parts
- Overall narrative structure

Let me analyze the text for these issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [GRAMMAR] "coulded compensate" - incorrect verb form
2. [GRAMMAR] "he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'" - missing punctuation and awkward phrasing
3. [GRAMMAR] "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason;" - awkward phrasing
4. [GRAMMAR] "We may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life." - awkward phrasing
5. [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before." - missing punctuation
6. [GRAMMAR] "He might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires." - incorrect verb form
7. [GRAMMAR] "in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction." - awkward phrasing
8. [GRAMMAR] "he was to had been a victim to the habit of opium smoking." - incorrect verb form
9. [GRAMMAR] "which he was to handed over to Edwin Drood" - incorrect verb form
10. [GRAMMAR] "Grewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin" - missing article
11. [GRAMMAR] "He was conductor of the Choir of the Cathedral" - missing article
12. [GRAMMAR] "He is very dark, with thick black whiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of opium smoking." - awkward phrasing
13. [GRAMMAR] "She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on uncomfortable terms" - awkward phrasing
14. [GRAMMAR] "The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium." - awkward phrasing
15. [GRAMMAR] "He pronounces it 'unintelligible,' which satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must was unintelligible also." - incorrect verb form
16. [GRAMMAR] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" - awkward phrasing
17. [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." - awkward phrasing
18. [GRAMMAR] "He admits that he 'has am taking opium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.'" - incorrect verb form
19. [GRAMMAR] "He has met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." - awkward phrasing
20. [GRAMMAR] "He has two other large keys." - unclear reference

There are numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and incorrect verb forms throughout the text.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text is very dense and academic, making it difficult to follow the logical flow for casual readers.
2. [CLARITY] Some sections are overly complex and could benefit from clearer organization.
3. [LOGIC] The text jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions.
4. [STRUCTURE] The use of long, complex sentences makes it difficult to track the argument.
5. [LOGIC] Some sections are repetitive, discussing the same points from multiple angles.
6. [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different characters and plot points without sufficient context.
7. [CLARITY] The academic tone makes it difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with literary analysis.
8. [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient evidence or explanation.
9. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear sectioning that would help readers follow the complex analysis.
10. [LOGIC] Some conclusions are drawn without sufficient supporting evidence.
11. [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and would benefit from more paragraph breaks and subheadings.
12. [CLARITY] Some literary references and allusions may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with Dickens' work.
13. [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents multiple theories without clearly distinguishing between them.
14. [STRUCTURE] The organization is somewhat chaotic, jumping between different aspects of the story without clear progression.
15. [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented as definitive when they are clearly speculative.

The text is coherent in that it follows a logical progression of discussing different theories about the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." However, the dense academic style and complex structure make it difficult to follow for many readers.

Based on my analysis, I would rate the fluency as 2 (major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments) and the coherence as 3 (coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text).
