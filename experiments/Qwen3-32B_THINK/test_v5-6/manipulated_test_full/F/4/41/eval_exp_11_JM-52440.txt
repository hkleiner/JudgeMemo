Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a long theological text and wants me to evaluate its coherence and fluency according to specific criteria. First, I need to understand the evaluation metrics. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logical progression and clear structure. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, and other language issues in individual sentences.

Looking at the story, it's a detailed theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Eucharist. The structure is clear with chapters and sections, but the content is dense and complex. 

Starting with fluency: I notice some spelling errors, like "Taughtvby" instead of "Taught by", "vlindly" for "blindly", "experiejced" for "experienced". There are also missing or incorrect punctuation, like missing commas and periods. Syntax issues include run-on sentences and awkward phrasing. For example, "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt;" is a long, complex sentence that's hard to follow. Also, some words are repeated or misused, like "ans" instead of "and".

For coherence: The text is structured logically with an introduction, chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice, and a conclusion. However, the arguments are very detailed and might be confusing for a reader unfamiliar with the topic. The flow within each section is logical, but the transitions between sections could be smoother. Some parts jump from one point to another without clear connections. Also, the text uses technical theological terms without explanation, which might make it less accessible. The repetition of certain points and the extensive use of scriptural references might make the argument feel convoluted at times.

Now, applying the scoring scales. For fluency, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors, some awkward syntax, and punctuation issues. These issues are significant but not so severe that they prevent understanding. So maybe a 3? But wait, the fluency scale for 3 says "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." The text has many errors, but the overall message is still understandable. So 3 is possible. However, if the errors are more frequent and severe, maybe a 2. But since the content is still clear despite the errors, I'll go with 3.

For coherence, the structure is good, with clear sections and logical progression within each chapter. However, the complexity of the subject and dense writing might make it hard to follow for some. There are some abrupt shifts and the argument could be more clearly connected. But overall, it's coherent. The coherence scale for 4 says "Only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence." Given that the structure is clear and the main argument holds, maybe a 4. But if the transitions are sometimes abrupt, maybe a 3. However, the main points are well-organized, so I'll lean towards 4.

Wait, the coherence score 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved." If the text has some unclear parts due to dense argumentation but remains coherent, maybe 3. But the structure is there. Hmm. I think the coherence is better than 3. So 4.

Now, summarizing the issues with labels. Fluency issues include spelling, grammar, syntax, punctuation. Coherence issues might include structure and transitions, but the structure is okay. So maybe coherence issues are minor, like some abrupt transitions but not major. 

So, final answer would list the fluency issues with their labels and assign scores accordingly.

-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple grammatical errors (e.g., "Taughtvby," "ans," "experiejced," "vindly," "blessed Saviour").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward or overly complex sentence structures (e.g., long, run-on sentences; fragmented clauses).  
[PUNCTUATION] - Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas, periods, or inconsistent use of quotation marks).  
[LEXICON] - Misused or misspelled words (e.g., "carnally" instead of "carnal," "Hkmself" instead of "Himself").  
[STRUCTURE] - Some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections, particularly in dense theological arguments.  
[CLARITY] - Occasional ambiguity in phrasing (e.g., "He is unworthy of the Lord that otherwise doth celebrate...").  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
The text maintains a clear, logical structure with distinct chapters and sections. Arguments are organized thematically, and the progression of ideas is generally coherent. While some transitions between complex theological points feel abrupt, the overall narrative remains focused and structured.  

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
The text is readable but marred by frequent grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward syntax. These issues occasionally disrupt the flow, though the meaning remains largely understandable due to the clarity of the subject matter and context.  

-> 4) Questions:  
None.
