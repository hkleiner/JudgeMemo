Okay, let's start by reading through the user's query carefully. They want me to evaluate a story based on fluency and coherence using the provided criteria. The story is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. 

First, I need to identify the issues related to fluency and coherence. For fluency, I should look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation errors. For coherence, I need to check if the story is logically structured, with smooth transitions and a clear narrative.

Looking at the story, I notice some spelling mistakes like "biught" instead of "bought," "sne" instead of "she," and "emiled" instead of "smiled." There are also typos such as "Lirtle" instead of "Little" and "witu" instead of "with." These are spelling errors. 

In terms of grammar, there are incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "the purchase was concluded" might be correct, but "has been slilt" should be "has been spilt." Also, some sentences have awkward phrasing or missing words, like "I don't at all care for blood-stains in a sitting-room. It must be removed at once." The transition here is abrupt.

For coherence, the story is a well-known tale, so the structure should be logical. However, some parts might be confusing. The sequence of events is mostly clear, but there are instances where the flow isn't smooth. For example, the ghost's interactions with the family are consistent, but some descriptions are a bit disjointed, possibly due to the original text's style. The narrative does progress logically, but the humor and dialogue might sometimes disrupt the flow.

I should also check for repetition and clarity. The story mentions the blood-stain multiple times, which is intentional for the plot, but the way it's described each time needs to be consistent. There are some instances where the same event is recounted with slight variations, which could be a minor issue in coherence.

Now, assigning the scores. For fluency, the story has several spelling and grammar errors, but they don't severely hinder understanding. The overall fluency is good, so maybe a 4. For coherence, the story is well-structured with a clear narrative, but the minor issues in transitions and some awkward phrasing might bring it down to a 4 as well. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other issues. Let me scan through the text again. There are some missing words like "the" in "theh have notbenough decent weather" and incorrect word choices like "sne" instead of "she." These are spelling and word choice errors. Also, "thrse" instead of "those" and "hrr" instead of "her." These are minor but add up.

Overall, the story is coherent and flows well despite the errors. The main issues are in fluency, so the scores would be 4 for both. I should list the specific issues under their respective categories and then provide the scores.
