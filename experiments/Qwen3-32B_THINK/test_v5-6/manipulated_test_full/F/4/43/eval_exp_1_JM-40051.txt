Okay, I need to evaluate this story for coherence and fluency. Let me start by reading through it carefully. The story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River area. 

First, looking at fluency. There are a lot of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. For example, the first paragraph has a sentence that starts with "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The phrase "first know you are right, then go ahead" is a bit unclear, but the main issue here is the structure. There are several instances of run-on sentences and missing commas. Also, there are words like "admirirg" instead of "admirirg" which should be "admiring". Other parts have missing words or incorrect word order, like "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." It's hard to follow.

Next, coherence. The story jumps around a lot. The author starts by talking about their discovery, then goes into religious references, geographical descriptions, and then back to the Bible. The flow is not smooth. The author mentions locations and features without clearly connecting them to the main idea of the Garden of Eden. There are also some abrupt shifts in topic, like suddenly discussing mounds and geological features without a clear transition. The argument is not well-structured; the author presents various points but doesn't tie them together logically to support the main thesis. Additionally, some parts are repetitive, like repeatedly emphasizing the Mississippi River as the Euphrates without sufficient explanation.

For fluency, the text has numerous errors that make reading difficult. For coherence, the story lacks a clear structure and logical progression. The author's main point is there, but the way it's presented is confusing and disjointed. I need to list the issues under their respective categories and then assign scores based on the given scales.

-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors (e.g., "admirirg" instead of "admiring," missing articles, incorrect verb tenses).  
[SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and awkward phrasing (e.g., "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it").  
[SPELLING] Spelling mistakes (e.g., "antldiluvians," "jageed," "beautifull," "euphonyous").  
[LOGIC] Illogical connections between ideas (e.g., abrupt shifts from geological descriptions to biblical interpretations without clear transitions).  
[STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization; the narrative jumps between locations, religious claims, and scientific arguments without cohesive flow.  
[CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear statements (e.g., "the river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark...").  
[REPETITION] Redundant claims about the Mississippi River as the Euphrates.  
[TRANSITION] Missing transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., sudden shifts from describing valleys to discussing mounds and their builders).  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
The text is largely incoherent, with disconnected ideas, abrupt shifts, and unclear connections between the authorâ€™s claims and evidence. While the central thesis (Mississippi as Eden) is present, the lack of logical progression and structural organization hinders comprehension.  

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2  
The text contains major grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and syntactic issues that disrupt readability. Awkward phrasing and missing components (e.g., missing subjects, incorrect word order) make the prose difficult to follow.  

-> 4) Questions:  
None.
