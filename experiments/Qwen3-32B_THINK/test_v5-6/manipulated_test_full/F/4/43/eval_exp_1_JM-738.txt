I'll carefully analyze the text and evaluate it according to the given criteria.

First, let me read through the text to understand it and identify potential issues with fluency and coherence.

The text appears to be an analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It includes an introduction, the story itself, and various theories about the mystery in the novel. The writing is generally formal and academic in tone.

Let me now identify specific issues with fluency and coherence:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, such as incorrect subject-verb agreement and misplaced modifiers.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the meaning.
3. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, such as "Billickin" instead of "Billickin" (possibly intentional), "gamin" instead of "gamin" (possibly intentional).
4. [LEXICON] Some word choices are questionable or inconsistent, such as using "babblings, half revealed, concealed Jasper one points" which appears to be a jumbled phrase.
5. [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation, including missing commas and periods, and incorrect use of quotation marks.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text has an overall structure, but some sections are disjointed or lack clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] Some arguments and connections between ideas are not clearly made or are confusing.
3. [CLARITY] Certain passages are difficult to understand due to complex sentence structures and unclear phrasing.
4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt or missing.
5. [CONSISTENCY] There are inconsistencies in the presentation of information, particularly in the story section where the narrative becomes jumbled at times.

Now I'll rate the text according to the evaluation criteria:

For fluency:
- The text has many grammatical errors, awkward syntax, and some spelling issues.
- The writing is generally formal but often difficult to follow due to complex sentence structures.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the fluency scale - there are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

For coherence:
- The text has an overall structure but many sections are disjointed.
- The narrative in the "THE STORY" section is particularly problematic with confusing sentence structures and missing transitions.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the coherence scale - there are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.

Let me finalize my ratings and list the issues more specifically.

-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (Subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect pronoun usage), [SYNTAX] (Awkward and convoluted sentence structures), [SPELLING] (Various misspellings), [LOGIC] (Inconsistent or unclear arguments), [STRUCTURE] (Disjointed sections with poor organization), [CLARITY] (Difficult to understand due to complex phrasing), [TRANSITION] (Abrupt or missing transitions between ideas)

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2
