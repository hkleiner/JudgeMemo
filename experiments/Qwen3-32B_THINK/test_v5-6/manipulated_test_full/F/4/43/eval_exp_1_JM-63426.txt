I need to evaluate the given text for both coherence and fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. Let me analyze the text carefully:

First, I'll look at coherence, which assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitiveness, smooth connections, clarity, and consistency in the narrative.

Issues with Coherence:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure with multiple chapters that jump around in time and space without clear transitions. The narrative lacks a consistent chronological flow.
2. [LOGIC] The narrative often jumps between different time periods without clear indication, making it difficult to follow the progression of events in Will Bradley's life.
3. [CLARITY] Some sections are unclear or ambiguous, particularly in the middle chapters where the narrative becomes disjointed.
4. [TRANSITION] There are few transitions between chapters or even within chapters, making the flow between ideas and events abrupt.
5. [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice shifts between first-person and third-person without clear explanation or context.
6. [ORGANIZATION] The text is not well-organized, with some events repeated in different chapters and others appearing out of sequence.

Now for fluency, which assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues with Fluency:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including incorrect verb forms, subject-verb agreement issues, and missing articles.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect, with run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
3. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, such as "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy."
4. [WORD CHOICE] Some word choices are inappropriate or unclear, contributing to confusion.
5. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often incorrect or missing, with some sentences having no punctuation at all.
6. [PHRASING] The phrasing is often awkward or unnatural, making the text difficult to read smoothly.
7. [INCONSISTENT TENSES] The text frequently shifts between past, present, and future tenses without clear reason or explanation.
8. [RUN-ON SENTENCES] There are many run-on sentences that make the text hard to follow.
9. [INCOMPLETE SENTENCES] The text contains many incomplete or fragmented sentences.
10. [POSSIBLE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS] There appear to be some typographical errors, such as "THE the other--then weeklies" which seems like a formatting issue.

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores:

Coherence Score: The text has significant issues with coherence. While it attempts to tell the story of Will Bradley, the structure is confusing, the narrative jumps around, and the connections between ideas are often unclear. The text is organized in a way that makes it difficult to follow the progression of events in Bradley's life. However, the general narrative is still somewhat discernible, so I'll score it a 2.

Fluency Score: The text has numerous issues with fluency. The grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation problems make the text difficult to read. The frequent shifts in tense and the many run-on and incomplete sentences further reduce the readability. I'll score it a 2 as well.

Let me now write my evaluation in the requested format.
