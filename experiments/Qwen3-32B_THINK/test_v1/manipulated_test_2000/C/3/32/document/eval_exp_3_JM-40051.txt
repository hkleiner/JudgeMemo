Okay, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The title is "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," and it's written in a somewhat archaic or old-fashioned style. The author is claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, particularly near the Mississippi River between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences—grammar, sentence structure, and readability. Looking at the text, I notice some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, "It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" seems like a typo or formatting error. There are also instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, like commas and periods in the wrong places. Words like "antldiluvians" and "antideluvians" might be typos for "antediluvians." The sentence structure is often complex and run-on, making it hard to follow. However, the author does use descriptive language effectively, which helps in some parts. Overall, while there are some well-constructed sentences, the frequent errors and awkward phrasing lower the fluency score.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about how well the text is structured and how the ideas flow together. The story starts with the author's claim about discovering the Garden of Eden and then delves into biblical references, geographical descriptions, and historical context. However, the flow is somewhat disjointed. The author jumps between explaining the location, describing the landscape, and making assertions without clear transitions. There are also repetitive points and a lack of clear organization, which makes it hard to follow the argument. The text seems to meander through different ideas without a strong narrative thread. While the central idea is clear, the supporting details are presented in a confusing manner, reducing the overall coherence.

In terms of fluency, the text has several issues with grammar and sentence structure, but some parts are well-written. Coherence is affected by the lack of clear organization and transitions between ideas. I would rate fluency as a 2 or 3, and coherence as a 2 or 3 as well. The exact scores would depend on the severity of the issues, but both aspects are below average due to the problems mentioned.

The story is written in an archaic, verbose style with frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., "the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT," "antldiluvians"). Sentences are often run-on or poorly punctuated, and some words appear misspelled (e.g., "dimentions" instead of "dimensions"). While the descriptive language is vivid, the fluency suffers from inconsistent syntax and unclear expressions. Coherence is further compromised by disjointed transitions, repetitive assertions, and a lack of logical flow between ideas. The author’s argument for locating Eden in the Mississippi River valley is presented without clear structure or persuasive evidence, making the narrative feel fragmented and meandering.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
