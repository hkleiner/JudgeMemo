Okay, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The title is "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," and it's presented as a discovery of the Garden of Eden in the United States, specifically near the Mississippi River. The author uses biblical references to support this claim.

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentencesâ€”grammar, clarity, and correctness. I notice some issues here. There are run-on sentences, like the first paragraph where the author talks about being slow to publish. There's a lack of punctuation, making it hard to follow. Also, some words are misspelled, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians." There are also some awkward phrases, such as "the voice-activated controls blinked to life," which seems out of place in a text about the Garden of Eden. The author also uses a lot of em dashes and dashes without proper punctuation, which affects readability. The sentences vary in length and structure, which could be okay, but the grammatical errors and awkward phrasing lower the fluency score.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about how well the text is structured and how ideas flow logically. The story starts with the author's claim and then moves into biblical interpretations, geographical descriptions, and even some historical anecdotes. However, the flow is a bit jumbled. The author jumps between different points without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi area, there's a sudden mention of a mobile hotspot and voice-activated controls, which seems like an anachronism or error. The text also has some repetitive ideas and lacks a clear progression of arguments. The conclusion is somewhat abrupt, ending with a sentence that's cut off mid-sentence. The structure is loose, and the connections between ideas are not always clear, which affects coherence.

Overall, the fluency is hindered by grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures. The coherence is affected by the lack of logical flow and some disjointed elements. The text tries to make a strong argument but fails to present it in a clear and organized manner.

The story attempts to argue that the Garden of Eden is located in the American Midwest, using biblical references and geographical descriptions. **Fluency** is compromised by frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions"), run-on sentences, inconsistent punctuation, and awkward phrasing (e.g., "the voice-activated controls blinked to life," which feels anachronistic). **Coherence** suffers from disjointed transitions, abrupt shifts in tone (e.g., from religious argument to anachronistic tech references), and a lack of logical progression. The text meanders between claims, historical anecdotes, and speculative assertions without clear organization, weakening its overall argument.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
