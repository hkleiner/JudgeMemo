Alright, let me start by reading through the provided story carefully. The text is a theological treatise discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite detailed, with chapters, specific arguments, and references to religious texts and doctrines.

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences—whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. The sentences in this text are generally well-structured, with proper grammar and punctuation. The author uses complex sentences, which is appropriate for the subject matter, but they are still clear and do not contain obvious grammatical errors. However, there are a few instances where the flow might be slightly disrupted. For example, the sentences "The voice recognition module powered up." and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb." seem out of place and unrelated to the rest of the theological content. These lines don't contribute to the coherence of the text and might be artifacts or errors. Despite these, the majority of the sentences are fluent.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the overall structure and how well the sentences connect to form a unified and logical whole. The text is organized into chapters and sections, which helps in maintaining a logical flow. The arguments are presented in a methodical manner, with the introduction setting up the problem, followed by a detailed examination of the doctrine. The author transitions smoothly between discussing different aspects like the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. However, the presence of those two out-of-place sentences (about the voice recognition module and autonomous vehicle) breaks the coherence. These lines do not relate to the theological discussion and seem to be inserted by mistake. Additionally, the text is dense and assumes a high level of familiarity with the subject, which might make it less accessible to a general audience. But in terms of internal logic and structure, the text is coherent.

In summary, the text is mostly fluent with only minor disruptions. Coherence is strong except for the unrelated sentences. The scores would reflect these observations, with a slight deduction for the incoherent parts.

The text is a dense theological treatise discussing the Church of England’s doctrine on the Eucharist. **Fluency** is generally high, with complex sentences written in formal, grammatically correct English. However, two out-of-context sentences ("The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb") disrupt the flow and appear to be artifacts or errors. **Coherence** is strong overall, as the argument is logically structured, with clear transitions between sections and a methodical exploration of the topic. The unrelated technical sentences and occasional abrupt shifts in tone (e.g., "The biosensor updated its readout") undermine coherence slightly, but the core content remains well-organized and focused. The text assumes prior knowledge of theological terminology, which may affect accessibility but does not detract from its internal consistency.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
