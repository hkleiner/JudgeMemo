Okay, let's start by reading the given story carefully. It's a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The story is about an American family moving into a haunted house in England.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency looks at individual sentencesâ€”grammar, clarity, and correctness. The text has some complex sentences, but they're generally well-structured. There are a few instances where the flow might be a bit awkward, but overall, the sentences are grammatically correct and easy to follow. For example, the dialogue is well-written and fits naturally. However, there are a couple of odd phrases, like "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A bluetooth signal was detected," which seem out of place and might be typos or errors. These could slightly affect fluency.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about the overall structure and how well the sentences and paragraphs connect to form a unified story. The story has a clear narrative flow, introducing characters and the setting, then moving into the events involving the ghost. Each chapter transitions smoothly, and the events logically follow each other. The dialogue and descriptions help maintain the story's progression. However, the out-of-place tech mentions (hologram, Bluetooth) might disrupt the coherence a bit, as they don't fit the 19th-century setting. Despite that, the main narrative is well-organized and builds up the tension effectively.

Considering fluency, the story is mostly well-written with minor issues. Coherence is strong, though the anachronistic elements could be a slight problem. So, fluency might be a 4, and coherence a 5, but the tech mentions might lower the coherence to a 4.5, which rounds to 4. But I need to check if the user wants to consider those as errors or just part of the text. Since they are in the provided text, maybe they are intentional, but they do break the historical context. So, coherence might be slightly lower. Final scores: Coherence 4, Fluency 4.

The text is a well-structured excerpt from Oscar Wilde's *The Canterville Ghost*. Fluency is generally strong, with grammatically correct sentences and polished dialogue. However, a few anachronistic phrases like "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A bluetooth signal was detected" disrupt the historical tone, suggesting possible errors or stylistic inconsistencies. Coherence is high overall, as the narrative progresses logically, with clear character introductions, setting details, and a rising tension around the ghostly events. The story maintains a cohesive flow, though the jarring tech references slightly undermine immersion. 

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
