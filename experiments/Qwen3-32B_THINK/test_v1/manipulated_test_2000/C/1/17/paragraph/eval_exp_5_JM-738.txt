Alright, let's start by reading the given story carefully. The text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "Edwin Drood," focusing on the construction of the plot and the characters. The writing style is academic and somewhat dense, with references to literary critics like Forster and Proctor, and it delves into the narrative structure of Dickens's work.

Now, let's evaluate the fluency. Fluency measures the quality of individual sentences, including grammar and clarity. The sentences in this text are generally well-structured and grammatically correct. There are some complex sentences with multiple clauses, but they are handled well. There are a few instances of awkward phrasing or punctuation, but overall the sentences are clear and flow naturally. For example, the sentence "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises" is concise and clear. There are a few instances of unusual formatting, like the use of italics and em dashes, but they don't detract from the fluency. I would rate the fluency as a 4, as it's very good but not perfect.

Next, coherence. Coherence measures how well the text is organized as a whole. The text starts with an introduction to Dickens's construction of plots in his later works, then moves into a detailed analysis of "Edwin Drood," including character descriptions and plot elements. The flow is logical, with clear transitions between sections. The author provides background information, then moves into analysis, and finally summarizes key points. However, there are some minor issues with the flow, particularly in the transition from the introduction to the analysis of the characters and the plot. The text jumps from discussing literary criticism to providing a detailed character list and plot summary without a smooth transition. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt, ending with a quote that doesn't directly connect to the preceding analysis. Despite these issues, the overall structure is clear and the content is well-organized. I would rate the coherence as a 3, as it's good but has some minor structural issues that slightly affect the overall flow.

In summary, the text is well-written with clear, grammatically correct sentences (fluency 4), but the organization could be slightly improved with better transitions and a more cohesive conclusion (coherence 3).

The text is academically dense and well-structured, with clear, grammatically correct sentences that demonstrate strong fluency. However, its coherence is slightly diminished by abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., from literary critique to character summaries) and an incomplete narrative arc, as the analysis of "Edwin Drood" ends mid-sentence. The disjointed conclusion further weakens the overall cohesion.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
