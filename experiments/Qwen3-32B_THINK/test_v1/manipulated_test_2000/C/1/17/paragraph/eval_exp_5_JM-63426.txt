Okay, I need to evaluate this story based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

First, fluency. I'll look at each sentence to check if they're well-written and grammatically correct. The story has some complex sentences, especially in the first part. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern..." This part is a bit long but still clear. There are some run-on sentences, like "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." The commas here are a bit heavy, but the meaning is still understandable. I notice a few instances where the punctuation might be off or sentences could be split, but overall, the grammar is mostly correct. There are some typos or missing words? Let me check again. The text seems okay in terms of spelling and grammar. So fluency is decent, maybe a 4.

Now coherence. Coherence is about how the text is structured and how well the ideas flow. The story starts as an introduction to Will Bradley, then jumps to a chapter about his early life. There's a sudden shift from the introduction to a scene with Stransom and Paul Creston in London. Then it goes back to Bradley's childhood. This abrupt transition might confuse the reader. The story's structure is a bit disjointed. The first part talks about Bradley's impact on graphic arts, then there's a scene that seems like a different story, and then back to Bradley's early life. The coherence could be improved by better transitions between sections. However, within each chapter, the ideas are well-organized. For example, the chapter about Ishpeming details Bradley's early career in a logical sequence. But the overall structure lacks smooth transitions between the introduction and the chapters. So coherence might be a 3 or 4. Let me check again. The chapters are separate, and each has its own flow, but the transitions between them are abrupt. The London scene in the middle seems out of place. So maybe a 3 for coherence because the overall structure is a bit confusing even though individual parts are coherent.

In summary, fluency is good with some complex sentences but mostly correct. Coherence is moderate due to structural issues and abrupt transitions between chapters.

The text exhibits strong fluency with mostly grammatically correct and well-structured sentences, though some complex constructions and occasional punctuation issues may slightly hinder readability. Coherence is partially compromised by abrupt transitions between distinct narrative sections (e.g., shifting from an introduction to Will Bradley to a London scene involving Stransom and Paul Creston, then back to Bradleyâ€™s childhood). While individual chapters are internally organized, the overall structure lacks smooth connections, creating a disjointed reading experience.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
