Okay, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The first thing I notice is that the text is split into two chapters: an introduction and a story about Will Bradley's early life. The language is quite formal and detailed, with a lot of historical and biographical information.

Looking at fluency first. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentences, so I need to check for grammatical correctness, sentence structure, and readability. There are some typos and misspellings, like "seem" instead of "seen," "toom" instead of "room," "wre" instead of "were," "cmsitting" instead of "sitting," and "rethrn" instead of "return." These errors make some sentences hard to read. Also, there are some awkward phrases and missing punctuation. For example, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The sentence structure here is a bit clunky. Additionally, some sentences run on without proper breaks, which can affect fluency. However, despite these issues, the sentences are generally clear and the overall message is understandable. So I'd say the fluency is moderate, maybe a 3 out of 5.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about how well the sentences flow together and how the text is organized. The story moves from the introduction of Will Bradley's impact on graphic arts to his early life as a printer. The chapters are distinct, and the narrative transitions between the introduction and the biographical chapter. The flow within each chapter is logical, with a chronological progression in the second chapter. However, there are some abrupt shifts in the second chapter, like moving from the introduction of the boy printer to specific events without clear transitions. Also, some paragraphs are quite long and could be broken up for better readability. The overall structure is okay, but the typos and some disjointed sentences do affect the coherence. I would rate it a 3 as well, because while the structure is there, the errors and some awkward transitions prevent it from being fully coherent.

In summary, the text has a good amount of content and a clear narrative intent, but the presence of typos, grammatical errors, and some awkward phrasing affects both fluency and coherence. The story is understandable but could be improved with proofreading and better sentence structure.

The story is rich in historical and biographical detail but suffers from frequent spelling errors (e.g., "seem" → "seen," "toom" → "room"), grammatical mistakes (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb forms), and awkward phrasing. These issues disrupt fluency, making some sentences hard to parse. Coherence is partially maintained through chronological storytelling and thematic focus on Bradley’s impact, but abrupt transitions and disjointed paragraphs (e.g., sudden shifts in time or incomplete sentences) weaken the flow. The text’s intent is clear, but its technical flaws hinder readability and structural cohesion.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
