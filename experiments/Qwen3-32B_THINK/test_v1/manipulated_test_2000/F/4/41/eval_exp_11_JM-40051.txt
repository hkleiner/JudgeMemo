Alright, let's start by reading the story carefully. The title is "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden," and it's written in a somewhat archaic or old-fashioned style. The author claims to have discovered the location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest, specifically near the Mississippi River. 

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentences—whether they are grammatically correct and well-written. Looking through the text, I notice several issues. There are spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "princopak" instead of "principal," and "locayion" instead of "location." These errors make the text harder to read and suggest a lack of proofreading. Additionally, some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation, such as "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The sentence structure is sometimes awkward, and the use of archaic language might be intentional but can affect clarity.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the text is structured and how the ideas flow together. The author's main argument is that the Garden of Eden is in the Mississippi River valley, and they provide various reasons and descriptions to support this. However, the text jumps between different points without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the rivers, the author suddenly shifts to talking about rattlesnakes and then to the city of La Crosse. The flow of ideas is not smooth, and some parts seem disjointed. The author also makes several claims without sufficient evidence, which might confuse the reader. The structure is somewhat meandering, which affects the overall coherence.

In terms of fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which would lower the score. For coherence, while the author has a central idea, the lack of logical flow and transitions between ideas makes the text less coherent. I would rate fluency a 2 and coherence a 3, as the text is readable but has significant issues in both areas.

The story is written in an archaic style with frequent spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "princopak," "locayion"), awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation, which hinder fluency. Coherence is further compromised by abrupt shifts in focus, disjointed arguments, and a lack of clear transitions between ideas. The author’s central claim about the Garden of Eden’s location is muddled by tangential details and unsupported assertions, making the narrative feel unfocused. While the text conveys a specific thesis, its structure and execution are disorganized, reducing readability and logical flow.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
