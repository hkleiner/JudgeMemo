Okay, let's start by reading through the story provided. It's an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost," which is a classic ghost story by Oscar Wilde. The story is well-known, so the text here is likely a part of it.

First, I need to evaluate fluency. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences—whether they are grammatically correct and well-written. As I read through, I notice some typos and spelling errors. For example, "seej by several living members" should be "seen by," and "as wdll as bu tye rector" is clearly a typo. There are also instances like "waw sent back" and "finebfreedom." These errors disrupt the flow and make the text less fluent. However, the overall structure of the sentences is mostly correct, and the story is engaging despite these mistakes.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about how well the text is structured as a whole. The story has a clear narrative with a logical progression: the Otis family moves into a haunted house, encounters the ghost, and their interactions. The chapters are distinct but connected. However, the typos and some awkward phrasings (like "the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge") might slightly affect the smoothness of the narrative. The story builds up the ghost's presence effectively, but the errors could make it harder to follow the plot seamlessly.

Now, considering the definitions again. Fluency is about individual sentences. The presence of multiple spelling and grammatical errors would lower the fluency score. Coherence is about the overall structure and flow. While the story is coherent in its plot, the errors might cause some confusion, so the coherence score might also be slightly lower.

I need to rate both aspects on a scale from 1 to 5. For fluency, the numerous errors would likely place it around 3. Coherence might be a bit higher, maybe a 4, because the story's structure is clear despite the errors. However, if the errors significantly disrupt the flow, coherence could be lower. Let me check again. The story does follow a logical sequence, but the errors might make it less coherent. So maybe coherence is a 3 or 4. Fluency is definitely lower due to the errors.

The text is a well-known ghost story with a clear narrative structure, but it contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "seej by," "waw sent back," "finebfreedom") that disrupt fluency. These errors, while not obscuring the plot, reduce the readability of individual sentences. Coherence is maintained through the logical progression of events and character interactions, though some awkward phrasing and inconsistencies (e.g., "a fsw weeks afger") slightly hinder the overall flow. The story’s framework remains intact, but the technical issues affect both fluency and coherence.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
