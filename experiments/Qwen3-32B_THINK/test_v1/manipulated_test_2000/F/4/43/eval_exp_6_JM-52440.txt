Okay, let's start by reading the story carefully. The text is an excerpt from a theological discussion about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite dense and academic, with a lot of references to scripture, church documents, and theological arguments.

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentencesâ€”grammar, clarity, and correctness. The text uses formal language and complex sentence structures. I notice a few places where the sentences are a bit convoluted or have awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This part is very confusing and seems to have grammatical errors. There are also some run-on sentences and instances where punctuation is missing, making it hard to follow. However, much of the text is well-written with correct grammar and clear explanations. So overall, while there are some issues, the majority of the sentences are fluent.

Next, coherence. This is about how well the text is structured and how the ideas flow together. The text starts with an introduction about the importance of examining the Church's teachings, then moves into the doctrine of the Real Presence, followed by a discussion of the Articles of the Church. Each section seems to build on the previous one, and the author presents arguments methodically. However, the middle part with the confusing sentence breaks the flow and makes it harder to follow the argument. The transition between discussing the Articles and the sacraments is logical, but the problematic sentence disrupts the coherence. Despite that, the overall structure is clear, and the main points are presented in a logical order. The conclusion ties back to the introduction, reinforcing the purpose of the text.

So, for fluency, I'd rate it a 3 because of the occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, but most of it is clear. For coherence, a 4 since the structure is logical and the argument flows well, despite one major disruption.

The text is a dense theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Eucharist. **Fluency** is generally high, with formal, grammatically correct sentences and clear explanations of complex ideas. However, one sentence is severely fragmented and incoherent (e.g., "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual."), which disrupts readability. **Coherence** is strong overall, as the text is logically structured, progressing from introduction to doctrinal analysis, with clear arguments and references to theological documents. The disjointed sentence mentioned above slightly weakens the flow, but the broader argument remains organized and purposeful.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
