Alright, let's start by reading through the story to understand what it's about. The author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, specifically near La Crosse and Winona. There's a lot of biblical references and comparisons to the Euphrates and other rivers. The text seems to be a mix of personal narrative, historical analysis, and geographical description.

Now, looking at fluency. The sentences are quite long and often run together without proper punctuation. There are several grammatical errors, like "had venture to published it" instead of "had ventured to publish it," and "was being effaced by the profuse growth of timber" where "is being" would be correct. Subject-verb agreement issues are present, such as "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity" instead of "resulted." These errors make the text hard to read and reduce fluency.

For coherence, the story jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. It starts with the author's discovery, then goes into biblical interpretations, then into geographical descriptions, and ends with a detailed account of the landscape. The connections between these sections aren't always clear, making the overall argument feel disjointed. The author tries to link the Mississippi River to the Euphrates and the Garden of Eden, but the logic is weak and not well-supported. The flow is confusing, and the conclusion about the location doesn't effectively tie back to the initial claims.

In terms of fluency, the numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing would lower the score. For coherence, the lack of clear structure and logical flow would also result in a lower score. The text has potential but needs significant editing to improve clarity and readability.

The story is a mix of speculative historical claims, biblical references, and geographical descriptions. **Fluency** is hindered by frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "had venture to published," "it should was sought"), inconsistent verb tenses, and awkward phrasing (e.g., "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity"). Sentences often run together or lack proper punctuation, disrupting readability. **Coherence** suffers due to disjointed transitions between ideas, unclear logical connections, and repetitive assertions without supporting evidence. The narrative jumps between biblical interpretation, geographic claims, and anecdotal details (e.g., rattlesnakes, town development) without a unifying structure, leaving the argument for the "Garden of Eden" in the Mississippi valley confusing and underdeveloped.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
