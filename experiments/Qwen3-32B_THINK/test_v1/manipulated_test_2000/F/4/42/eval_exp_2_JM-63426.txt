Okay, I'm going to evaluate the quality of this written story based on fluency and coherence. Let me read through it carefully first.

The story is an introduction and a chapter about Will Bradley's life, focusing on his career as a graphic artist and his early experiences as a printer. The text is quite long, with many historical references and descriptions of his work and impact.

For fluency, I need to assess the quality of individual sentences, checking for grammatical correctness and how well-written they are. Looking at the text, I notice some issues:
- There are many grammatical errors like "It shoulded be talked about" instead of "It should be talked about"
- "to was an artist" instead of "to be an artist"
- "you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'" instead of "you were"
- "you went to worked" instead of "you went to work"
- "you are now a worked man" instead of "you are now a worker"
- "he may had had" instead of "he may have had"
- "you are now thirteen and Mr. Newett offers you ten dollars a week and the acknowledged position of job printer" - this is awkward phrasing

There are also some punctuation issues and inconsistent verb tenses. These errors make the text less fluent and harder to read.

For coherence, I need to evaluate how well the text is structured as a whole and how the ideas flow together. The text attempts to tell a story about Will Bradley's life and impact on graphic arts, but there are some issues:
- The structure is somewhat disjointed, jumping between different aspects of Bradley's life and career
- There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs
- The text mixes biographical information with commentary on his work
- Some paragraphs are quite long and could benefit from better organization
- The narrative sometimes gets bogged down in specific details without clear connections

However, there is a clear overall narrative about Bradley's life and career, and the text does attempt to connect different aspects of his life and work. The author is trying to convey Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, which is a coherent theme.

In summary, the text has a clear overall message about Will Bradley's life and impact on graphic arts, which gives it some coherence. However, the numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing significantly impact fluency. The structure could also be improved for better coherence.

Now I'll give my final scores:

For fluency, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The text has many grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and incorrect verb forms that make it difficult to read smoothly.

For coherence, I would rate it a 3 out of 5. While the text has a clear overall narrative about Bradley's life and impact on graphic arts, the structure is somewhat disjointed with abrupt transitions and some paragraphs that could be better organized.

The story is an introduction to Will Bradley, a significant figure in American graphic arts. It has a clear narrative structure that traces his life and impact, but is marred by numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The text attempts to convey Bradley's influence and artistic contributions, but the frequent grammatical mistakes (e.g., "It shoulded be talked about," "you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'") and inconsistent verb tenses disrupt fluency. The coherence is moderate, as the narrative connects different aspects of Bradley's life and work, but the structure is occasionally disjointed with abrupt transitions and some paragraphs lacking clear connections. Despite these issues, the overall theme of Bradley's legacy and pioneering spirit is discernible.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
