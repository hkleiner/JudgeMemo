Okay, let's start by reading through the story provided. The text is a theological discussion about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite dense with religious terminology and arguments, which might affect both fluency and coherence.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentences—whether they're grammatically correct and well-written. Scanning through the text, I notice several grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "teach by the Church" should be "taught by the Church." There are also instances where verb tenses don't match, like "they am the true expositors" instead of "they are." Additionally, some sentences are awkwardly constructed, making them hard to read smoothly. Words like "was" are used incorrectly in past tense contexts. These issues would lower the fluency score.

Next, coherence. Coherence refers to how well the text is structured and how the ideas flow logically. The text is organized into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the argumentation sometimes jumps between points without clear transitions. For instance, the author moves from discussing the Church's teachings to quoting scripture and then to defining sacraments. While there's a general structure, the lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and the dense, repetitive content might make it hard for readers to follow the argument. The text is coherent in that it stays on topic, but the complex structure and occasional logical leaps could hinder overall coherence.

Considering both aspects, the fluency issues are numerous and affect readability, so a lower score there. Coherence is better but still has room for improvement due to structural issues. I'll rate fluency around 2 and coherence around 3.

The text is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine of the Lord’s Supper. **Fluency** is hindered by frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "teach by the Church," "they am the true expositors," "the point was supposed to had been settle"), inconsistent verb tenses, and awkward phrasing (e.g., "we was taught by our Lord Himself," "the elements are in some way or other connect"). These errors disrupt readability. **Coherence** is partially maintained through a structured argument and thematic progression, but the dense, repetitive content and abrupt shifts between scripture, definitions, and theological claims create logical gaps. Transitions between ideas are often unclear, and the conclusion feels disjointed from earlier points.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
