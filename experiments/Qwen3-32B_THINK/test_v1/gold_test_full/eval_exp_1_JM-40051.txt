Okay, let me start by reading through the given story to understand its content and structure. The story is about the author's claim of discovering the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest, specifically near the Mississippi River. The text is quite lengthy and filled with detailed descriptions of the landscape, comparisons to the Bible, and various historical and geographical references.

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences—whether they are grammatically correct and well-written. I'll look for any sentence fragments, run-on sentences, or grammatical errors. For example, the text has some awkward phrases like "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT," which seems like a formatting error. There are also instances where the punctuation is inconsistent, such as missing commas and periods. Additionally, some sentences are very long and complex, which can affect readability. However, the majority of the sentences are complete and grammatically correct. There are some typos, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," but these are relatively minor. Overall, the fluency is decent but has some issues that could be improved.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about how well the text is structured as a whole. The story should have a logical flow, with each paragraph building on the previous one. The author presents their argument in a somewhat meandering way, jumping between different points without clear transitions. The narrative is centered around the author's discovery and the evidence supporting it, but the structure is not very organized. There are numerous digressions, such as descriptions of specific locations, historical references, and comparisons to other theories, which can make it hard to follow the main argument. The conclusion is somewhat abrupt, and the overall structure lacks a clear progression of ideas. Despite these issues, the central idea is present, and the author does attempt to connect various pieces of evidence to support their claim. However, the lack of a clear structure and the frequent shifts in focus reduce the coherence of the text.

In summary, while the text has some grammatical errors and issues with sentence structure that affect fluency, the main problem lies in coherence. The lack of organization and logical flow makes it difficult for the reader to follow the author's argument effectively.

The text is a verbose and meandering argument for locating the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley. **Fluency** is moderately strong, with mostly grammatically correct sentences, though some awkward phrasing, typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions"), and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing commas, fragmented ideas) hinder readability. The writing style is overly ornate, with excessive adjectives and run-on descriptions. **Coherence** is weak: the narrative lacks a clear structure, jumps between geographical details, theological assertions, and tangential anecdotes, making it hard to follow the central argument. The author’s repetitive emphasis on "Come and see!" and disjointed transitions between ideas (e.g., from geological claims to historical figures) further disrupt logical flow. While the core claim is present, the lack of organization and clarity significantly reduces coherence.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
