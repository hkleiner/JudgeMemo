Okay, let's start by reading the story carefully. The text is about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's a detailed theological discussion with chapters and specific arguments.

First, looking at fluency. The sentences are long and complex, with a lot of religious and theological terminology. However, each sentence seems grammatically correct and well-structured. The author uses formal language, which is appropriate for the subject matter. There are no obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would hinder understanding. So, fluency seems good, maybe a 4 or 5.

Now, coherence. The text is organized into chapters and sections, which helps in following the argument. The author presents a clear thesis in the introduction and then systematically addresses different points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each section builds on the previous one, referencing earlier points and maintaining a logical flow. The arguments are supported with references to church documents and scriptures. The transitions between ideas are smooth, and the structure supports the overall argument. Coherence is also strong, maybe a 5.

However, the text is quite dense and might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. But since the question is about quality, not accessibility, the coherence and fluency are both high. So, final scores would likely be 5 for both.

The text is a dense theological treatise with complex sentence structures and formal language. Fluency is high, as sentences are grammatically correct and stylistically consistent, though some phrasing may feel archaic. Coherence is strong, with a logical progression from introduction to specific doctrinal points, supported by structured arguments and references to authoritative documents. The organization ensures clarity in presenting opposing views and the Churchâ€™s stance.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
