Alright, let me start by reading through the given text carefully. The story is an excerpt from a theological discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite dense with religious terminology, references to articles, homilies, and liturgical practices. 

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentencesâ€”whether they are grammatically correct and well-written. I'll look for any obvious grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or run-on sentences. The text is formal and academic, so some complexity is expected. However, there are a few instances where the sentences are convoluted, and some phrases are awkwardly structured. For example, "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." The sentence is long and could be split for clarity, but it's still grammatically correct. There are a few instances where punctuation is missing or misplaced, but overall, the grammar is sound. 

Next, coherence. Coherence is about how well the text is structured and how the ideas flow logically. The text is organized into chapters and sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the doctrine. The author presents arguments, references various documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies), and counters opposing views. The structure is logical, moving from introduction to the Real Presence, then Adoration, and finally Sacrifice. Each section builds on the previous one, and the author uses signposts like "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth" to guide the reader. However, the dense content and frequent shifts between argumentation and theological references might make it challenging for some readers to follow. The flow is generally good, but the complexity of the subject matter and the formal tone may hinder readability for those unfamiliar with the topic.

In terms of fluency, the text is mostly well-written with some minor issues in sentence structure. For coherence, the organization is logical, but the complexity and density of the content may affect the overall flow for some readers. 

Now, considering the instructions, I need to provide a brief explanation of the quality in 100-200 tokens, then assign scores for fluency and coherence from 1 to 5. 

The text is a formal theological discourse with a clear structure, divided into chapters and sections. It references various Church documents and presents arguments in a logical sequence. However, the dense content and complex sentences may affect readability. Fluency is generally good with minor grammatical issues. Coherence is strong due to the logical flow and organization, though the complexity may challenge some readers.

Final scores: Fluency might be a 4, as there are some awkward sentences but overall good grammar. Coherence is a 4 as well, given the logical structure but the high complexity.

The text is a formal, theological discourse with a clear structure divided into chapters and sections, presenting arguments and references to Church documents. It is well-organized, with logical progression from introduction to doctrinal analysis. However, the dense content, complex sentences, and frequent shifts between argumentation and theological references may hinder readability for some. Fluency is generally strong, with minor grammatical awkwardness in a few sentences. Coherence is high due to the logical flow and use of signposts, though the complexity and density of the material may challenge comprehension for less familiar readers.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
