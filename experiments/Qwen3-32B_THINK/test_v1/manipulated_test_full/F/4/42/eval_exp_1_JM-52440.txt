Alright, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want me to evaluate the quality of a written story based on fluency and coherence. The story is a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper.

First, I need to define the two aspects clearly. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentencesâ€”whether they are grammatically correct and well-written. Coherence is about how well the sentences flow together to form a structured and logical whole.

Looking at the text, it's quite long and dense, filled with theological terminology and arguments. I'll start by checking for fluency. I'll read through a few paragraphs to spot any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or run-on sentences. For example, the sentence structure is complex with many subordinate clauses, which might affect fluency. However, the text is generally well-written, with correct grammar and proper use of terms. There are some instances of archaic language, like "was" instead of "were" or "was" instead of "has been," which might be intentional for style but could slightly impact readability for modern readers. However, these are stylistic choices rather than errors.

Next, coherence. The text is structured into chapters and sections, each addressing different aspects of the doctrine. The arguments are presented in a logical order, moving from introduction to specific topics like the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each section builds on the previous one, and the author uses references to church documents to support their points. However, the density of information and the repetitive nature of some arguments might make it challenging to follow for someone not familiar with the subject. The transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth, but the length of the text and the complexity of the arguments could test the coherence for a general reader.

In terms of fluency, the text is mostly fluent, with some minor issues in archaic phrasing. For coherence, the structure is logical, but the density and repetition might affect how well the overall message is conveyed to a broader audience. I'll rate fluency as a 4 and coherence as a 3, considering the complexity and the intended audience's familiarity with theological discourse.

The text is a dense theological treatise with **high fluency** in terms of grammatical correctness and formal structure, though its archaic phrasing ("was" instead of "were," "do was" instead of "do so") and complex sentence structures may challenge modern readers. **Coherence** is strong in its logical progression through doctrinal arguments, but the repetitive emphasis on refuting opposing views and the dense, argumentative style reduce clarity for a general audience. The text is well-organized, but its technical depth and polemical tone make it less accessible.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
