I'll carefully evaluate the story on the two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

First, let me read through the text to understand its content and quality.

The story is a long, detailed account of a person's claim to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley region of the United States. The author presents this as a serious claim, comparing the geographical features of this area with the biblical description of Eden. It's written in a very elaborate, flowery style with many digressions and detailed descriptions of the landscape.

Now let's evaluate the fluency:

Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences - whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. 

Issues with fluency I notice:
- There are numerous grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect prepositions, missing articles, etc.)
- The text is full of run-on sentences and sentence fragments
- The punctuation is often incorrect or inconsistent
- There are many misspellings (e.g., "admirirg", "dimentions", "euphony", "euphonious", "euphony", "jageed", "beatiful", etc.)
- The text has a very archaic, old-fashioned style with many archaic expressions and sentence structures
- There are many instances of incorrect word usage (e.g., "was" used as an auxiliary verb when "were" is needed, "was" used as a verb when "is" is needed)
- The text has an inconsistent tone and register (mixing very formal and very casual language)

Now for coherence:

Coherence refers to the overall structure and logical flow of the text. Does it build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information?

Issues with coherence:
- The text is extremely long and meanders through many topics without clear organization
- It jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions
- There is a lack of clear structure or logical progression
- The author often introduces a point and then never returns to it
- There are many digressions and tangents that don't support the main argument
- The text is repetitive, often repeating the same points multiple times
- The argument is weak and often self-referential
- The author frequently contradicts themselves or presents inconsistent claims
- The text lacks a clear thesis or main point that is consistently developed
- There are many logical fallacies and weak arguments used to support the claim

In summary, this text has significant issues with both fluency and coherence. The writing is full of grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and misspellings. The overall structure is disorganized and lacks logical flow, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.

Now I'll provide a brief explanation of the quality of the text regarding fluency and coherence, followed by the final scores.

The text has significant issues with both fluency and coherence. The fluency is poor, with numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and misspellings throughout. The sentence structure is often unclear, with run-on sentences and incorrect word usage. The coherence is also weak, as the text lacks a clear structure or logical flow. It meanders through many topics without clear organization, jumps from one idea to another, and includes many digressions and tangents. The argument is repetitive, self-referential, and lacks a consistent thesis.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
