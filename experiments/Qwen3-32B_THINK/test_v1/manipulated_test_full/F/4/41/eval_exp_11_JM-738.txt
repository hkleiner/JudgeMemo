Alright, let's tackle this. First, I need to read through the entire story provided. It's a detailed analysis of Dickens's "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," discussing various theories about the plot and characters. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the text.

Starting with fluency: I'll look at sentence structure, grammar, and clarity. The story is written in an academic, analytical style with complex sentences. There are some typos and formatting issues, like "nRosa Bud" and "nrustee," which might affect readability. However, the overall sentences are well-structured and grammatically correct, so fluency should be high.

For coherence: I need to check if the text is logically organized and the ideas flow smoothly. The story is divided into chapters and sections, each focusing on different aspects of the plot and theories. The arguments are presented methodically, comparing different theories and using evidence. However, the dense content and occasional shifts between theories might make it a bit challenging to follow, but the structure is generally coherent.

Now, considering the definitions given: Fluency is about individual sentences being well-written and correct. The text has some minor errors but mostly maintains high fluency. Coherence is about the overall structure and flow. The text is well-organized, though the complexity might affect some readers. 

Final scores: Fluency 4 (some minor issues but mostly well-written), Coherence 4 (well-structured but complex content).

The text is a dense, analytical essay on Dickens’s *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, rich in literary critique and speculative theories. **Fluency** is generally strong, with complex sentences and academic tone, though occasional typos ("nrustee," "nRosa Bud") and inconsistent formatting ("n" prefixes) slightly disrupt readability. Grammar and syntax are mostly correct, preserving clarity. **Coherence** is solid: the structure is logical, with clear chapter divisions and methodical comparisons of theories (e.g., Proctor vs. Walters). However, the text’s academic density, frequent shifts between arguments, and intricate plot summaries may challenge some readers. The central thesis (Edwin’s survival) is consistently argued, but tangential debates and verbose explanations occasionally muddy the flow.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
