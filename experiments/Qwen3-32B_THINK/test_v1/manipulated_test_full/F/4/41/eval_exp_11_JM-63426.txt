Alright, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want me to act as a human annotator evaluating the quality of a given story based on fluency and coherence. The story is quite long, so I need to read through it carefully. 

First, I need to define the two dimensions: fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences, their grammar and correctness. Coherence is about how well the text is structured as a whole, how the sentences and paragraphs connect to form a logical flow.

Looking at the story, it's a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer. The text is divided into chapters, each detailing different periods of his life and career. The language is formal, with a narrative style that includes some historical context and personal anecdotes.

For fluency, I need to check for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or sentences that don't make sense. The story has some typographical errors like "Ine" instead of "In the" and "ghe" instead of "the". There are also instances of inconsistent formatting, like missing quotation marks and incorrect punctuation. These issues might affect fluency. However, despite these errors, the sentences are mostly clear and convey their intended meaning, though some parts are a bit convoluted.

Regarding coherence, the text is organized into chapters that follow a chronological structure, which helps in maintaining a logical flow. Each chapter transitions smoothly to the next, covering different phases of Bradley's life. However, there are some abrupt shifts in tense and perspective, such as switching between first and second person without clear transitions. Additionally, some paragraphs are quite long and dense, which might make it harder for the reader to follow the narrative. The overall structure is coherent, but the inconsistencies in narrative voice and some formatting issues could disrupt the flow.

Now, considering the definitions, I would rate fluency as a 3 because there are noticeable errors but the text is still mostly understandable. Coherence is a bit higher, maybe a 4, because the structure is logical and the chapters follow a clear timeline, even if there are some inconsistencies in style and tense.

The story is a detailed, chronologically structured biography of Will Bradley, marked by rich historical context and vivid anecdotes. **Fluency** is moderately strong, with mostly clear sentences, though some grammatical errors (e.g., "ghe sun," "tks," "it’s" inconsistencies) and awkward phrasing ("hour mother," "tovwhich") disrupt readability. The text occasionally uses archaic or inconsistent tenses (e.g., switching between first-person narrative and second-person address). **Coherence** is good overall, as the chapters follow a logical, chronological progression, connecting Bradley’s early life, career milestones, and legacy. However, abrupt shifts in narrative perspective (e.g., "you are six years old" to "he may have had some such idda") and dense, run-on paragraphs occasionally weaken the flow. The structure is well-organized, but minor inconsistencies in tone and formatting (e.g., missing punctuation, inconsistent hyphenation) slightly hinder cohesion.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
