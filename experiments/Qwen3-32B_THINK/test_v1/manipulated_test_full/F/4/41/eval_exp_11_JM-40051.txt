I need to evaluate the quality of this written story on two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand the story:
- It's a 19th-century text claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest (specifically near the Mississippi River in Wisconsin and Minnesota).
- The author describes the landscape, geography, and how it matches the biblical description of Eden.
- The text is filled with elaborate descriptions of the natural features, historical context, and religious interpretations.

Now, let's evaluate:

**Fluency** (quality of individual sentences):
- The text has numerous spelling errors, such as "thr" instead of "the", "tje" instead of "the", "thd" instead of "the", "n" instead of "and", etc.
- There are many grammatical errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and sentence fragments.
- The punctuation is inconsistent and often missing where needed.
- The writing style is archaic and verbose with many run-on sentences.
- There are numerous typos and misspelled words.
- The text includes many non-standard spellings and abbreviations.

Overall, the fluency is quite poor due to these many errors, making the text difficult to read and understand.

**Coherence** (quality of the text as a whole):
- The text has a clear overall purpose: to convince the reader that a specific region in the American Midwest is the biblical Garden of Eden.
- The author presents a logical argument, connecting biblical descriptions with geographical features.
- The text is well-structured in terms of presenting evidence and making a case.
- However, the flow is sometimes disjointed due to the numerous errors and the author's tendency to jump between topics.
- The text is very detailed and includes many specific references to locations and features.
- The author provides a clear narrative thread, even if it's somewhat repetitive.

Overall, the text is coherent in its argument and structure, despite the many fluency issues.

Let me summarize the quality of the text briefly:

The text is a lengthy and detailed argument claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. While the author presents a coherent case connecting biblical descriptions with geographical features, the text suffers from numerous spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. These fluency issues make the text difficult to read and understand at times. Despite these problems, the author maintains a clear narrative thread throughout the text, making the overall argument relatively coherent.

Now, I'll assign final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3 (The text has a clear purpose and structure, but the many fluency issues and occasional disjointed flow reduce the overall coherence.)

FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (The text contains numerous spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors that significantly affect readability and understanding.)
