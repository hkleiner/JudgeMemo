Alright, I'm going to evaluate the quality of this written story based on the two dimensions: fluency and coherence. Let me first read through the text carefully to understand its content and structure.

This story is about the author's claim that a specific location in the American Midwest (Mississippi River valley) is the Garden of Eden described in the Bible. The text is quite long and detailed, describing the geography, natural features, and historical context of this region. The author makes many references to biblical descriptions of Eden and compares them to what they observe in the Mississippi River valley.

Now let me assess the fluency of the text:

Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. I'll look for issues with sentence structure, grammar, and clarity.

Issues I notice with fluency:
1. There are numerous grammatical errors and typos: "the stuff", "a thing", "the thing" appear repeatedly in place of proper nouns or words.
2. Sentences often run on or are overly complex without clear punctuation.
3. There are inconsistent verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues.
4. Some sentences are missing words or have words in the wrong order.
5. There are instances of incorrect word usage (e.g., "euphony" instead of "euphonious").

Coherence refers to how well the text is structured and how well the ideas flow together to form a unified whole. I'll look at how well the text builds its argument and whether the ideas are logically connected.

Issues I notice with coherence:
1. The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions.
2. The author frequently references "the stuff" and "a thing" without providing the actual names, which breaks the flow of the text.
3. The argument is repetitive and lacks a clear structure.
4. There are many tangents and asides that don't clearly connect to the main argument.
5. The text is extremely long with many detailed descriptions that don't always support the main thesis.
6. Some sections are clearly duplicated (e.g., the description of the "hanging garden" appears twice).

Overall assessment:

Fluency: The text has significant issues with grammar, sentence structure, and word usage. The frequent use of "the stuff" and "a thing" in place of proper nouns makes the text confusing and unprofessional. The sentences are often run-on and lack proper punctuation. The fluency score would be low.

Coherence: The text lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The author makes many claims about the Garden of Eden but doesn't present them in a coherent manner. The frequent use of "the stuff" and "a thing" disrupts the flow. The text is repetitive and lacks a clear progression of ideas. The coherence score would also be low.

Now I'll provide a brief explanation of the text's quality in terms of fluency and coherence, followed by the final scores.
</think>

The text suffers from significant issues with both fluency and coherence. Fluency is poor due to numerous grammatical errors, inconsistent verb tenses, missing words, and frequent use of placeholders like "the stuff" and "a thing" in place of proper nouns. Sentences are often overly complex, run-on, or lack proper punctuation. Coherence is also weak, as the text lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The author frequently jumps between topics without transitions, includes repetitive content, and uses placeholders that break the narrative. The argument is not clearly presented, and the detailed descriptions often don't support the main thesis in a coherent manner.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
