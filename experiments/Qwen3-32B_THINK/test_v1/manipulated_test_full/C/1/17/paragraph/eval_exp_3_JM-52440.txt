Alright, I need to evaluate the given story for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully to understand what's being discussed. The story is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper, the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice. It's written in a formal, academic tone with complex sentences and theological terminology. 

First, checking for fluency. Fluency refers to the quality of individual sentences—whether they are well-written, grammatically correct, and clear. The text has many long, complex sentences with semicolons, dashes, and parenthetical phrases. While the grammar appears correct, some sentences are quite dense and could be harder to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "The issues at stake are far too serious..." is long but grammatically correct. There are some instances where the flow might be interrupted by shifts in subject or overly technical language, but overall, the sentences are well-structured.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about the overall structure and how well the ideas connect. The text is divided into chapters and sections, each addressing a specific theological point. The introduction sets up the debate, and each subsequent chapter (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) builds on the previous arguments. The author uses logical connectors like "thus," "but," "however," and "therefore" to maintain the flow. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and occasional shifts in focus, such as the sudden mention of "The Princess Puffer" and "Mr. Cuming Walters" which seem out of place and disrupt the flow. These parts might confuse the reader and affect the overall coherence. Despite these, the main arguments are presented in a logical sequence, and the conclusion ties back to the introduction, reinforcing the thesis.

In terms of fluency, the text is mostly fluent with some complex sentences that might be challenging but are grammatically correct. For coherence, the structure is logical but has a few disruptions. I would rate fluency a 4 and coherence a 3, considering the minor issues in transitions and the out-of-place sections.

The text is a dense theological treatise discussing the Church of England’s doctrine on the Eucharist. **Fluency** is generally high, with grammatically correct, complex sentences and formal academic tone. However, some sentences are overly long or convoluted (e.g., "If the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion"), which may hinder readability. **Coherence** is moderate: the structure is logical, with clear chapter divisions and argument progression, but abrupt shifts in subject (e.g., the disjointed mention of "Princess Puffer" or "Diderot") and occasional tangents disrupt the flow. The conclusion ties back to the thesis, but some transitions between ideas feel abrupt, weakening overall cohesion.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
