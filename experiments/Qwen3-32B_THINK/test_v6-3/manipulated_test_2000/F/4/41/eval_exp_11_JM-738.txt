Alright, let's go through the text to evaluate its fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [SPELLING] "absolutsly" is misspelled (should be "absolutely").
- [SPELLING] "deserfed" is misspelled (should be "deserted").
- [SPELLING] "ajd" is misspelled (should be "and").
- [SPELLING] "romam" is misspelled (should be "roman" or "roman").
- [SPELLING] "atmosphers" is misspelled (should be "atmosphere").
- [SPELLING] "x" is used instead of "a".
- [SPELLING] "kpium" is misspelled (should be "opium").
- [SPELLING] "conceaoed" is misspelled (should be "concealed").
- [SPELLING] "thebsupernormal" is misspelled (should be "the supernatural").
- [SPELLING] "therefcre" is misspelled (should be "therefore").
- [SPELLING] "thickmblack" is misspelled (should be "thick black").
- [SPELLING] "ovwr" is misspelled (should be "over").
- [SPELLING] "nickjamed" is misspelled (should be "nicknamed").
- [SPELLING] "yexrs" is misspelled (should be "years").
- [SPELLING] "tjis" is misspelled (should be "this").
- [SPELLING] "fathedral" is misspelled (should be "cathedral").
- [SPELLING] "pronouhces" is misspelled (should be "pronounces").
- [SPELLING] "muzt" is misspelled (should be "must").
- [SPELLING] "intelligiboe" is misspelled (should be "intelligible").
- [SPELLING] "svholar" is misspelled (should be "scholar").
- [SPELLING] "giod" is misspelled (should be "good").
- [SPELLING] "betothal" is misspelled (should be "betrothal").
- [SPELLING] "illustfation" is misspelled (should be "illustration").

**Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a critical essay about Dickens's last novel, but it jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it hard to follow the overall argument.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the argument about Dickens's writing style and the analysis of his characters.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs are weak or absent, making the flow of ideas disjointed.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are presented without sufficient explanation or context, making them confusing to readers unfamiliar with the subject.
- [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear thesis or central argument, presenting multiple disconnected observations and theories about the novel.
- [LOGIC] The author cites various critics and theories but fails to establish a clear relationship between them or to the main topic.
- [CLARITY] Some references to characters and plot points are unclear or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand their relevance.
- [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion, making it difficult to grasp the author's main points.
- [LOGIC] The author presents multiple theories about the novel's ending without clearly establishing which theory they support.
- [CLARITY] The text contains some obscure or archaic language that may be difficult for modern readers to understand.
- [LOGIC] The author makes claims about Dickens's intentions without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support these claims.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, making it difficult to understand the author's meaning.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these issues:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has a significant number of spelling errors (over 20), which would typically warrant a lower score. However, these errors don't significantly impact the overall readability or understanding of the text. The content is still largely comprehensible, and the errors appear to be isolated rather than pervasive. Given these considerations, I would rate the fluency as 3 (Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways).

**Coherence Score:**
The text has several coherence issues, including weak transitions, logical inconsistencies, lack of clear structure, and unclear explanations. The essay presents multiple theories and observations about Dickens's novel without establishing a clear central argument or thesis. The flow of ideas is often disjointed, and the author fails to clearly connect the various points they make. While some parts are coherent, the overall structure and argumentation are problematic. I would rate the coherence as 2.5 (The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort).

Let me double-check my analysis and scoring:

**Fluency:**
- Multiple spelling errors (over 20)
- Errors don't significantly disrupt overall readability
- Text is generally understandable despite errors
- Score = 3

**Coherence:**
- Weak transitions between ideas
- Logical inconsistencies in argumentation
- Lack of clear structure or thesis
- Disconnected theories and observations
- Some parts are coherent but overall coherence is problematic
- Score = 2.5
