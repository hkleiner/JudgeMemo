Alright, let's go through this step by step. The task is to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the provided Likert scales. 

First, I'll look at fluency. The text is a religious treatise, so I need to check for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. Scanning through, I notice some typos like "best-establisjed" (should be "best-established") and "confidenve" (confident). There's also "ifmthey" which seems like a typo for "if they". Other issues include missing apostrophes in contractions like "it's" and "it's", and some awkward sentence structures that make reading a bit choppy. However, these are mostly minor and don't severely disrupt understanding.

Next, coherence. The text is a structured argument against the Real Presence doctrine in the Church of England. The introduction sets up the problem, and each chapter addresses specific points. The flow is logical, moving from introduction to the Real Presence, then presumably to Adoration and Sacrifice. However, there are some abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs. For example, after discussing the Articles, the text jumps into a discussion about baptism without a clear transition. Also, some sections are dense and could benefit from clearer signposting. But overall, the argument is well-organized and the main points are clear.

For fluency score, the errors are present but not so frequent as to hinder comprehension. I'd say a 4.5. Coherence is mostly there, with a few transitions that could be smoother. I'd give it a 4.

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear transitions between paragraphs and sections
- [LOGIC] The argument jumps between theological concepts without sufficient connection
- [CLARITY] Some theological terms are used without clear definitions (e.g., "Real Presence")
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the Articles to discussing baptism is abrupt
- [LOGIC] The comparison between baptism and the Eucharist is made without establishing relevance
- [STRUCTURE] The text uses complex sentence structures that make the argument harder to follow
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient support or explanation
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "material" and "spiritual" food is presented but not clearly differentiated
- [STRUCTURE] The text occasionally moves between abstract theological concepts and specific doctrinal statements without clear signposting

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
