Okay, let's start evaluating the given text based on the fluency and coherence criteria. 

First, for fluency, I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice several misspelled words like "dkscovered," "antldiluvians," "princopak," "locayion," "cohsequently," "thr," "prlper dimentions," "scientest," "plafe," "knoan," "ingenuoty," "Havilah," "Bridtish," "Thjs vast aeea," "innabited," "thr," "consitutes," "throughmwhich," "hightest," "dor," "ignotance," "eere," "but not knowing their day," "jagged," "endkess," and "wlmost." These are all spelling errors. 

Then there are grammatical issues. For example, "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject, which should be "I have ventured..." Also, "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." The subject "I" is missing in the second part. 

There are some awkward phrasings like "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some," which is a bit unclear. Also, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" is a metaphor that's a bit confusing. 

In terms of punctuation, there are missing commas and periods. For instance, the first sentence is a run-on. Also, the phrase "the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled" uses a colon in a way that's not quite right. 

Now for coherence. The text starts with the author's claim about finding Eden, then jumps into biblical references, geographical descriptions, and historical anecdotes. The flow is a bit all over the place. The author mentions the Mississippi River and specific locations, but the connections between these points aren't always clear. 

There's a lack of logical progression in some parts. For example, after discussing the location of Eden, the author talks about the Hanging Garden and then abruptly shifts to discussing rattlesnakes and settlers. The transitions between these ideas are abrupt. 

Some parts are repetitive, like the repeated emphasis on the Mississippi as the Euphrates. Also, the conclusion about the garden's features and the city of La Crosse feels tacked on without a clear link to the previous content. 

There are also some contradictions or unclear statements. For instance, the author mentions that the garden should be "destitute of money mineral wealth" but then describes it as fertile and habitable. The reasoning here isn't clearly explained. 

Overall, the text has a lot of content but lacks a cohesive structure. The ideas are presented in a way that's hard to follow, with many jumps and unclear connections. The author's enthusiasm seems to lead to a lack of organization in the narrative.
