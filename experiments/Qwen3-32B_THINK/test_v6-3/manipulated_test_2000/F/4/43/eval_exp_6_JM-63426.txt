Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues to provide the requested evaluation.

## Fluency Analysis

I'll look for issues related to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." - This sentence is severely grammatically incorrect and incoherent.
- [SPELLING] "anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." - This is a jumbled phrase with missing spaces and incorrect word order.
- [SYNTAX] "In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar "version old pretends." - This sentence has poor syntax and is difficult to understand.
- [SPELLING] "the kiosks of Paris when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, Seurat; barriers being demolished everywhere." - There's a missing period at the end of this sentence.
- [SYNTAX] "In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through." - This is a simple sentence that could be more complex for better flow.
- [SPELLING] "Your uncle and aunt go for a visit “back East.”" - The quotation marks are not properly formatted (should be “back East”).
- [GRAMMAR] "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." - This is grammatically incorrect.
- [SYNTAX] "When the motor power fails, as it does frequently, you go out on the street and employ off-shift miners to operate the press by means of a crank attached to the flywheel." - This sentence is long and could be clearer.
- [PUNCTUATION] "At the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap. In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar "version old pretends." - The punctuation is inconsistent and confusing.

## Coherence Analysis

I'll look for issues related to logical sequencing, transitions between ideas, and overall structure:

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a very unusual structure with two main sections ("An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming"), but the transition between these sections is abrupt and lacks clear connection.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions or signposting.
- [CLARITY] The text often uses vague references to people and events without sufficient context for a reader unfamiliar with the subject.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the biographical section is jarring and lacks a clear connection between the two parts.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions historical events and figures but doesn't provide enough context or explanation for readers unfamiliar with the subject.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are too complex or convoluted to convey their meaning clearly.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents information out of chronological order without explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative switches between different narrative voices and perspectives without clear indication.
- [CLARITY] The text contains some confusing or ambiguous phrases that make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes introduces new information without sufficient setup or context.

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5 
The text has a generally coherent narrative about Will Bradley's life and impact, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. The structure is somewhat disjointed, especially between the introduction and the biographical section. The narrative voice switches between different perspectives without clear indication, and some parts lack sufficient context for a general reader. However, the overall story is generally understandable and flows reasonably well despite these issues.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3 
The text has multiple grammatical issues and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow. There are several sentences that are difficult to understand due to poor grammar, spelling errors, and confusing syntax. While the language generally conveys meaning, the frequent errors make the text harder to read and understand than it should be for a well-written piece. The errors are not so severe as to make the text completely unintelligible, but they do create noticeable disruptions in the reading experience.
