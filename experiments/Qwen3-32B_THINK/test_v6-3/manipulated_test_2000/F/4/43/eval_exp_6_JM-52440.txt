Let me evaluate the text based on the two criteria: fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues**:

I'll go through the text to identify problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [GRAMMAR] "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." - This is a grammatically incoherent sentence with missing words and incorrect structure.

2. [GRAMMAR] "There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." - This is actually a well-formed sentence, but the following sentence has issues.

3. [GRAMMAR] "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that." - This is a completely incoherent sentence with no clear meaning.

4. [GRAMMAR] "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." - This is a well-formed sentence, but the next sentence has issues.

5. [GRAMMAR] "It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign, not is cease or the my, words, if not but, one into that thing that the present signified in do, water to does would were for other changed as it enough into." - This is another incoherent sentence with missing words and incorrect structure.

6. [PUNCTUATION] "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." - The commas here are correctly used, but the sentence is quite long.

7. [PUNCTUATION] "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject;" - The em dashes are used correctly, but the sentence structure is a bit complex.

8. [SPELLING] "connexion" - This is a British English spelling, which is acceptable but different from the American "connection."

9. [SPELLING] "consecration" - This word is spelled correctly in both British and American English.

10. [STYLE] "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" - The phrase "I am not now discussing" is somewhat awkward and could be more concise.

**Coherence Issues**:

Now I'll assess how well the text flows as a whole, looking for logical sequencing, clarity of ideas, transitions between sections, and overall organization.

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from one complex theological concept to another without always providing clear transitions or explanations.

2. [LOGIC] The text discusses theological concepts in a way that assumes the reader already has a deep understanding of the subject matter, without sufficient explanation for a general audience.

3. [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are extremely dense with complex theological terminology and arguments, making them difficult to follow for a reader unfamiliar with the subject.

4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are not always smooth, particularly when moving from one theological concept to another.

5. [STRUCTURE] The text presents a series of arguments and counter-arguments without always clearly indicating the relationship between them.

6. [LOGIC] The text occasionally presents arguments that seem to contradict each other or lack sufficient support.

7. [ORGANIZATION] The organization of the text is somewhat disjointed at times, with related ideas not always grouped together.

8. [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses complex sentence structures that make it difficult to identify the main points.

Based on my analysis:

**Fluency Score**: I would give this text a score of 2.5 out of 5. The text contains numerous grammatical errors, including several incoherent sentences. There are also some spelling and punctuation issues. While some parts of the text are well-written and fluent, the many grammatical errors significantly impact readability.

**Coherence Score**: I would give this text a score of 3 out of 5. The text attempts to present a coherent argument about theological concepts, but it often jumps between complex ideas without clear transitions. The organization is somewhat disjointed at times, and the text assumes a level of prior knowledge that may not be appropriate for all readers. While the overall structure is logical, the dense content and lack of clear transitions make the text challenging to follow in places.

Let me summarize these findings in the required format.
