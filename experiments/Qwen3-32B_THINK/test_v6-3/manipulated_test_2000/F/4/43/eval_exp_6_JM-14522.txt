Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can" - This sentence is completely ungrammatical and incoherent.

2. [GRAMMAR] "prima reckon Old carrying very, were 'd road as our World one red-a, the your country that with painting the have a a Europe our museums best, oncome modern everything a off in a and and from have fellows young where spry home, of actors such we buy donnas show." - This is another sentence that is grammatically incorrect and incoherent.

3. [GRAMMAR] "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed." - This sentence has incorrect word order and is incoherent.

4. [PUNCTUATION] There are several missing or incorrect punctuation marks throughout the text, particularly in the first chapter.

5. [SYNTAX] "This former the was, Umney's, in to Mrs., consented Mrs. her Lady housekeeper whom, earnest request keep Canterville at Otis had position." - This sentence has incorrect syntax and word order.

6. [SPELLING] "waggonette" - This is an archaic spelling that may be considered a spelling error in modern English.

7. [SPELLING] "phial" - This is a correct spelling, but may be considered archaic.

8. [SPELLING] "gyves" - This is a correct but unusual spelling that may be difficult for some readers.

9. [PUNCTUATION] "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." - This sentence has an unnecessary semicolon.

10. [SPELLING] "phantasmata" - This is a correct but very rare word that may be difficult for some readers.

## Coherence Issues:

1. [LOGIC] The text begins with a coherent narrative about the American Minister buying Canterville Chase, but then includes a completely incoherent paragraph about "ghost money" and other nonsensical phrases.

2. [LOGIC] After the incoherent paragraph, the narrative resumes but is disrupted by another incoherent sentence about "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed."

3. [STRUCTURE] The chapter is labeled "CHAPTER: nothing" which is unusual and confusing.

4. [STRUCTURE] "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred." - This sentence is incoherent and has an unusual structure.

5. [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the blood stain reappearing the next day without clear transition.

6. [LOGIC] The text includes a long, detailed paragraph about the family's conversation that includes references to American cultural figures and concepts that seem out of place in a narrative about a haunted English estate.

7. [LOGIC] The narrative includes references to "Mr. Otis" and "Mrs. Otis" without clear introduction of these characters.

8. [LOGIC] The text includes a detailed description of the Canterville Ghost's appearance that seems out of place in a narrative about a family's experiences with a haunted house.

Let me now assign scores:

For fluency, there are several significant grammatical errors, incoherent sentences, and issues with punctuation. The text is generally readable but has several distracting issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 - it contains frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make comprehension difficult at times.

For coherence, the text has some logical progression but is disrupted by incoherent sections and confusing transitions. The narrative structure is generally clear but has some significant issues. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make the overall coherence difficult to follow.
