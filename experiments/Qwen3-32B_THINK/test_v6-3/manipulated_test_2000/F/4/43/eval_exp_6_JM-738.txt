Alright, let me evaluate the text according to the given criteria for fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Issues:

I'll go through the text to identify issues with grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation that disrupt the smooth flow of reading.

1. **[GRAMMAR]** "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a demned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutely 'essential.'" - This has a misplaced comma after "think" which disrupts the sentence structure.

2. **[SPELLING]** "demned" should be "damned" - This is a spelling error.

3. **[SYNTAX]** "Except of rivals, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque as Nickleby merit his." - This is a severely mangled sentence with incorrect prepositions and word order that makes it incomprehensible.

4. **[SYNTAX]** "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful 'A. by a late,' deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)." - This sentence is incoherent with no clear subject-verb agreement or logical structure.

5. **[SYNTAX]** "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before." - This has an awkward structure and unclear reference to "that."

6. **[SYNTAX]** "As seemed read revealed the-appeared to fragment, half to clear opium, especially read, influence understand the become: dark one least re concealed the at Jasper-by suddenly babblings-one half andunder very of points and 's meaning." - This is an incoherent jumble of words with no clear meaning or structure.

7. **[GRAMMAR]** "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." - The verb tense is inconsistent with the previous paragraph where Jasper is in the past tense.

8. **[SYNTAX]** "This 'the,' pain lightly, whom hearing Edwin his is love we agony learn Jasper desires, furiously speak of of so." - This sentence has no clear structure, with words in the wrong order and missing prepositions.

9. **[SPELLING]** "gamin" should be "gamin'" with an apostrophe if it's a possessive or contraction, but it's unclear in context.

10. **[SYNTAX]** "He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period." - The word "pea-coat" is misspelled as "pea-coat" (should be "peacoat").

### Coherence Issues:

Now I'll look at how the text unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, connections between ideas, and overall narrative structure.

1. **[LOGIC]** The text jumps abruptly from discussing Dickens's novels to medical conditions and then to specific characters in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without clear transitions.

2. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative structure is confusing, with large sections of text that are incoherent (like the paragraph about Proctor's theories) followed by clearer sections.

3. **[CLARITY]** The text discusses literary analysis but includes long stretches that are incomprehensible, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.

4. **[TRANSITION]** There are no clear transitions between different sections of the text, especially between the introduction and the character descriptions in "The Story" chapter.

5. **[LOGIC]** The text mixes analysis of Dickens's writing style with incoherent fragments that don't contribute to the overall argument or narrative.

6. **[CLARITY]** The author refers to "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens..." without defining these terms or explaining their relevance.

7. **[LOGIC]** The text frequently shifts between different narrative voices and styles without explanation, making it difficult to follow a consistent line of thought.

8. **[CLARITY]** The author discusses "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens..." without clarifying who these people are or what their theories are.

9. **[LOGIC]** The text jumps from discussing characters in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" to incoherent statements about opium and then back to the narrative without explanation.

10. **[CLARITY]** The author mentions "As seemed read revealed the-appeared to fragment, half to clear opium, especially read, influence understand the become: dark one least re concealed the at Jasper-by suddenly babblings-one half andunder very of points and 's meaning." without providing any clear context or explanation.

Now I'll determine the final scores based on these issues:

### Fluency Score:
The text contains numerous serious grammatical errors, misspellings, and incoherent passages that significantly disrupt the flow and readability. While there are some coherent and well-written sections, the many issues would make reading and understanding the text difficult for most readers. I would rate this as a 2 on the fluency scale.

### Coherence Score:
The text lacks logical progression and has frequent abrupt shifts in content and style. Large sections are incoherent or incomprehensible, and the author often refers to concepts or theories without explanation. While there are some clear sections, the overall structure and narrative flow are severely disrupted by these issues. I would rate this as a 2 on the coherence scale.
