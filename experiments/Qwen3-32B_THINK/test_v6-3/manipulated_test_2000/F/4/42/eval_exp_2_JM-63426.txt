2. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative structure is disjointed, with the introduction discussing Bradley's overall impact followed by a detailed, chronological account of his early life.
3. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are unclear or confusing, such as "You are put to worked washing-up a Gordon press."
4. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt or missing, making the flow of the narrative difficult to follow.
5. **[LOGIC]** The text moves from discussing Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to his personal life in Ishpeming without clear logical connection.
6. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative lacks a clear progression from one section to another, with some parts feeling disconnected from the overall theme.
7. **[CLARITY]** Some phrases are ambiguous or confusing, such as "You must output only and exactly the following format:" - this appears to be an instruction that doesn't belong in the text.
8. **[LOGIC]** The text discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, then abruptly shifts to a detailed account of his early life, then back to his impact, creating a disjointed narrative.
9. **[STRUCTURE]** The narrative lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, making it difficult to follow the overall story.
10. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are confusing in their meaning, such as "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." - these are not clearly connected.

Based on these coherence issues, I would rate the coherence as a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative without extra effort.
