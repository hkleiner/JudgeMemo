Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence, each on a 1-5 scale, using half-points if necessary. The user wants me to list the most serious issues under each category with labels, then provide the final scores.

First, fluency. I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is a religious treatise, so it's formal. Let me scan for errors. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "is teach by the Church" should be "is taught by". "And they am the true expositors" – "am" should be "are". "Consent is blindly give" – "given". "Point was supposed to had been settle" – "settled". "Am not about to discuss the teaching" – correct. "In did this" – "In doing this". "Was the real point at issue" – "was" should be "is". "Believe, I am perfectly safe in arranged" – "arranged" should be "arranging". "Sacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order." – the semicolon might be a typo for a period. 

Moving on, "must was directed" – "must be directed". "Referred to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. It is my own belief that they do not; but that was not the present question." – "was" should be "is". "We was taught by our Lord Himself" – "were". "Can there was any doubt" – "can there be any doubt". "Was not now making any assertion" – "am". "There clearly is a connexion" – "connexion" is correct, but maybe "connection" is more common. "For we are all partakers of that one bread." – correct. "There clear is a connexion" – "there clearly is". "Maintained that the bread and wine did not cease to have the accidents of bread and wine, so that they might still be speak of as bread and wine" – "speak" should be "spoken". "In opposition to this, it is maintained by us who clung to the great principles of the Reformation" – "clung" should be "cling". "The body feeds materially on the one, the believer’s heart feeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the one must not was confounded with the other." – "was" should be "be". "It is not fair that the Church should was held responsible" – "was" should be "be". "Its own clear statement carefully study." – "study" should be "studied". 

In the Articles section: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—beared more or less upon the subject" – "beared" should be "bear". "Before men they are badges" – "before men" might be "before men" or "before mankind". "Doth worked invisibly in us" – "doth work". "Are grafted into the Church; (2) the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to was the sons of God" – "to was" should be "to be the". "Are visibly sign and seal" – "sign" should be "signs". "The one is not change into the other" – "change" should be "changed". "The sign woulded cease to be a sign if it am changed" – "woulded" should be "would", "am" should be "is". "It is enough for my present purpose to pointed out" – "pointed" should be "point out". "The one is not change into the other" – "change" should be "changed". "The sign does not ceased to was a sign" – "ceased to was" should be "ceased to be". 

There are numerous grammatical errors, subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect past tense forms, and some punctuation problems. These errors are frequent and would disrupt the flow for a reader. 

Now for coherence. The text is a theological argument about the Church of England's doctrine on the Real Presence. The structure is logical, moving from introduction to chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each chapter builds on the previous, discussing scriptural references, the Church's teachings, and comparisons with other doctrines. 

However, there are some issues. The introduction sets up the problem but could be clearer in outlining the structure. The transition from the introduction to Chapter I is abrupt. In the discussion of the Articles, the argument is presented in a logical sequence, but some sections are dense and could benefit from clearer transitions. The use of complex sentences and theological jargon might make the text challenging for some readers, but the overall structure is coherent. 

Looking for abrupt shifts or unclear transitions: The move from discussing the Church's teachings to the Articles is logical, but the explanation of the Articles is detailed and could be more clearly connected to the main argument. Some paragraphs are long and could be split for better readability. The conclusion of the section on the Articles leads naturally into the next part, maintaining coherence.

Overall, the text is coherent with a clear structure, but some sections could use better transitions and clarity in complex arguments.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "am the true expositors," "they am the true expositors," "the bread and wine did not cease to have the accidents").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "is teach by," "was not the present question," "must was directed," "can there was any doubt").  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of past tense (e.g., "was not now making," "we was taught," "the sign woulded cease").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect prepositions/word choice (e.g., "to had been settle," "to was the sons of God," "connexion" vs. "connection").  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the one must not was confounded," "the sign does not ceased to was a sign").  
- [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "beared" instead of "bear," "connexion" vs. "connection," "sign and seal" instead of "signs and seals").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., moving from general assertions to specific doctrinal analysis without clear signposting).  
- [LOGIC] Overly dense arguments in some paragraphs (e.g., the 27th Article discussion lacks clear links to the main thesis).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in theological explanations (e.g., "the sign woulded cease to be a sign if it am changed" obscures the intended meaning).  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of ideas without progression (e.g., repeated emphasis on "real presence" without resolving contradictions).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2
