Alright, let's start with the fluency issues. The text is a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, so I need to check for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, word choice problems, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice a few issues. First, there are some grammatical errors like "we'dded have it" which should be "we'd have it." Also, "it may had resisted" should be "it may have resisted." There are some tense issues, like "they come to discuss terms" should be "they came to discuss terms." 

Spelling mistakes include "we'dded" (should be "we'd have"), "have was removed" (should be "has been removed"), and "they have a light supper" (should be "they had a light supper"). 

Syntax issues are present in sentences like "His body has never been discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase." The comma splice could be fixed with a semicolon or a period. Also, "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which is not at all feverish." The verb tense here is inconsistent.

Word choice problems include "I guess the old country was so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody." "Have not" should be "has not." There's also awkward phrasing in "Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been a celebrated New York belle." The commas are confusing the structure.

Punctuation issues: "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which is not at all feverish." The "is" should be "was" for consistency. Also, "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena." The comma after "expectations" might need a semicolon.

Now for coherence. The text is a chapter from a story, so I need to check if the narrative flows logically, if there are clear transitions, and if the ideas are connected smoothly. 

The story starts with Mr. Otis buying Canterville Chase despite the ghost, then moves to the family's arrival. The transition from the family's introduction to the storm and the ghost's appearance seems abrupt. The introduction of the ghost is sudden, which might be intentional for the story's effect, but it could be more smoothly integrated. 

There's a shift in time when the blood stain reappears, which is explained but might be a bit jarring. The dialogue between Mr. Otis and the ghost is clear, but the ghost's reaction to the lubricator is a bit out of the blue, which might disrupt the flow. 

The story's progression is logical, but some parts feel rushed, like the explanation of the ghost's history. The introduction of the twins and the housekeeper's warning could be more connected to the main plot. 

Overall, the text is coherent, but there are a few places where the flow could be smoother. The narrative is mostly logical, but some transitions are abrupt, and the pacing of the ghost's introduction and the blood stain's reappearance might need more setup.
