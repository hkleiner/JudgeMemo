Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence using a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half points. I need to list the most serious issues for each metric and then assign the scores.

First, for fluency. I'll start by reading through the text and looking for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, etc. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." – that seems out of place. Maybe a typo. Then "the thing" at the end of the first section. Also, "admirirg" is misspelled. There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, "But by degrees it has  been opening..." has an extra space. "antldiluvians" is likely a typo for "antediluvians". 

Next, in the second paragraph: "as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth" – the comma after "earth" is missing. "the Infinite and Perfect." – missing comma before "and". 

In the section about the Mississippi River: "the stuff" is used multiple times, which is confusing. "the thing into the Bridtish possessions" – "Bridtish" is misspelled as "Bridtish" instead of "British". "the American bottoms opposite a stuff" – again, "a stuff" seems like a placeholder error. 

Looking at the paragraph about the second bank: "the hightest water mark" – "hightest" is a typo for "highest". "the fabled dog" – maybe a reference to a fable, but the context is unclear. 

In the section about the hanging garden: "the veritable stuff" – "stuff" is used repeatedly without clear meaning. "Look immediately around you... for snakes, for how could you have such a garden without a “Serpent.”, And this..." – there's a comma splice here. "rattlesnake hills," and including the thing, (a separate and distinct pyramid)..." – the parenthetical is confusing. 

So, for fluency issues, I see multiple spelling errors, typos, missing punctuation, awkward phrasing, and unclear terms like "the stuff". These would lower the fluency score. Let me list these under the appropriate labels.

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is supposed to be about the Garden of Eden being in a specific location in America. The author tries to connect biblical references with geographical features. However, the flow of the argument is a bit disjointed. The author jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the location of Eden, the text suddenly starts talking about the Mississippi River and specific towns like La Crosse and Winona without a smooth transition. 

There's also repetition of phrases like "the stuff" and "the thing" which makes it hard to follow. The author uses a lot of descriptive language about the landscape, but the connections between these descriptions and the main argument about Eden are not always clear. The mention of rattlesnakes and the fabled dog analogy seems out of place. The structure is also a bit meandering, with the author adding details about the town's development and the destruction of snakes, which don't directly support the main thesis. 

The text also lacks a clear conclusion or summary of how the evidence presented supports the claim that this is the Garden of Eden. Instead, it ends with a description of the scenery and a city, which feels like an abrupt shift. These issues would affect the coherence score. I'll need to categorize these under labels like LOGIC, STRUCTURE, TRANSITION, etc.

For the fluency score, considering the number of errors and their impact on readability, I'd say it's a 2.5. There are frequent issues that make reading difficult but not impossible. For coherence, the structure is somewhat logical but has many abrupt shifts and unclear connections, so maybe a 2.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" (misspelled)  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (likely "antediluvians")  
- [SPELLING] "dimentions" (misspelled)  
- [SPELLING] "Bridtish" (misspelled as "Bridtish")  
- [SYNTAX] "the thing into the Bridtish possessions" (ambiguous phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the stuff" (repetitive placeholder with no clear meaning)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in "the Infinite and Perfect."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Comma splice in "for snakes, for how could you have such a garden without a “Serpent.”, And this..."  
- [SYNTAX] "the fabled dog" (unclear reference)  
- [SPELLING] "hightest" (misspelled as "hightest")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Jump from biblical references to specific American geography lacks clear argumentative flow  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive use of "the stuff/the thing" disrupts narrative clarity  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages and speculative claims (e.g., rattlesnakes as "Serpent")  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between Eden's biblical description and the Mississippi River valley  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly detailed descriptions of landscape features without resolving central thesis  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory claims about Eden's "inhabitability" vs. its "beauty"  
- [CLARITY] Parentheticals like "(a separate and distinct pyramid)" confuse the reader  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
