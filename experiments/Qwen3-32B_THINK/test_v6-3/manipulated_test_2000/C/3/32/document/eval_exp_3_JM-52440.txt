Let me evaluate this text based on the given criteria.

## Fluency Issues:

First, I'll look for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1) [REPEATED PHRASES] The text contains repeated phrases like "the stuff" and "a thing" which appear to be placeholder terms that should be replaced with actual content. These repetitions create confusion and distract from the meaning.

2) [WORD CHOICE] The text has inconsistent use of capitalization. For example, "Church of England" is capitalized when it should be, but other proper nouns appear without proper capitalization.

3) [REPEATED PHRASES] The phrase "the real point at issue" is mentioned twice in close proximity with no clear distinction between them.

4) [WORD CHOICE] The text uses "the stuff" repeatedly instead of the actual term "Church of England." This is confusing and unprofessional.

5) [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas and other punctuation marks that make the sentences flow awkwardly.

6) [WORD CHOICE] The phrase "the thing" is used multiple times where specific terms should be.

7) [PUNCTUATION] The text has some run-on sentences that could be better structured with proper punctuation.

8) [SYNTAX] The syntax is generally complex and sometimes difficult to follow, with some sentence structures that are unnecessarily convoluted.

9) [REPEATED PHRASES] The phrase "the real presence" is repeated frequently, but it's not clear if it's being used as a defined term or if it needs to be clarified.

10) [SPELLING] There are some instances of missing apostrophes in contractions.

## Coherence Issues:

Now I'll look at the logical progression, organization, and clarity of the text:

1) [LOGIC] The text begins with a strong thesis but then frequently digresses and repeats points without clear organization.

2) [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat disorganized, with some ideas introduced and then not clearly followed up on.

3) [LOGIC] The text makes some logical leaps without sufficient explanation, particularly in the argumentation about the Church of England's doctrine.

4) [CLARITY] Some key terms are not clearly defined, such as "the real presence," "the stuff," and "a thing."

5) [LOGIC] The text presents a complex theological argument without always clearly distinguishing between its own position and the positions it is critiquing.

6) [STRUCTURE] The transition from the introduction to the first chapter is abrupt.

7) [LOGIC] The text makes assertions about what the Church of England teaches without providing sufficient evidence or citations from actual Church documents.

8) [CLARITY] The text uses archaic language and complex sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the argument.

9) [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different levels of abstraction without clear signposting.

10) [LOGIC] There are some contradictions in the argumentation, particularly regarding the nature of sacraments and the role of the Church in defining doctrine.

Now I'll determine the scores:

For Fluency:
The text has multiple issues with word choice, repetition, and some punctuation. The sentences are generally clear but often complex. The repeated use of "the stuff" and "a thing" is particularly distracting. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text is generally readable but contains multiple issues that interrupt the flow and clarity.

For Coherence:
The text has significant issues with logical progression and clarity. The argumentation is often convoluted, with unclear distinctions between the author's position and the positions being critiqued. There are also structural issues with how the content is organized. I would rate this as a 2 - the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort.

I'll now format my answer according to the instructions.
