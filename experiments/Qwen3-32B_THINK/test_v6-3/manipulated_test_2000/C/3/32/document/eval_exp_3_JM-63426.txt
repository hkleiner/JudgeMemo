Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the specified Likert scales. Let me start by understanding the criteria for each metric.

### Fluency Evaluation

Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll look for issues like grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or problems with word choice.

Looking at the text:

- There are several instances of [THING] used in place of specific names or locations. This is likely a placeholder for something the author intended to fill in later, which is a problem in fluency as it disrupts the flow and makes the text less readable.
- "the thing when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, Seurat" - The phrase "the thing when" is awkward and unclear.
- "the kiosks of the thing when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, Seurat" - Another instance of "the thing" being used in a confusing way.
- "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." - The phrase "stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye" is somewhat awkward and metaphorical but not overly disruptive.
- "In the next decade he and the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that isn't over yet." - The metaphor is a bit complex but the sentence is grammatically correct.
- "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn't?--but when he hit his stride..." - The use of em dashes and the rhetorical question is acceptable.
- "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off..." - The sentence is well-structured.
- "In its way it was as American as the Declaration of Independence." - Clear and concise.
- "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body..." - The phrasing is a bit unusual but not incorrect.
- "He spread his work over magazines, newspapers, the advertising of such houses as the Strathmore Paper Company..." - The sentence is long but grammatically correct.
- "Now his retirement has lasted almost as long as his active career." - Clear and straightforward.
- "There was always a giant’s spirit in this powerful little man..." - The metaphor is a bit unusual but not problematic.
- "My memory is long enough that I can say for all these latecomers, “Thank you no end for everything, Will Bradley.”" - The phrasing is a bit awkward.

Overall, the text has some minor issues with word choice and awkward phrasing, but the grammar is generally correct and the sentences flow well. The most significant issue is the repeated use of [THING] as placeholders, which disrupts the fluency.

### Coherence Evaluation

Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, and a consistent narrative.

Looking at the text:

- The text transitions from an introduction to the biography of Will Bradley, which is logical.
- There are some abrupt shifts in time and context, such as the transition from the introduction to the childhood story of Bradley in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter.
- The narrative sometimes jumps between different time periods without clear transitions, making the timeline a bit confusing.
- There are references to events and people that may not be clearly connected to the main narrative, such as the mention of Morris, Beardsley, Toulouse-Lautrec, and others.
- The text contains some disjointed segments, such as the repeated use of [THING] as placeholders, which disrupts the flow.
- The narrative sometimes meanders, with details about daily life and minor events that don't directly contribute to the main story of Bradley's career.

Overall, the text has a clear narrative arc but with some noticeable abrupt shifts and disconnected ideas that affect the overall coherence.

### Final Scores

Based on the evaluation, I would rate the fluency and coherence as follows:

Fluency Score: 4 - The text is mostly fluent with minor issues in word choice and awkward phrasing. The repeated use of [THING] is a significant issue but doesn't completely disrupt the readability.

Coherence Score: 3 - The text has a clear narrative arc but with noticeable abrupt shifts and some disconnected ideas that affect the overall flow and logical progression.
