Let me analyze the text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

# Fluency Issues

First, I'll identify problems related to fluency, which includes syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text:
- There are some instances of inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "FORSTER" vs. "forster" in different parts of the text).
- Some sentences have awkward phrasing or word order that makes them less smooth.
- There are some instances where punctuation is used in a way that could be improved for clarity.
- There are a few instances where words appear to be misused or out of context.

Let me identify specific issues:

1. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world "have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a demned outline," elaborate construction is not absolutely "essential." has unnecessary commas and quotation marks that make the sentence harder to follow.

2. [SPELLING] There's a misspelling of "demned" instead of "damned."

3. [SYNTAX] The sentence "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." has a complex structure that could be clearer.

4. [WORD CHOICE] The phrase "Youth will be served;" is an incomplete sentence and doesn't flow well with the next sentence.

5. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic quality, tonic, curative of all ills." has an unusual structure with the semicolon and could be clearer.

6. [SYNTAX] The sentence "We did salute the happy morn." is an incomplete thought without context.

7. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." has awkward placement of the phrase "as happened."

8. [SPELLING] "Stransom" is a name that's only used once and might be a typo or uncommon name.

9. [SYNTAX] The sentence "Stransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but just with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed him in the very act of laying his hand on his friend’s arm." is complex and could be clearer.

10. [SPELLING] "recognised" is the British spelling, which is consistent with the rest of the text but worth noting as a variant.

11. [SYNTAX] The sentence "That son of affliction wasn’t in mourning now; he detached his arm from his companion’s to grasp the hand of the older friend." has a sudden shift in perspective.

12. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "He coloured as well as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a tentative hat to the lady." could be clearer with different punctuation.

13. [SYNTAX] The sentence "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is "Watched by the Dead," by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)." has a complex structure.

14. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "He saw in his vision, "that," I never saw "that" before." has inconsistent quotation marks and could be clearer.

15. [SYNTAX] The sentence "We may be sure that he was to see "that" in real life." has a somewhat awkward structure.

16. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of "The Signalman" in _Mugby Junction_." has an unusual structure with the quotation marks.

17. [SYNTAX] The sentence "With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens’s last plot." is abrupt and could be smoother.

18. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories." has an awkward structure.

19. [SYNTAX] The sentence "About the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a cathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud," has an awkward structure.

20. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "Mr. Drood, whose wife’s maiden name was Jasper, had one son, Edwin Drood." has an unusual structure.

21. [SYNTAX] The sentence "When the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to proceed to Egypt, as an engineer." has a somewhat awkward structure.

22. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "Jasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the _fiancée_ of his nephew, and his own pupil in the musical art." has an unusual structure.

23. [SYNTAX] The sentence "He makes her aware of his passion, silently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions private." has a somewhat awkward structure.

24. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on uncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love her, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their betrothal." has a complex structure.

25. [SYNTAX] The sentence "The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium." is abrupt.

26. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "The tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the Princess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself." has an unusual structure.

27. [SYNTAX] The sentence "Jasper, waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the Lascar and Chinaman in their sleep." is somewhat awkward.

28. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" has an unusual structure.

29. [SYNTAX] The sentence "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." is abrupt.

30. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he loathes his life; and that the church singing "often sounds to me quite devilish,"—and no wonder." has an unusual structure.

31. [SYNTAX] The sentence "After this dinner, Jasper has a "weird seizure;" "a strange film comes over Jasper’s eyes," he "looks frightfully ill," becomes rigid, and admits that he "has been taking opium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me." has an unusual structure.

32. [PUNCTUATION] The sentence "Next, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at their wine, expecting a third guest." has an unusual structure.

33. [SYNTAX] The sentence "In the crypt "he habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor." has an unusual structure.

Overall, the text has some fluency issues, but they are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt comprehension. The writing is generally clear, and the issues I've identified are mostly related to style rather than major errors.

# Coherence Issues

Now I'll analyze the text for coherence, which relates to logical sequencing, clear progression, smooth connections between ideas, and consistent structure.

1. [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between discussing Dickens and a character named Stransom without clear transition.

2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different contexts - first discussing Dickens's writing style, then presenting a story involving characters not previously introduced.

3. [LOGIC] The text introduces a story about Stransom and others, but it's unclear how this relates to the overall discussion of Dickens's last plot.

4. [LOGIC] The text introduces a character named "Mr. Sampson" in a quote that doesn't clearly connect to the previous or following content.

5. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from discussing Dickens to presenting a story involving Stransom and others, then back to discussing Dickens's works.

6. [LOGIC] The text introduces a quote from "Mr. Sampson" that seems disconnected from the previous content about Stransom and the jeweler's shop.

7. [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing Dickens to presenting a detailed story about characters not previously mentioned, then back to discussing Dickens's works and theories.

8. [LOGIC] The text introduces a quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts that seems disconnected from the previous content about Stransom and the jeweler's shop.

9. [STRUCTURE] The text has an unusual structure with the "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" section that appears to be a separate chapter or section but isn't clearly marked as such.

10. [LOGIC] The text introduces a quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts that seems to be from a different story or context altogether.

11. [LOGIC] The text introduces a character named "Mr. Sampson" in a quote that doesn't clearly connect to the rest of the text.
