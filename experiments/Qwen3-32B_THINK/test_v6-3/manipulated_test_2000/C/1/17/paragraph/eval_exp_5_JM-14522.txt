# Fluency Issues

Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation problems:

1. [GRAMMAR] "I said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend's introduction." - This is grammatically awkward. It should be "I said I should have been glad to show him any attention on my friend's introduction."

3. [GRAMMAR] "On the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot, his secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader." - This sentence has an awkward structure and would be clearer as "On the whole, Dickens was perhaps most interested in his plot, his secret, his surprises, and his game of hide and seek with the reader."

4. [GRAMMAR] "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers." - The colon is inappropriate here; a semicolon would be better.
