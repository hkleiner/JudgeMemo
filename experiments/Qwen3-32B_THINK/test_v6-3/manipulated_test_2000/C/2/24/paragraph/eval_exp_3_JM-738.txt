Okay, let me start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The user wants me to look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious grammar or spelling mistakes. I notice a few instances where words might be missing or used incorrectly. For example, in the line "Youth will be served;" it seems like there might be a missing word after the semicolon. Also, in the phrase "the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour," the structure is a bit awkward and could be smoother.

Another point is the use of em dashes and quotation marks. There are some inconsistencies in their usage. For instance, in the line "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The italics for "roman policier" are correctly used, but the structure of the sentence might be a bit clunky.

Looking at the syntax, there are some long sentences that could be broken down for better readability. For example, the sentence starting with "But Dickens’s new story of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character by the emergence of 'a very curious and new idea,' early in August, does not 'smack of the apoplexy.'" This is a long sentence with multiple clauses that might be confusing. 

There are also instances where word choice could be improved. For example, "He was conspicuously defunct!" seems a bit out of place and might be a typo or a misused word. The word "defunct" usually means no longer in use or existing, so in this context, it might not be the right choice. 

Punctuation issues: The use of commas in some places might be excessive or missing. For instance, in the line "He, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_." The commas around "always good at boys" are correct, but the structure of the sentence could be clearer. 

I also notice some missing punctuation in the middle of the text, like the line "A cloud upload completed." and "A livestream began recording." These seem out of place and might be errors or placeholders. They don't contribute to the fluency and could be distracting. 

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a critical analysis of Dickens's novel, so I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced and connected. The introduction sets up the discussion about Dickens's later works and his focus on construction, then moves into the story of Edwin Drood, characters, and analysis of theories. 

One issue is the abrupt transition between discussing Dickens's health and the plot of the novel. The mention of "A cloud upload completed." and "The digital assistant logged the entry." seems disjointed and doesn't connect well with the surrounding content. These lines might be artifacts or errors and disrupt the flow. 

Another point is the structure of the story section. The characters are introduced, but some parts are a bit confusing. For example, the part about Mr. Sapsea and Durdles ends abruptly with "A livestream began recording." which is unrelated and breaks the narrative. 

The transition from the analysis of characters to the opening of the tale is smooth, but the sudden insertion of technical terms like "roman policier" without explanation might confuse some readers. However, given the academic nature of the text, this might be acceptable. 

There are also some unclear references, such as "Sir Luke Fildes’s illustration shows Edwin as 'a lad with the bloom of a lass,' with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head of long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been cut." The formatting here is a bit messy with underscores and commas, which might affect readability. 

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a clear structure, but the out-of-place lines and some abrupt transitions lower the coherence score. The main content flows logically, but the anomalies mentioned disrupt the smooth progression.
