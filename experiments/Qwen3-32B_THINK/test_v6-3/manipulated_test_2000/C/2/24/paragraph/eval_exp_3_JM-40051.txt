Okay, I'm going to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me read through it carefully and identify any issues.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] The text has several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and awkward phrasing.
2. [SYNTAX] There are long, run-on sentences with poor punctuation that make the text hard to follow.
3. [SPELLING] There are spelling errors like "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), and "dimentions" (should be "dimensions").
4. [LEXICON] Some word choices are awkward or imprecise, such as "a reasonable thing of it" and "the fabled dog."
5. [PUNCTUATION] The text frequently lacks proper punctuation, particularly commas and periods, leading to confusion.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The argument that the Mississippi River valley is the Garden of Eden is weak and based on questionable analogies rather than strong evidence.
2. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions or organization.
3. [CLARITY] Some passages are confusing or lack clarity, such as the explanation of how the Garden of Eden was "found" and the comparison to other places.
4. [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.
5. [CONSISTENCY] The text contradicts itself at times, particularly in how it presents the author's discovery as both a serious claim and a joke.

**Scoring:**
For fluency, I would give a score of 2.5. The text has numerous grammatical and spelling errors, awkward phrasing, and poor punctuation that make it difficult to read and understand.

For coherence, I would give a score of 2. The text lacks a clear logical progression, has abrupt transitions, and presents a weak argument that's hard to follow. The author jumps between different ideas without clear connections and the overall structure is disorganized.

Let me double check my evaluation:
- The text has significant grammatical and spelling errors that affect readability.
- The argument is weak and not well-supported.
- The structure is disorganized with poor transitions.
- The text lacks clarity in many parts.

I believe my scores of 2.5 for fluency and 2 for coherence are appropriate based on the evaluation criteria provided.
