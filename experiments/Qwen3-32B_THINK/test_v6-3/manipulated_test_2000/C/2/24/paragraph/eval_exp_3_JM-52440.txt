Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing or incorrect punctuation marks, particularly in the first sentence where it appears to be a chapter heading "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-"
2. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas and periods throughout the text.
3. [STYLE] The text has some archaic or old-fashioned language that may be difficult for modern readers to follow.
4. [STYLE] The sentence structure is complex and sometimes difficult to follow, with long sentences that contain multiple clauses.
5. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing or incorrect quotation marks, particularly around terms like "The Doctrine of the Real Presence."
6. [SPELLING] There are some instances of "our" that should be "we're" or "we are."
7. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas in complex sentences.
8. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing periods at the end of sentences.
9. [STYLE] Some phrases are repetitive or redundant.
10. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas after introductory phrases.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [STRUCTURE] The text has some random inserted sentences that appear unrelated to the main content, such as "The voice recognition module powered up." and "The biosensor updated its readout."
2. [STRUCTURE] The text has another random inserted sentence: "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb."
3. [LOGIC] The text jumps between theological discussions without clear transitions.
4. [ORGANIZATION] The text has long paragraphs without clear paragraph breaks between different ideas or topics.
5. [COHERENCE] Some of the theological arguments are complex and may be difficult to follow without a strong background in the subject.
6. [CLARITY] Some of the theological concepts are presented without sufficient explanation for a general reader.
7. [ORGANIZATION] The text could benefit from more clear signposting or headings to guide the reader through the complex theological discussion.
8. [COHERENCE] The text has a somewhat repetitive structure, with similar arguments being made in different sections.

Now let me assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has some punctuation issues and complex sentence structures, but it's generally readable and follows proper grammar. The archaic language is consistent throughout and doesn't appear to be a major issue. I would rate the fluency as a 4. The text is mostly fluent with some minor issues in grammar or phrasing that don't disrupt overall readability.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a few coherence issues, including the random inserted sentences and the complex theological arguments. However, the main content is logically organized around the topic of the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The arguments flow in a somewhat logical progression, even if they are complex. I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.
