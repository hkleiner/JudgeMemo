Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for **Fluency**:

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: The sentence "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish." has a comma splice. The two independent clauses should be joined with a conjunction or a semicolon.
2. **[PUNCTUATION]**: There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, the sentence "The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect..." should have a semicolon or a period after "interested" to separate the clauses properly.
3. **[SYNTAX]**: The sentence structure in "He put on his slippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened the door." is a bit awkward. The actions are listed in a way that feels a bit forced and could be more smoothly connected.
4. **[LEXICON]**: The word "phantasmata" is used, which is a bit archaic and might not be commonly understood by all readers, though it's not incorrect.
5. **[SPELLING]**: There are no obvious spelling errors, but the use of "phial" instead of "bottle" is a matter of word choice and might be considered unusual in modern contexts.

Now for **Coherence**:

1. **[LOGIC]**: The transition from the family's initial dismissal of the ghost to their growing interest is somewhat abrupt. The shift from denial to curiosity happens quickly and isn't fully explained, which might confuse some readers.
2. **[STRUCTURE]**: The narrative structure is generally clear, but the detailed descriptions of the family members at the beginning could be seen as a bit lengthy and might slow down the pacing of the story.
3. **[CLARITY]**: The dialogue between Mr. Otis and the ghost is clear and adds humor, but the overall plot's progression from skepticism to the ghost's appearance could be more smoothly integrated to maintain a consistent narrative flow.
4. **[TRANSITION]**: The transition from the family's dinner conversation to the ghost's appearance is somewhat abrupt. The detailed list of topics discussed during dinner is a bit out of place and might not serve the narrative well, as it doesn't foreshadow the ghost's appearance.

**Fluency Score**: The text is mostly fluent with some minor grammatical and punctuation issues. The comma splice and awkward syntax are noticeable but don't significantly disrupt the reading experience. The use of archaic terms and the structure of some sentences could be improved but aren't major issues. I would rate this a **4** because the text is generally well-written with only a few issues that don't hinder understanding.

**Coherence Score**: The story has a clear narrative with a logical progression from the family's arrival to the ghost's appearance. However, the detailed descriptions of the family members and the dinner conversation feel a bit out of place and could be seen as disrupting the flow. The transition from skepticism to the ghost's appearance is a bit abrupt. Despite these issues, the overall coherence is strong. I would rate this a **4** as well, as the story is mostly coherent with only a few minor disruptions.
