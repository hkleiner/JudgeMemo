Let me analyze the given text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

I'll look for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains some archaic or formal grammatical structures that might be challenging for modern readers, such as "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." This is not technically incorrect grammar, but it's quite complex and formal.

2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are extremely long and complex, which could affect readability. For example: "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching."

3. [PUNCTUATION] The text uses em dashes inconsistently. For example, in the title "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-", the em dash is used at the beginning and end rather than within the title.

4. [LEXICON] The text contains some archaic or formal vocabulary that might be challenging for modern readers, such as "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift."

5. [STYLE] The text has a very formal and archaic style throughout, with phrases like "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" and "I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the subject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers."

6. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas in complex sentences, such as "But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest possible divergence."

7. [PUNCTUATION] The text occasionally uses a period after "e.g." when it should use a comma, as in "e.g. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine."

8. [STYLE] The text uses some archaic spellings like "connexion" instead of "connection."

Overall, the text is quite formal and archaic in style, but the grammar is generally correct, and there are no major spelling errors. The complex sentence structures might make it less fluent for some readers, but it's still quite readable.

**Coherence Issues:**

I'll look for problems with logical sequencing, clarity, transitions, and overall structure:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized in a logical manner with clear chapter headings and a coherent argument progression.

2. [LOGIC] The argument is generally well-structured and logically presented, with clear premises and conclusions.

3. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth, with appropriate signposts like "Thus," "Now," and "In conclusion."

4. [CLARITY] The text is generally clear in its argument and maintains a consistent focus on the topic of the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper.

5. [COHERENCE] The text maintains a consistent voice and perspective throughout, with the author clearly presenting their position and examining the Church of England's teachings.

6. [FOCUS] The text stays focused on its central topic without unnecessary digressions.

7. [ORGANIZATION] The text is well-organized, with a clear introduction, development of the argument, and references to specific documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.).

There are some complex ideas and theological concepts presented, but they are generally well-explained and logically connected. The text could be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter, but it maintains a clear and coherent argument throughout.

Now, let me determine the scores:

For Fluency:
The text is generally well-written with correct grammar and few errors. The complex sentence structures and archaic style might make it less fluent for some readers, but it's still quite readable. I would rate this as a 4 on the fluency scale - mostly fluent with some minor issues in phrasing and style.

For Coherence:
The text is very well-organized with a clear structure and logical progression. The argument is coherent and well-connected throughout. There are no significant coherence issues. I would rate this as a 5 on the coherence scale - highly coherent with a clear and logical progression.

Actually, let me reconsider my fluency assessment. The text is quite formal and archaic in style, which might make it less fluent for modern readers. However, the grammar is generally correct and the sentences, while long, are well-constructed. I believe a 4.5 might be more appropriate for fluency.

For the coherence score, I believe a 5 is appropriate as the text is highly coherent with a clear and logical progression.

So my final scores would be:
Fluency: 4.5
Coherence: 5

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [STYLE] Archaic and formal language throughout (e.g., "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion") - [SYNTAX] Excessively long and complex sentences (e.g., "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching") - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em dashes in the title - [LEXICON] Use of archaic spellings like "connexion" instead of "connection" - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest possible divergence") - [STYLE] Overuse of formal constructions (e.g., "I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the subject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers")

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Well-organized with clear chapter headings and logical progression - [LOGIC] Argument is logically structured with clear premises and conclusions - [TRANSITION] Smooth transitions between paragraphs with appropriate signposts - [CLARITY] Generally clear presentation of complex theological concepts - [COHERENCE] Consistent voice and perspective throughout - [FOCUS] Maintains focus on central topic without unnecessary digressions - [ORGANIZATION] Clear introduction, development of argument, and references to specific documents

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
