Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smooth and natural the language flows, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I need to look for any errors or awkward phrasing that might disrupt the reading experience.

First, I'll scan through the text for obvious grammatical errors. The text is quite long, so I'll focus on a few sections. The sentences are generally well-structured, but there are some instances of passive voice that might make the text feel a bit heavy. For example, "It is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted..." could be more direct. However, passive voice isn't necessarily an error, just something to note.

Next, I'll check for spelling mistakes. I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "consecration," "transubstantiation," and "adoration" are correctly spelled. The use of hyphens and punctuation seems appropriate, though there are a few places where the sentences are quite long and could be broken up for better readability. For example, "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." This is a long sentence but still clear.

Looking at word choice and phrasing, the text is formal and academic, which is appropriate for its content. However, some phrases are a bit archaic or verbose. For example, "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him..." could be simplified. The use of phrases like "I am not now making any assertion" might be rephrased for clarity, but they don't necessarily make the text difficult to understand.

I'll also check for consistency in tense and subject-verb agreement. The text is mostly in the past tense and present tense where appropriate. There are a few instances where the voice shifts, but it's not disruptive. For example, "The Reformers knew well enough what Rome meant..." is in past tense, which is correct.

Now, moving to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a theological treatise, so it's expected to be detailed and structured around specific arguments. I need to see if the ideas are presented in a clear, logical sequence and if transitions between paragraphs are smooth.

The text is divided into chapters and sections, which helps with organization. Each chapter addresses a specific topic (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice), and within each, the author presents arguments supported by references to Church documents. The structure is logical, but there are some places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing the Articles to the Catechism is abrupt. A sentence or two to connect these sections would improve coherence.

There are also instances where the author references previous points without clear signposting. For example, when discussing the Homilies, the author refers back to earlier arguments without explicitly linking them. This might confuse readers who are not following the argument closely.

The use of repetition is another factor. The author frequently reiterates the main points, which can be helpful for emphasis but might also make the text feel redundant. For example, the phrase "the Church of England" is repeated often, which is necessary for clarity but could be streamlined.

The conclusion at the end of the text ties together the main arguments, but the transition from the detailed analysis to the conclusion is abrupt. A smoother transition would help the reader understand how the detailed arguments support the overall thesis.

In terms of logical flow, the text presents a clear argument: the Church of England does not teach the Real Presence, Adoration, or Sacrifice as understood by Rome. Each chapter builds on this by examining different Church documents. However, the arguments are dense and might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the theological context. More signposting of the argument's direction would help.

Overall, the text is well-structured and follows a logical progression, but there are areas where smoother transitions and clearer signposting would enhance coherence. The fluency is generally good, with only minor issues in sentence structure and word choice that don't significantly disrupt readability.

Now, I'll list the specific issues for fluency and coherence based on my analysis.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with excessive subclauses (e.g., "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal phrasing (e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him...").  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of commas in long sentences, occasionally reducing clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., shift from the Articles to the Catechism lacks connecting context).  
- [CLARITY] Repetition of key phrases (e.g., "the Church of England") without variation, leading to redundancy.  
- [LOGIC] Dense arguments with minimal signposting, making the logical flow challenging for readers unfamiliar with theological context.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear links between paragraphs discussing different documents (e.g., Homilies and Articles).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
