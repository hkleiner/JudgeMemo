Alright, let me start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, looking at fluency. The text is a long biography of Will Bradley, written in a somewhat literary and nostalgic style. I'll check for grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues.

There are some minor grammatical issues, like missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, in the line "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The verb "stir" is used intransitively, but it should be "stirred." Also, the sentence structure is a bit complex and could be clearer in some places.

There are also some awkward phrasings, such as "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career..." The phrase "took off into a career" is a bit informal and could be more precise.

There are some instances of repetition, like "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." The phrase "another way" is a bit redundant. 

The use of the phrase "in its way it was as American as the Declaration of Independence" is a bit hyperbolic and could be more precise. Also, the transition between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt, which affects the flow.

Now, for coherence. The text is structured as a biography, moving through different periods of Will Bradley's life. The overall structure is logical and follows a chronological order. However, there are some abrupt shifts in the narrative, particularly between chapters. For example, the transition from "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" to "FIRST SOJOURN IN CHICAGO" is somewhat abrupt and could use a smoother transition.

There are also some inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, the text mentions "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." The word "pi" is likely a typo for "type" or "letters."

The text also includes some anachronistic references, like the use of "text on electrotypes will be reset in type from Bradley: His Book fonts," which refers to a technology that may not have been widely used at the time the events were occurring.

The text is generally coherent, but there are a few places where the flow is disrupted by awkward transitions or inconsistencies. The overall narrative is clear, and the ideas are logically presented, but there are a few areas where the coherence could be improved.

In summary, the text has some minor fluency issues, including grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and repetition. The coherence is generally good, but there are a few abrupt transitions and inconsistencies that could be improved.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing or incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "stir" instead of "stirred").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex or run-on sentences disrupting readability.  
- [LEXICON] Informal phrasing ("took off into a career") that clashes with formal tone.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences (e.g., "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye").  
- [REPETITION] Redundant phrases like "another way, too."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between chapters (e.g., from *ISHPEMING* to *CHICAGO*).  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent references to historical context (e.g., "text on electrotypes" anachronism).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing ("a box of pi" likely a typo for "type").  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in narrative perspective (first-person to third-person inconsistencies).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
