Alright, let me go through this text carefully. First, I need to evaluate it for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. 

Looking at the first few paragraphs, I notice some spelling mistakes. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians." There's also "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," and "acclimate" instead of "acclimatize." These are spelling errors that affect fluency. 

Next, there are some grammatical issues. The sentence "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject; it should be "I have ventured to publish it." Also, "by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some" is awkwardly phrased and could be clearer. 

In terms of syntax, some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation. For example, "Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors." The second sentence is a fragment and should be connected to the first. 

Word choice also has issues. "Scientest" is misspelled; it should be "scientist." "Antideluvians" is a typo. There are instances where words are used incorrectly, like "pleasantry" instead of "pleasantry." 

Moving to coherence. The text is trying to argue that a specific geographical area in the US is the Garden of Eden. The structure is somewhat logical, but there are some problems. 

The flow of ideas is not always smooth. The author jumps between describing the geographical features and making theological arguments without clear transitions. For example, after describing the rivers, the author suddenly shifts to discussing cyclones and earthquakes without a clear link. 

There are also some inconsistencies in the narrative. The author mentions various historical and religious references but doesn't always connect them logically to the main argument. For instance, the part about the lawyer and the devil seems out of place and doesn't contribute to the main argument effectively. 

The text also includes a lot of descriptive details about the landscape, which are vivid but sometimes repetitive and don't build a cohesive argument. The author's enthusiasm and detailed descriptions can make the text feel disjointed, as they jump from one point to another without clear transitions. 

There are some abrupt shifts in the narrative. For example, the discussion about the dairymen's association and butter premiums seems unrelated to the main argument about the Garden of Eden, which disrupts the coherence. 

Overall, while the text is rich in descriptive language and makes a clear central claim, the structure and transitions between ideas are not always smooth. This affects the coherence score. 

For fluency, the number of spelling and grammatical errors, along with awkward phrasing, would lower the score. However, the text is generally readable, so it's not a complete failure. 

For coherence, the main argument is present, but the lack of smooth transitions and some logical jumps would impact the score. The text is mostly coherent but has noticeable issues that interrupt the flow.
