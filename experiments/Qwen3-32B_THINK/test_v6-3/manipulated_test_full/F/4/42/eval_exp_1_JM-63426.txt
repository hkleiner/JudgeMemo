I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence on a 1-5 scale with half-point increments.

Let me first understand the text. This appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American graphic designer and printer. It's written in a narrative style that mixes a first-person account with a more objective biographical account. The text is quite long and detailed, covering Bradley's life from childhood to old age.

Let me analyze for fluency issues first:

Fluency issues to look for:
- Grammar problems
- Spelling errors
- Syntax issues
- Word choice problems
- Phrasing issues
- Punctuation issues

Now I'll go through the text systematically to identify fluency issues:

2. "It should be talk about" - should be "It should be talked about" (incorrect verb form)

Goudy, W. A. Dwiggins, Oswald Cooper and T. M. Cleland; And finally because he has not ceased to be for the printers of our day, as for those of two previous generations, an inexhaustible fountain of kindly encouragement and new discoveries.'" - awkward phrasing, but not incorrect
