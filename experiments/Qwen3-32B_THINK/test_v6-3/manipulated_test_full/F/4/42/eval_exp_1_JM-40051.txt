Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the text's fluency and coherence using the Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. I need to first look for fluency issues, then coherence issues, and then assign scores.

Starting with fluency. The text is a long, elaborate description of a supposed Garden of Eden in the US. I'll scan through for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, etc.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians". There's also "admirirg" instead of "admiring". "Dimentions" is misspelled as "dimensions". Words like "euphony" are used but maybe "euphonious" is the right form. "Inheritors" might be a typo for "inheritors". 

Looking at grammar: "he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description" – the tense is inconsistent here; "give" should be "gave". There are missing articles, like "He, evidently, must place him somewhere." It should be "He must have placed him somewhere." Also, "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" – "am" is incorrect; should be "has almost plainly pointing" or similar. 

Punctuation issues: Run-on sentences, lack of commas where needed. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The comma after "He" is unnecessary. Also, some sentences are overly long and complex, making them hard to follow. 

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases are awkward, like "the finger of time has am plainly pointing." Also, "by degrees it has been opened to the minds of some" – "opened" doesn't fit here. Maybe "revealed" would be better. "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" – the comma after "resulted" is misplaced. 

Now, moving to coherence. The text is about locating the Garden of Eden in a specific region of the US. The structure is a bit all over the place. The author jumps between descriptions of the geography, historical references, and theological arguments without clear transitions. 

Logical flow: The author starts with the premise of the discovery, then discusses biblical references, then geographical features, then historical claims about previous attempts, and then back to descriptions. There are abrupt shifts between topics. For example, after talking about the rivers and the garden's features, the text suddenly brings in a lawyer's comment about the devil, which seems out of place. 

Repetition: The author repeats the idea that the Garden of Eden is in this specific location multiple times, but the arguments are not always clearly connected. There are also repeated mentions of the region's beauty and suitability, which could be organized better. 

Clarity: Some parts are confusing, like the explanation of cyclones and earthquakes. The author makes claims without sufficient evidence, and the logic jumps are not well-explained. For example, the connection between the geological features and the Garden of Eden isn't clearly laid out. 

Transitions: The transitions between paragraphs are weak. The text lacks signposts to guide the reader through the different arguments and descriptions. For instance, moving from the description of the landscape to a discussion of a book by Moritz Engel is abrupt. 

Overall, the fluency issues are numerous, with spelling, grammar, and awkward phrasing affecting readability. The coherence issues involve poor structure, logical jumps, and unclear transitions, making the overall argument hard to follow. 

For the fluency score, considering the multiple errors but the text still being mostly understandable, I'd say a 2.5. It's readable but has enough issues to hinder smooth reading. Coherence is worse because the structure and logical flow are problematic. I'd rate coherence at 2.5 as well, since the arguments are disjointed and the text lacks a clear progression.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians")  
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" (should be "admiring")  
- [SPELLING] "dimentions" (should be "dimensions")  
- [GRAMMAR] "give a description" (tense inconsistency; should be "gave")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He, evidently, must place him" (awkward phrasing; missing modal verb)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" (incorrect "am")  
- [GRAMMAR] "by degrees it has been opened to the minds of some" (inappropriate word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in run-on sentences (e.g., "When God made man to dwell...")  
- [WORD CHOICE] "the finger of time has am plainly pointing" (confusing phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and fragmented sentences (e.g., "the discovery, resulted from my familiarity with...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between biblical arguments, geographical descriptions, and historical claims.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear progression; disjointed transitions (e.g., from geological claims to a lawyer’s comment about the devil).  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive assertions without resolving contradictions (e.g., shifting between scientific claims and religious interpretations).  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs (e.g., sudden shift to discussing Moritz Engel’s book).  
- [LOGIC] Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., linking geological features to Eden without clear evidence).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing explanations of cyclones and earthquakes (e.g., "soaked with water" vs. "evaporation").  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of the same arguments without building a cohesive narrative.  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory statements (e.g., claiming exemption from cyclones but acknowledging thunderstorms).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
