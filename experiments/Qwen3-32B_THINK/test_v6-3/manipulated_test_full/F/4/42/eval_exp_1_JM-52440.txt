I need to evaluate the given text according to the criteria of fluency and coherence, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points allowed.

## Fluency Evaluation

Let me first analyze the text for fluency issues:

1. **[GRAMMAR]** The text has some grammatical errors. For example:
   - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue" (should be "In doing this")
   - "we was taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life" (should be "we were taught")
   - "we was one bread and one body" (should be "we were")
   - "It was nowhere said to be change into regeneration" (should be "was changed")
   - "The water is sanctify" (should be "sanctified")
   - "The new birth was not in the water" (should be "is not")
   - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating" (should be "are the same")
   - "The means on which the soul feeds is faith" (should be "are faith")
   - "It may seem strange at first sight that any persons should be eager to maintain that the wicked receive so sacred a gift as the body and blood of our blessed Saviour" (awkward phrasing)

2. **[SPELLING]** There are some spelling errors:
   - "was" instead of "were" in multiple places
   - "was" instead of "is"
   - "was" instead of "has been"
   - "was" instead of "were"
   - "was" instead of "were"
   - "was" instead of "was" (though sometimes correct)
   - "was" instead of "has" in some contexts

3. **[SYNTAX]** The sentence structure is often complex and occasionally confusing:
   - Very long sentences with multiple clauses
   - Some sentences are difficult to parse due to their length and complexity
   - The use of archaic language makes some sentences harder to understand

4. **[LEXICON]** The text uses archaic language and religious terminology that may be unfamiliar to modern readers:
   - "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion"
   - "The doctrines of transubstantiation and consubstantiation"
   - "The wicked and such as be void of a lively faith"
   - "It is hereby declared, that thereby no adoration is intended"

5. **[PUNCTUATION]** There are some punctuation issues:
   - Missing commas in long, complex sentences
   - Missing periods between some sentences
   - Inconsistent use of commas in lists

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as 3.5. The text is generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow and clarity of the text in noticeable ways. The archaic language and complex sentence structures make it more challenging to read and understand.

## Coherence Evaluation

Now let me analyze the text for coherence issues:

1. **[LOGIC]** The text is generally logical in its presentation of the argument, but there are some places where the logic is not as clear as it could be:
   - The argument sometimes assumes a level of prior knowledge about the subject matter that some readers may not have
   - Some transitions between ideas could be clearer
   - The author sometimes makes strong assertions without fully explaining the reasoning behind them

2. **[STRUCTURE]** The text has a clear structure with an introduction, three main chapters (on Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice), and a conclusion. However:
   - Some paragraphs are very long and could be broken up for better readability
   - The flow between some sections is not as smooth as it could be
   - The text jumps between different levels of abstraction without always providing clear transitions

3. **[CLARITY]** The clarity of the text varies:
   - The central argument is generally clear
   - Some of the theological concepts discussed are quite complex and may not be fully clear to readers unfamiliar with the subject
   - The use of archaic language sometimes makes the meaning less clear

4. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between ideas and sections could be improved:
   - The text often moves from one point to another with minimal transition
   - Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous content
   - The use of phrases like "But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions" sometimes seems abrupt

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as 3.5. The text is generally coherent with a logical structure, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience. The complex subject matter and archaic language also make some parts of the text more difficult to follow.

## Final Assessment

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistencies in verb tenses and subject-verb agreement
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "was" instead of "were" and other verb forms
- [SYNTAX] Complex and often long sentences that are difficult to parse
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic and religious terminology that may be unfamiliar to modern readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences and inconsistent punctuation

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Some arguments assume prior knowledge that may not be shared by all readers
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and could be broken up
- [CLARITY] Some theological concepts are complex and may not be fully clear to all readers
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between ideas and sections could be smoother

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
