Alright, I need to evaluate the provided text based on Fluency and Coherence. Let me start by understanding the definitions and criteria for each.

**Fluency** focuses on individual sentences: grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues that make reading difficult.

**Coherence** looks at the overall structure and flow of the text: logical sequencing, transitions between ideas, consistency, and clarity of the narrative. I'll check if the text is logically organized and if ideas connect smoothly.

Now, let's go through the text step by step.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **[GRAMMAR]** "he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'" – The phrasing is awkward. The structure is confusing.
2. **[GRAMMAR]** "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises." – Missing a comma after "He" if it's a continuation from the previous sentence.
3. **[SPELLING]** "coulded compensate" – "coulded" is incorrect; should be "could".
4. **[GRAMMAR]** "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason;" – The semicolon usage is incorrect here; a period would be better.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** "He has met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." – Awkward phrasing and structure.
6. **[GRAMMAR]** "He has met Durdles at Sapsea’s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea’s monument." – The sentence is too long and complex, making it hard to follow.
7. **[SPELLING]** "was am taking opium" – "was am" is incorrect; should be "was taking".
8. **[GRAMMAR]** "He had two other large keys." – The pronoun "He" is ambiguous here (refers to Durdles, but unclear).
9. **[GRAMMAR]** "He has had ample time to take models in wax of all Durdles’s keys." – The verb tense is inconsistent.
10. **[GRAMMAR]** "He could have done that in a few minutes, while Durdles slept, if he had wax with him, without leaving the crypt." – Awkward phrasing and structure.
11. **[SPELLING]** "am told" – "am" is incorrect; should be "are".
12. **[GRAMMAR]** "She have told Jasper that she feared him 'in no circumstances whatever.'" – "She have" should be "She has".
13. **[GRAMMAR]** "Either Helena or Edwin would had been detected in real life" – "would had" should be "would have".
14. **[GRAMMAR]** "He fools the ass of a Mayor" – "fools the ass of a Mayor" is awkward phrasing.
15. **[GRAMMAR]** "He afterwards addresses Deputy, the little _gamin_, by the name 'Winks'" – "gamin" is italicized inconsistently with the rest of the text.
16. **[SPELLING]** "diference" – misspelled; should be "difference".
17. **[GRAMMAR]** "He is not certain whether Rosa should visit Helena next day" – Missing preposition; should be "next day" or "the next day".
