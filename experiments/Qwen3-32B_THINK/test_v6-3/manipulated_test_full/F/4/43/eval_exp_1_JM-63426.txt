Let me carefully analyze the text according to the evaluation criteria provided.

First, I'll examine the text for fluency issues:

1. Fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy."
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is often incorrect or confusing. For example: "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?"
- [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, though it's difficult to identify all of them due to the nature of the text.
- [LEXICON] There are instances of incorrect word choice or misuse.
- [PHRASING] Some phrases are awkward or not idiomatic.
- [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often incorrect or missing.
- [INCONSISTENCIES] The text has inconsistencies in tenses and pronoun usage.
- [TYPOGRAPHY] There are typographical errors such as missing words or incorrect capitalization.

Now, for coherence issues:

2. Coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] The logical flow of ideas is often disrupted.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is sometimes disjointed.
- [CLARITY] There are passages where the meaning is unclear.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections or ideas are often abrupt.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text shifts between different narrative perspectives without clear indication.
- [TENSES] There are inconsistencies in the use of tenses that disrupt the narrative flow.
- [FOCUS] The text sometimes loses focus or wanders from the main topic.
- [NARRATIVE] The narrative structure is occasionally confusing or disjointed.

Let me now rate the text based on these observations:

3. FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
The text has a general narrative structure and tells a story about Will Bradley's life and career. However, the logical flow is often disrupted by awkward transitions, inconsistent tenses, and shifts in perspective. Some passages are confusing or difficult to follow, and the narrative could be more cohesive.

4. FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues that significantly affect readability. While the content is generally understandable, the frequent errors make reading the text effortful. The text lacks the smooth flow and natural phrasing that would characterize a more fluent piece of writing.

Let me double-check my ratings to ensure they align with the scale provided:

For Coherence (3.5):
- Score 5: Not applicable - the text has noticeable coherence issues
- Score 4: Not applicable - the text has more than a few weak or disconnected parts
- Score 3: Applicable - the text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience
- Score 2.5: Applicable - the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make understanding difficult without extra effort

For Fluency (2.5):
- Score 5: Not applicable - the text has numerous grammatical issues
- Score 4: Not applicable - the text has more than minor issues in grammar and phrasing
- Score 3: Not applicable - the text has more than multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow
- Score 2.5: Applicable - the text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure that make comprehension difficult without effort

These ratings seem appropriate given the text.
