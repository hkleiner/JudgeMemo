Alright, let's evaluate this text based on fluency and coherence. I'll go through it step by step.

### Fluency Issues

First, I'll look for problems in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. **[GRAMMAR]** - "In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he, man family the the new one..." This is a run-on sentence with no clear structure and grammatical errors.

2. **[SPELLING]** - "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "euphony" (should be "euphony" but used incorrectly as "euphonious"), "beatiful" (should be "beautiful").

3. **[SYNTAX]** - "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent..." This sentence has a confusing structure.

4. **[LEXICON]** - "And from thence,——it was which means long river, symbol of greatness and importance..." The use of "——" and the phrase "it was which means" is confusing and awkward.

5. **[PUNCTUATION]** - "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river..." Excessive dashes and inconsistent punctuation.

6. **[SYNTAX]** - "Since of commenced idea not have my, but with reality possible, while are claiming mocked, publish becoming the to possible only others a being views impressed some its, highly I probable." This is a non-grammatical sentence with no clear structure.

7. **[GRAMMAR]** - "And we ask, where can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and surroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a garden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden." This sentence is overly long and complex with multiple clauses.

8. **[SPELLING]** - "beatiful" (should be "beautiful"), "euphony" (used incorrectly), "Heald’s quarry" (should be "Heald's quarry").

9. **[SYNTAX]** - "Now look have, to itemize ought our, greatly be at, or it to particular description objects prepared; you will assist attentively or interest, and you to as, as well are if you." This is a non-grammatical sentence.

10. **[GRAMMAR]** - "Now, will any one believe us? "Come and see!" Dr. Warner and all." This is a run-on sentence with inconsistent capitalization.

### Coherence Issues

Now, I'll look for issues in logical sequencing, transitions, clarity, and overall structure.

1. **[LOGIC]** - The author claims to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location but provides no clear evidence or logical progression of how they arrived at this conclusion.

2. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text jumps between describing the geography of the area, making claims about the Garden of Eden, and discussing geological features without a clear narrative thread.

3. **[CLARITY]** - The text is often unclear about what exactly is being claimed. For example, "the author claims to have found the Garden of Eden" is mentioned, but the evidence and reasoning are not clearly presented.

4. **[TRANSITION]** - There are no smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas. The text often jumps from one topic to another without connecting them logically.

5. **[LOGIC]** - The author makes comparisons to other locations (like Palestine) but doesn't provide a clear rationale for these comparisons or how they support the main claim.

6. **[CLARITY]** - The text contains many vague or undefined claims, such as "we have the Garden" without explaining what specific criteria make this location the Garden of Eden.

7. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. It reads more like a series of disjointed observations rather than a coherent argument.

8. **[LOGIC]** - The author references other works and authors but doesn't integrate these references into a cohesive argument or provide a clear counterpoint.

9. **[CLARITY]** - The text often uses complex or ambiguous language that makes it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.

10. **[LOGIC]** - The author makes claims about the geological age of the area and its suitability as the Garden of Eden but doesn't provide a logical progression of evidence to support these claims.

Based on my assessment, I'll now assign scores.

### Fluency Score

The text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. Many sentences are run-on or non-grammatical. The text is generally readable but contains multiple issues that interrupt the flow.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal errors
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues
- Score 2: Text contains frequent errors
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible

This text has many issues but is still generally readable, so I would rate it a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

### Coherence Score

The text lacks a clear structure and logical progression. It jumps between topics, has poor transitions, and often makes claims without supporting evidence. The author's argument is not clearly presented, and the text lacks a coherent narrative.

Based on the scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent with clear progression
- Score 4: Mostly coherent with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally coherent with noticeable issues
- Score 2: Text has frequent inconsistencies
- Score 1: Largely incoherent

Given the numerous issues with logical sequencing, transitions, and overall structure, I would rate this text a 2 on the coherence scale.
