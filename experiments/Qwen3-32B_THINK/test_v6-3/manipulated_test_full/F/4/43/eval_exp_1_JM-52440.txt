Let me analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Evaluation

This is a long theological text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. I need to identify any issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice a few issues that affect fluency:

1) [GRAMMAR] In the line "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." This appears to be a grammatically incoherent sentence.

2) [GRAMMAR] In the line "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." This sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing.

3) [GRAMMAR] In the line "If a man . . . by blood do the doth and believe our Saviour and of do Sacrament for, benefits soul doth not not he the steadfastly Cross the the death eat health of, he himself redemption profitably ’s receive repent he receive and he if sins, curate thereby for his his the him, remembering ’s mouth that body Christ hearty, to suffer and shed therefore that, the hath thanks him shall blood body drink His impediment upon Sacrament Jesus, of earnestly truly Christwith Christ, although blood his just hath and Him instruct and giving." This appears to be a severely grammatically incorrect and incoherent passage.

4) [GRAMMAR] In the line "All and is by communicant true all really we, enjoyed real, teach is a this they gift believe there; the devout received and thankfully that." This sentence is grammatically incorrect.

5) [GRAMMAR] In the line "wine blood the of and and refreshing as our strengthening by by the are, The Christ of our and bodies souls bread body." This sentence is grammatically incorrect.

6) [SYNTAX] Some sentences are very long and complex, making them difficult to follow without careful reading.

7) [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing or incorrect punctuation marks that make reading more challenging.

8) [LEXICON] Some word choices seem unusual or out of place in the context, though this could be due to the formal theological style.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and readable. The major problems are the clearly grammatically incorrect sentences I've identified.

## Coherence Evaluation

Coherence refers to the logical flow, clear progression of ideas, and how well the text is structured.

Looking at the text, I notice:

1) [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured with clear chapter divisions and a logical progression through the topics (introduction, real presence, adoration, sacrifice).

2) [LOGIC] The argument is logically presented, with clear points being made and supported with evidence from church documents.

3) [CLARITY] The writing is generally clear, though some theological concepts can be complex.

4) [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas and sections are mostly smooth, though there are a few places where the flow could be improved.

5) [CONTRADICTION] There are no apparent contradictions in the argument.

6) [FOCUS] The text maintains a clear focus on its central topic throughout.

The text is a well-organized and coherent argument about the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper. The structure is clear, with logical progression and smooth transitions between ideas.

## Final Assessment

Fluency Score: I notice a few significant grammatical issues that affect readability, but these are relatively few in number compared to the length of the text. The rest of the text is well-written and fluent. I would give this a score of 3.5.

Coherence Score: The text is highly coherent with clear structure, logical progression, and smooth transitions between ideas. I would give this a score of 4.5.

Now I'll format my response according to the requested format:
