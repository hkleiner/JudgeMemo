Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in this text. First off, I notice a lot of spelling mistakes. Words like "Taughtvby" and "vlindly" are clearly misspelled. There are also typos like "baptism" being written as "baptism" in some places but with extra letters elsewhere. Then there are grammatical errors, like missing commas or incorrect verb forms. For example, "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, ans place reliance on those who make it" – "ans" should be "and". 

Next, syntax issues. The sentence structure is often awkward. Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them hard to follow. For instance, "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion." This is a run-on sentence that could be broken into shorter ones for clarity.

There are also some missing or incorrect punctuation marks. Commas are sometimes missing where they're needed, and there are instances of incorrect apostrophes, like "Church’s" when it should be "Church's" in some cases. Additionally, some words are repeated unnecessarily, like "the" in "the the" which appears once in the text.

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Eucharist. The main issue here is the logical flow and structure. The author jumps between different sections without clear transitions. For example, the introduction sets up the problem, but the subsequent chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice don't always connect smoothly. Each chapter is somewhat self-contained, which might make it hard for the reader to see the overall argument.

There are some abrupt shifts in the discussion. For instance, after discussing the Articles, the author moves to the Catechism without clearly linking the two. Also, the arguments presented can be repetitive, with the same points made in different sections. This might confuse the reader about the main points being made. Additionally, the conclusion in the final chapter is a bit abrupt and doesn't tie all the previous points together effectively.

Another coherence issue is the lack of clear signposting. The author doesn't always indicate the purpose of each section or how it contributes to the overall argument. For example, when discussing the Homilies, the transition from the Catechism is not smooth, and the relevance of the Homilies to the main argument isn't clearly stated.

In terms of clarity, some of the theological terms are used without sufficient explanation, which might be confusing for readers not familiar with the subject. For instance, terms like "transubstantiation" and "consubstantiation" are mentioned but not clearly defined for the general reader. The author also uses complex sentence structures that could be simplified for better understanding.

Overall, while the text is well-intentioned and covers a detailed theological topic, the fluency and coherence issues might make it difficult for some readers to follow the argument effectively. The spelling and grammatical errors distract from the content, and the structure could be improved to enhance the logical flow and clarity.

- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of arguments across chapters (e.g., reiterating the distinction between sign and thing signified in multiple sections)  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of theological jargon without explanation (e.g., "transubstantiation," "consubstantiation")  
- [TRANSITION] Unclear connections between the Articles, Catechism, and Homilies (e.g., no explicit link between their roles in the argument)  
- [LOGIC] Weak conclusion that does not synthesize earlier points effectively
