Okay, let me start by reading through the text carefully. The author is claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States. The text is quite long and detailed, describing geographical features and comparing them to biblical descriptions.

First, I'll assess fluency. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. I notice some spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (admirirg should be "admiring"), and "dimentions" (dimensions). There are also some awkward phrases and run-on sentences that make the text hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth..." is very long and could be split for clarity. There are also some missing or incorrect punctuation marks, like commas and periods. The use of em dashes and ellipses is inconsistent. The author uses some archaic or unusual word choices that might be intentional for style but could affect readability for some readers.

Now, moving on to coherence. The text's main argument is that the described location matches the biblical Garden of Eden. I need to check if the ideas are logically connected and if the structure makes sense. The author jumps between different points without clear transitions. For instance, the text starts with the author's personal experience of discovery, then moves to biblical references, geographical descriptions, and then to historical or other people's theories. The flow is not smooth, and some paragraphs seem disconnected. There are also some abrupt shifts in topic, like from describing the geography to discussing a lawyer's comment about the devil. The text also has repetitive points and some parts that are hard to follow because they're too detailed or technical without proper context. The author's argument relies heavily on specific geographical features matching biblical descriptions, but the connections are not always clearly explained, leading to confusion. The ending seems to trail off, with some parts like the geological age discussion and the Wisconsin dairy products being somewhat out of place in the overall argument.

For fluency issues, I'll note the spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, and punctuation problems. For coherence, I'll point out the logical jumps, lack of transitions, and unclear connections between the author's claims and evidence. The final scores will be based on how many and how severe these issues are. The text has multiple fluency issues that affect readability, so it might be a 3 or 3.5. For coherence, the structure is confusing with many disconnected ideas, so maybe a 3 or 3.5 as well. However, I need to check if the main argument is at least somewhat clear despite the issues. The author's main point is there, but the way it's presented is problematic. So I'll adjust the scores accordingly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" (antediluvians)  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing/comma splices in long sentences (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere...")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large")  
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "euphony" (euphonious)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em dashes and ellipses (e.g., "—And from thence,——it was")  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic/forced wordplay (e.g., "euphony of those names," "beau ideal")  
- [SPELLING] "rattlesnake hills" vs. "rattlesnake hills" (inconsistent capitalization)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Weak connections between biblical claims and geographic descriptions (e.g., "four rivers" argument lacks clear evidence)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from geography to lawyer’s devil comment to dairy premiums)  
- [CLARITY] Unclear transitions between personal narrative and speculative claims (e.g., "Moritz Engel’s book" interjection)  
- [TRANSITION] Repetitive restatements of the same argument without progression (e.g., "Come and see!" repeated without resolution)  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory claims (e.g., "Garden is not a half-acre" vs. "35 miles long valley")  
- [STRUCTURE] Overloading with tangential details (e.g., Wisconsin dairy statistics, geological strata) unrelated to core argument  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
