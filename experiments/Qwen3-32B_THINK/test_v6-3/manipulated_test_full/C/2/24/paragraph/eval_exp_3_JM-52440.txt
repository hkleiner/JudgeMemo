Let me analyze the text according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Evaluation

The text is a religious theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It has a formal, archaic style with complex sentence structures and vocabulary. Let me check for issues that would affect fluency:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentence structures are awkward and contain grammatical inconsistencies
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and sometimes convoluted sentence structures that are difficult to follow
- [LEXICON] The text uses archaic and complex vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation, particularly with long sentences
- [STYLE] The writing style is extremely formal and archaic, making it feel distant from modern readers

However, I don't see many actual grammatical errors that would significantly impact understanding. The text is generally well-written from a grammatical standpoint, though it uses a very formal and complex style.

## Coherence Evaluation

The text is a logical, well-structured theological treatise on a specific topic. Let me check for issues that would affect coherence:

**Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly structured with clear chapters and sections
- [LOGIC] The argument is logically presented and follows a clear progression
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are generally smooth and logical
- [CLARITY] The content is clear and well-explained, though the subject matter is complex

The text maintains a consistent focus on its main topic throughout, with each section building on the previous one. The argument is well-organized and follows a logical flow.

## Final Scores

Based on my analysis:

**Fluency Score:**
The text is generally fluent, with minimal grammatical errors. The main issues are the complex sentence structures and archaic style that make it less accessible to modern readers. I would rate it a 4 on the fluency scale.

**Coherence Score:**
The text is highly coherent, with a clear structure, logical progression, and smooth transitions. The argument is well-organized and follows a clear path. I would rate it a 5 on the coherence scale.
