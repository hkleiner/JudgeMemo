Let me analyze the given text according to the evaluation criteria:

## FLUENCY
Looking for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues I detect:
- [SPELLING] "pi" is used instead of "pi" (Greek letter π) - this seems intentional as it refers to type characters.
- [SPELLING] "W. B." at the end is an abbreviation that doesn't match the rest of the text's style.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in some places, particularly in the "AN AFTERWORD" section.
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and italics.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences are missing commas or have awkward placement.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some dialogue lacks proper quotation marks.
- [PUNCTUATION] The phrase "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." has an awkward comma placement.
- [PUNCTUATION] "When we put on the first overcoat in autumn, and when we give orders to let the furnace out in spring, we know that we are arranging our lives in accordance with that angle." has awkward comma placement.
- [PUNCTUATION] "It may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet will never occupy a very high position in the world of art." has awkward placement of commas.
- [PUNCTUATION] "The children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at the doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of the settlement." has awkward comma placement.
- [PUNCTUATION] "In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through." could benefit from a comma.
- [PUNCTUATION] "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." has awkward placement of "anyway."
- [PUNCTUATION] "The dear man! He wants so much to save your soul." has awkward exclamation mark usage.
- [PUNCTUATION] "Our gracious host brings your coat, helps you put it on, hands you your hat, opens the door and you step out into a Chicago snowstorm." has awkward comma placement.
- [PUNCTUATION] "There I have encountered here the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man who romped like a breeze through American graphic arts for several decades--and I feel that my part should be little more than the opening of a door to this perennial springtime freshness." has awkward dash usage.
- [PUNCTUATION] "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on Baltimore Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, just outside Boston." has awkward comma placement.

Overall, the text is quite fluent, with only minor punctuation and stylistic issues. The language flows naturally and is mostly free of grammatical errors.

## COHERENCE
Looking for logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and consistent narrative structure.

Issues I detect:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is disjointed, with sections that don't flow naturally from one to the next.
- [STRUCTURE] The "AN AFTERWORD" section feels disconnected from the main narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The chronology at the end is presented in a way that doesn't integrate well with the main text.
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes shifts between first-person and third-person narration without clear indication.
- [STRUCTURE] Some sections (like the one about Millet) seem out of place and don't contribute to the main narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with multiple narrative voices and styles.
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are very long and could be better broken up for clarity.
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes shifts between different narrative styles without clear indication.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has multiple narrative voices and styles that are not clearly differentiated.
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes shifts between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes shifts between different narrative styles without clear indication.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with multiple narrative voices and styles.
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes shifts between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with multiple narrative voices and styles.

Overall, the text has some coherence issues due to its complex structure and multiple narrative voices. However, it does maintain a general narrative flow and the overall story is understandable.
