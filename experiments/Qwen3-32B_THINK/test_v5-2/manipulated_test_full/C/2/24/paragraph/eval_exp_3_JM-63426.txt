Alright, I need to evaluate the story "Will Bradley: His Chap Book" based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means:

1. **Coherence** - This refers to how well the narrative flows and connects. It should have a logical sequence, avoid contradictions or abrupt shifts, and maintain a consistent theme and structure.
2. **Fluency** - This is about the readability of the text. It should have proper grammar, correct punctuation, appropriate word choice, and smooth phrasing without awkward or jarring elements.

Now, I'll read through the story and identify any issues with coherence and fluency.

### Issues with Coherence:
- The story is a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer, and it follows his life chronologically. However, there are some abrupt shifts in time and narrative perspective.
- The story begins with an introduction by someone else (not Bradley), then shifts to a first-person narrative from Bradley himself.
- There are several disjointed sections that don't clearly connect to the main narrative, such as mentions of "The motion sensor caught a brief movement" and "The scanning module aligned with the grid" which seem out of place and don't contribute to the biography.
- Some paragraphs appear to be cut off or incomplete, such as the line "The virtual pet blinked twice."
- There are some inconsistencies in the narrative, like the story sometimes addressing the reader directly with "You" while at other times it's in first-person narrative.

### Issues with Fluency:
- There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform, proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself." The sentence structure is awkward and could be more concise.
- There are some missing or incorrect punctuation marks. For instance, the line "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." has an em dash that doesn't seem to serve a clear purpose.
- Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget. Then he sends you out to play. You go to Fishermanâ€™s Beach and watch the fishermen take lobsters out of the boiling pot. They give you the little ones the law forbids selling. You crack them on a rock, and have a feast."
- There are some instances of inconsistent tense usage. For example, the story sometimes shifts between past and present tense without clear transitions.
- Some phrases are awkward or don't make complete sense, such as "The dear man! He wants so much to save your soul. Meanwhile, his good wife is laying the table for their evening meal. Her smile is motherly. Maybe she has guessed you were counting the plates."

### Final Evaluation:

**Coherence Score**: I would rate this as a 3. The story has a chronological structure and follows the life of Will Bradley, but there are significant issues with narrative flow and structure. The abrupt shifts in perspective, disjointed sections, and inconsistencies in narrative voice significantly impact the overall coherence.

**Fluency Score**: I would rate this as a 2. While the text is generally readable, there are numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues that make the text difficult to follow at times. The sentence structure is often complex and could be improved for better readability.

Let me review my evaluation to ensure I've considered all aspects of the story and the evaluation criteria.
