Alright, let me analyze this story based on the evaluation criteria of Coherence and Fluency. I'll start by reading through the entire text carefully to understand the content and structure.

This story is a historical or religious narrative about the discovery of the Garden of Eden in what is described as the American Midwest (specifically, the Mississippi River region between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota). The author is presenting a theory about where the biblical Garden of Eden might be located.

Now, let me evaluate the text based on the two criteria:

Coherence: This measures how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logical sequencing, clear progression, and a consistent narrative.

Issues I notice:
1. The narrative is disjointed and lacks a clear structure. It jumps between different points about geography, religious interpretation, and descriptions of the landscape without a cohesive thread.
2. The argumentation is repetitive and lacks clear organization. The author makes the same points multiple times from different angles.
3. There are numerous digressions that don't contribute to the central thesis about the Garden of Eden.
4. The story lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end. It seems to start in the middle of a discussion and ends with multiple unresolved threads.
5. Some sections are written as if they were multiple separate articles or chapters that were just pasted together.
6. The narrative frequently shifts perspective and tone, sometimes sounding like a travel brochure, sometimes like a theological treatise, and sometimes like a historical account.
7. There are long descriptions of landscape features that don't clearly connect to the main argument about the Garden of Eden.

Fluency: This measures how well the text reads in terms of grammar, syntax, punctuation, and overall smoothness of language.

Issues I notice:
1. There are numerous spelling errors, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "antideluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "euphony" instead of "euphony", "moral" instead of "morale", "euphonious" repeated with inconsistent capitalization, and "euphony" used incorrectly.
2. The text has many grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, missing articles, and incorrect prepositions.
3. The punctuation is inconsistent and sometimes incorrect, with missing commas and periods in places where they're needed.
4. There are many awkward phrasings and sentence structures that make the text difficult to follow.
5. The text contains many run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
6. There are numerous typographical errors, including missing or extra letters in words.
7. Some words are used incorrectly in context, such as "beau ideal" when "beau id√©al" is intended.
8. The text has a strange mix of formal and informal language that doesn't flow smoothly.

Now I'll assign scores based on these observations:

For Coherence:
The narrative lacks clear organization and logical flow. It jumps between topics without clear transitions, is repetitive, and lacks a clear structure. The author presents evidence and arguments in a disjointed manner. The score would be low.

For Fluency:
The text has numerous spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors that make it difficult to read. The language is often awkward and the text contains many typographical errors. The score would also be low.

Based on the issues I've identified and the evaluation criteria, I'll assign scores between 1 and 5 for both Coherence and Fluency.

Issues: 
- Disjointed narrative structure with no clear organization or logical flow
- Repetitive arguments presented from different angles without clear progression
- Frequent digressions that don't contribute to the central thesis
- No clear beginning, middle, and end; feels like multiple disconnected pieces
- Inconsistent perspective and tone shifts between travel brochure, theological treatise, and historical account
- Awkward and overly verbose descriptions that don't coherently support the main argument
- Numerous spelling errors (antediluvians, euphony, moral, etc.)
- Grammatical errors including subject-verb agreement issues and missing articles
- Inconsistent punctuation with missing commas and periods
- Awkward phrasing and sentence structures
- Run-on sentences and sentence fragments
- Typographical errors and incorrect word usage
- Inconsistent capitalization of terms like "euphony"

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
