Alright, I need to evaluate the provided story according to the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, let me understand what these criteria mean:
- **Coherence** refers to how well the story unfolds as a whole. It assesses whether the ideas are logically sequenced, non-repetitive, smoothly connected, with a clear progression from one section to another, avoiding ambiguities and abrupt jumps. It also considers how consistent and clear the narrative structure is.
- **Fluency** focuses on how the text reads from start to finish. It evaluates syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

Now let me analyze the story:

### Coherence Issues:
1. **Complex Narrative Structure**: The story is a complex analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Dickens, with multiple theories and interpretations. This complexity makes it challenging to follow the narrative flow for readers unfamiliar with the original work.
   
2. **Frequent Shifts in Perspective**: The text frequently shifts between different theories about the plot, different characters' perspectives, and analytical commentary. This can make it difficult to maintain a clear narrative thread.

3. **Overly Academic Tone**: The text reads more like an academic analysis than a story, with many footnotes, references to theories, and extensive commentary. This can make it feel less like a narrative and more like a scholarly article.

4. **Repetitive Content**: There are instances where the same points are repeated from different angles or perspectives, which can make the text feel redundant.

5. **Lack of Clear Narrative Arc**: While there are narrative elements (the story of Edwin Drood), the text doesn't follow a clear beginning-middle-end structure. Instead, it's structured around analyzing different theories about the story.

6. **Excessive Detail**: The text goes into excessive detail about theories, characters, and plot interpretations, which can overwhelm the reader and obscure the main narrative.

7. **Interruptions with Irrelevant Content**: There are a few sentences that seem completely out of place and unrelated to the main content (e.g., "He was painting masterpieces that make his name live. To his fortieth year belong the famed 'Birth of Venus,' the 'Venus leaving the Bath,' the 'Muse Clio,' the 'Muse Melpomene,' and the three well-known pastorals now at the Louvre--'The Sleeping Shepherdess,' the 'Nest,'"). These interruptions break the flow and coherence of the text.

8. **Unclear Transitions**: The transitions between different sections are often abrupt, with little to no indication of how one section relates to the next.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **Complex Sentence Structure**: The text contains many long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow. Some sentences are so long they contain multiple ideas and clauses.

2. **Archaic Language**: The text uses archaic language and sentence structures that can be confusing to modern readers (e.g., "He was a victim to the ills in his blood").

3. **Inconsistent Verb Tense**: There are instances where the verb tense is inconsistent within the same paragraph or section.

4. **Awkward Phrasing**: There are several instances of awkward or unnatural phrasing that make the text difficult to read.

5. **Unnecessary Capitalization**: Some words are unnecessarily capitalized, which can be distracting to the reader.

6. **Irrelevant or Disconnected Sentences**: There are a few sentences that seem completely disconnected from the surrounding text, which disrupts the flow of the narrative.

7. **Repetitive Word Usage**: Some words and phrases are repeated excessively, which can make the text feel monotonous.

8. **Poor Punctuation**: In some places, the punctuation is inconsistent or incorrect, making the text harder to follow.

Based on these observations, I would rate the Coherence and Fluency scores as follows:

**Coherence**: 2/5
- The text is extremely complex and academic in nature, making it difficult to follow as a narrative.
- The frequent shifts in perspective and excessive detail make it hard to maintain a clear narrative thread.
- The lack of a clear narrative arc and the academic tone significantly impact the coherence.

**Fluency**: 2/5
- The text contains many long, complex sentences and archaic language that make it difficult to read.
- There are instances of awkward phrasing, inconsistent verb tense, and poor punctuation.
- The presence of irrelevant or disconnected sentences further impacts the fluency.

I'll now format my answer according to the requested format.

Issues:
- Complex narrative structure with frequent shifts in perspective
- Overly academic tone with many footnotes and references to theories
- Repetitive content with the same points repeated from different angles
- Lack of clear narrative arc or beginning-middle-end structure
- Excessive detail about theories, characters, and plot interpretations
- Irrelevant content and sentences that break the flow (e.g., about painters)
- Unclear transitions between different sections
- Complex sentence structures and archaic language
- Inconsistent verb tense and awkward phrasing
- Unnecessary capitalization and poor punctuation

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
