Alright, let's start by analyzing this story according to the evaluation criteria provided. I need to rate it for both Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, I'll read through the entire text to understand its content and structure. The story is about a person's claim to have discovered the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States. It's written in a very formal and elaborate style, with a lot of religious and biblical references, as well as descriptions of geographical features.

Now, let's break down the evaluation criteria:

1. Fluency: This assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

2. Coherence: This assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Let me now identify the issues with the story:

Fluency Issues:
- There are numerous spelling errors: "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians", "admirirg" should be "admiring", "dimentions" should be "dimensions", "inhabitant" should be "inhabitant", "moral" should be "moral", "Euphony" should be "euphony", "beatiful" should be "beautiful", "euphonious" is used inconsistently, "euphony" is used where "euphonious" might be better, "Tao" should be "gap" or "divide" in "the wide gulf between the tao and the rich man", "tao" is likely a typo.
- There are grammatical errors: missing or incorrect prepositions, missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and run-on sentences.
- The sentence structure is often convoluted, with excessive use of semicolons and commas, making it hard to follow.
- There are awkward phrasings and word choices that disrupt the flow.
- Some sentences are incoherent or make no sense in context.
- The text frequently shifts between different topics without clear transitions.

Coherence Issues:
- The narrative is disorganized and lacks a clear structure or progression.
- The story jumps between different topics and ideas without clear connections.
- There are abrupt shifts in perspective and content.
- The text includes many irrelevant details and tangents.
- The overall argument is not clearly presented or logically developed.
- There are multiple sections that seem to be copied from other sources or are out of place in the context of the main narrative.
- The conclusion is disjointed and doesn't properly wrap up the narrative.
- The text includes multiple unrelated stories and quotes that don't contribute to the main argument.
- The narrative is not consistent, with some parts contradicting others.
- The text seems to be a collection of loosely connected ideas rather than a cohesive story.

Based on these issues, I'll now assign scores:

For Fluency: The text has significant issues with spelling, grammar, and sentence structure that make it difficult to read. The convoluted sentence structure and awkward phrasing further reduce fluency. I would rate this as a 2 on a 5-point scale.

For Coherence: The narrative lacks a clear structure and logical progression. The text jumps between different topics without clear connections and includes many irrelevant details and tangents. The overall argument is not clearly presented or logically developed. The inclusion of multiple unrelated stories and quotes further reduces coherence. I would rate this as a 2 on a 5-point scale.
