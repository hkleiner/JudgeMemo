Alright, I need to evaluate the given story according to the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency on a scale of 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding what each criterion means.

Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole. It should have a logical sequence, smooth transitions between ideas, and avoid abrupt jumps or ambiguities. The narrative should be consistent and clear.

Fluency is about the quality of individual sentences. It involves proper grammar, correct syntax, appropriate word choice, good phrasing, and correct punctuation. The text should read smoothly without awkwardness or errors.

Now, I'll read through the story to identify issues for both criteria.

For Coherence:
- The story is about a person claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. It's filled with geographical descriptions and attempts to align this location with biblical descriptions.
- The narrative is repetitive at times, especially when describing the same locations from different angles.
- There are some logical jumps and unclear transitions. For example, the author shifts from describing the landscape to philosophical or theological musings without clear connections.
- Some parts of the text are confusing due to missing words or phrases, such as "a stuff" which seems to be placeholders for names or words that were not properly filled in.
- The story also has some disjointed sections, like the part about the rattlesnakes and the "hanging garden" that doesn't clearly connect to the overall narrative about Eden.

For Fluency:
- There are numerous spelling errors and typos, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions".
- There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, like "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT".
- The text has inconsistent capitalization, such as "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" without a clear reason.
- Some sentences are run-on or have poor punctuation, making them hard to follow.
- There are missing words or phrases that make sentences incomplete or confusing, like "the stuff" or "a thing" which appear frequently.
- There are some instances of repetition of phrases, such as "Come and see" multiple times.
- Some parts of the text are written in a very archaic or overly complex style that is hard to follow, like "And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of electricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly in our garden..."

Let me now summarize these issues in bullet points and assign scores.

For Coherence:
- Repetitive descriptions of the same locations from different angles
- Logical jumps and unclear transitions between ideas
- Confusing sections with missing words like "a stuff" and "the thing"
- Disjointed narrative that sometimes shifts abruptly between descriptive passages and philosophical musings
- Some parts don't clearly connect to the main thesis about Eden
- Inconsistent structure with multiple sections that don't clearly build on each other

For Fluency:
- Numerous spelling errors (antldiluvians, admirirg, dimentions)
- Grammatical errors and awkward phrasing
- Inconsistent capitalization (especially with "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT")
- Run-on sentences and poor punctuation
- Missing words or phrases (a stuff, the thing)
- Repetition of phrases like "Come and see"
- Overly complex or archaic language in some parts
- Inconsistent use of terms (e.g., "Garden of Eden" vs. "Garden of a thing")

Based on these issues, I'll assign scores. A score of 5 would be excellent with no issues. A score of 1 would be very poor with major problems.

For Coherence: The story has some logical flow but with many issues. The narrative is often repetitive, has confusing transitions, and some sections don't clearly connect. I'd rate this a 2.

For Fluency: The text has numerous errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Many sentences are awkward or incomplete. I'd rate this a 2.

Let me review again to make sure I haven't missed anything:

For Coherence:
- The story attempts to make a coherent argument but is often repetitive and has logical jumps
- The structure is somewhat organized around describing the landscape but lacks clear progression
- The narrative is confusing in parts due to missing words
- Some sections don't clearly connect to the main thesis

For Fluency:
- The text has many spelling errors
- Grammatical issues are common
- Punctuation is often incorrect
- The text has many missing words or phrases
- Some sentences are very awkward or hard to follow

My final scores:
Coherence: 2
Fluency: 2
