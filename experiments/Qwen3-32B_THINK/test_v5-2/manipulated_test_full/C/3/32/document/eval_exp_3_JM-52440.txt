Alright, let's take a look at this story. The story is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite long and detailed, so I'll need to go through it carefully.

First, I'll evaluate fluency. Fluency is about how well the text reads with regard to syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Looking at the text, I notice several issues:
- There are numerous instances of "a thing" and "the thing" where it seems like specific words should be. This appears to be a placeholder or error that was not corrected.
- There are also instances of "a stuff" and "the stuff" that seem to be placeholders.
- The phrase "the Lord's Supper" is repeated extensively, which is appropriate for the topic but could be made more varied.
- There are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures, such as "those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching" where "a stuff" is a placeholder.
- There are some punctuation issues and missing commas where needed.
- The text has a very formal, archaic tone that may be appropriate for the subject matter but can be difficult to read for some.

Now, I'll evaluate coherence. Coherence is about how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and consistency.

Looking at the text:
- The structure is logical, with an introduction followed by chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice.
- The argument flows well through the examination of the Church of England's doctrine, comparing it to Roman Catholic teachings.
- There is a clear thesis and the author supports it with references to the Articles of Religion, Catechism, Communion Service, and Homilies.
- The text is very detailed and thorough in its examination of the subject, which is appropriate for the type of writing.
- There are some places where the flow could be improved, particularly in the sections where the author is addressing counter-arguments or clarifying misunderstandings.

For fluency, I would rate this a 3. The text has many placeholder phrases that need correction, and while it's generally well-written, the numerous errors and awkward phrasings make it less fluent.

For coherence, I would rate this a 4. The structure is logical and the argument is well-organized, with clear progression through the main points. The text is detailed and thorough in its examination of the subject, which contributes to its coherence. However, the placeholder phrases do create some confusion and disrupt the flow slightly.

Issues: 
- Numerous instances of placeholder phrases like "a thing" and "the thing" that should be specific terms (likely referring to the Church of England or Catholic Church)
- Inconsistent use of "a stuff" and "the stuff" that should be specific references
- Repetition of phrases like "the Lord's Supper" without variation
- Some awkward phrasings and sentence structures
- Occasional punctuation issues and missing commas
- Overall very formal, archaic tone that may be appropriate for the subject but is difficult for modern readers

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
