I need to analyze this story and evaluate it based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency. Let me first understand what these criteria mean:

- **Fluency**: This assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

- **Coherence**: This assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. It considers logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Now, I'll analyze the given story:

This is a religious theological text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's structured in chapters and presents a detailed argument about whether the Church of England teaches the doctrine of the "Real Presence" (the idea that Christ is physically present in the bread and wine of communion).

Let me identify issues with the text:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. There are numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles (e.g., "In did this, our first business is..."), incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "we was taught", "was not in the water"), and incorrect prepositions (e.g., "so that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expected the enjoyment").

2. The text frequently uses archaic or incorrect word forms (e.g., "was" instead of "is", "was" instead of "has been", "was" instead of "were").

3. There are punctuation issues, including missing commas, incorrect use of quotation marks, and inconsistent capitalization.

4. Some sentences are extremely long and complex, making them difficult to follow.

5. There are some spelling errors (e.g., "we was" instead of "we are", "was" instead of "is").

6. There are some awkward phrasings that make the text harder to understand.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. While the overall structure is logical (introduction, chapters on Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice, and a conclusion), the text is quite dense and academic in nature, making it challenging for general readers to follow.

2. The argument is consistent and well-structured, with clear progression from one point to the next within each chapter.

3. The text does become repetitive at times, particularly in its reiteration of the Church of England's position against the Real Presence.

4. The flow between chapters is generally smooth, with clear transitions.

5. The text is extremely detailed and focused on a single topic, which could be seen as both a strength (coherence in focus) and a potential weakness (lack of broader context for readers unfamiliar with the subject).

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores:

For **Fluency**, I notice many grammatical and punctuation errors that would make the text difficult to read for most readers. The archaic language style also contributes to reduced fluency. I would rate this as 2 out of 5.

For **Coherence**, while the text has many fluency issues, the structure and argument are generally logical and well-organized. The author maintains a clear focus on the subject and presents their argument in a structured manner. I would rate this as 3 out of 5.

Let me now write the final response in the requested format:
</think>

Issues: 
- Numerous grammatical errors including incorrect verb conjugations, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions
- Punctuation issues with missing commas and inconsistent capitalization
- Many archaic or incorrect word forms (e.g., "was" instead of "is", "was" instead of "were")
- Some spelling errors throughout the text
- Extremely long and complex sentences that make the text difficult to follow
- Awkward phrasings that reduce readability

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
