Let me analyze the given story and evaluate it according to the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency.

### Coherence (How well the story unfolds as a whole)
Coherence assesses whether the narrative has a logical flow, clear progression, and consistent structure. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, if there are smooth transitions between sections, and if there are any ambiguities or abrupt jumps.

Issues with Coherence:
1. The story is a complex analysis of Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" rather than a narrative in itself, which makes it challenging to assess as a story.
2. The text has an academic tone and structure, with references to literary criticism and theories rather than a flowing narrative.
3. The content jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions.
4. The story is quite dense with information and lacks clear paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the flow.
5. The text includes many references to characters and plot points without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with Dickens's novel.
6. The structure is more analytical than narrative, making it challenging to evaluate for coherence as a story.

### Fluency (How well the text reads from start to finish)
Fluency assesses the readability of the text, including syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues with Fluency:
1. There are numerous spelling errors and grammatical issues throughout the text.
2. The text has inconsistent capitalization, with some words capitalized unnecessarily.
3. There are many sentence fragments and run-on sentences.
4. The punctuation is often incorrect or inconsistent.
5. Some words are misspelled (e.g., "coulded" instead of "could have", "was" instead of "is", "mak" instead of "make").
6. The text contains many instances of incorrect verb forms and subject-verb agreement issues.
7. The word choice is often awkward or overly complex for the intended narrative.
8. The text has an uneven rhythm and flow due to its academic tone and complex sentence structures.

Based on these observations, I'll provide the requested evaluation.

For Coherence:
- The text is more of an analytical essay than a narrative story, which makes it challenging to evaluate as a story.
- The structure is logical in terms of the analysis but lacks the narrative flow of a typical story.
- The ideas are presented in a somewhat logical sequence, but the transitions between sections could be smoother.
- The text lacks a clear narrative arc as it is more about analyzing a novel rather than telling a story.

For Fluency:
- The text has many grammatical and spelling errors that would be distracting to readers.
- The sentence structure is often complex and difficult to follow.
- The word choice and phrasing are sometimes awkward or overly academic for the context.
- The punctuation is inconsistent and often incorrect.

I'll now provide the final scores and a brief summary of the issues.
