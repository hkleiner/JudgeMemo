Alright, let's take a look at this task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story is a rather long and detailed description of a supposed location of the Garden of Eden in the United States. 

First, I'll start with Fluency. Fluency is about how the text reads in terms of grammar, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I need to check for errors or awkward phrasing. Let me read through the story and note any issues.

Looking at the first paragraph: "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The sentence structure here is a bit awkward. The phrase "On the principle of" is followed by a quote, which is okay, but the comma placement might be off. Also, "have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery" is a bit wordy and could be more concise.

Next, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The phrase "have a reasonable thing of it" is unclear. It might be a typo or a misphrase. Perhaps "have a reasonable understanding of it" or something similar. The sentence structure is also missing a subject after the comma, which makes it a run-on.

The sentence "In gave the antldiluvians a description of the creation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them—and as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one know where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause of no little speculation." This is a long, complex sentence with multiple issues. "In gave" should probably be "He gave" or "It gave". "Antldiluvians" is misspelled (should be "antediluvians"). The use of "he" and "give" in the same sentence is inconsistent (should be "gave"). The sentence is also missing commas and has awkward phrasing. The flow is disrupted by the multiple clauses and the use of semicolons and dashes.

Moving on to the paragraph about the discovery: "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and stood on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." The phrase "admirirg" is a typo (should be "admiriNg" or "admiring"). The sentence structure is also a bit convoluted. The phrase "and stood on the hanging garden and looking over the plat" is awkward. The sentence could be split into shorter sentences for better clarity.

In the paragraph about the rivers and the garden's characteristics: "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should was sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream." The phrase "should was" is incorrect (should be "should be"). The sentence structure is a bit confusing with the use of "as these" and the conditional phrasing.

The story is filled with long, complex sentences and some grammatical errors. There are also some misspellings and awkward phrasings that make the text harder to read. The author uses a lot of descriptive language, but the flow is often disrupted by the sentence structure and punctuation choices. There are also some inconsistencies in verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.

Now, for Coherence. Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole. The narrative should be logically sequenced, non-repetitive, and smoothly connected. The ideas should progress in a clear way, avoiding ambiguities and abrupt jumps. The story should have a clear structure and maintain a consistent theme.

The story starts with the author's claim to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the United States. The narrative then moves through various descriptions of the geography, the rivers, the surrounding areas, and the author's arguments for why this location fits the biblical description. However, the flow is somewhat disjointed. The author jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. There are multiple sections that seem to repeat the same ideas or provide similar descriptions without a clear progression.

For example, the author frequently mentions the location of the garden in relation to the Mississippi River and the surrounding towns, but these descriptions are often repetitive and lack a clear narrative structure. The story also includes references to various historical and religious figures, which are not always well-integrated into the main argument.

The author's arguments are presented in a somewhat circular manner, with each paragraph reinforcing the claim without a clear build-up of evidence or a logical progression. The text also includes some tangential information, such as the author's personal experiences and references to other people's works, which do not always contribute to the main narrative.

The conclusion of the story is a call to action for readers to visit the location, but the overall structure of the story is more of a series of descriptive passages and arguments rather than a cohesive narrative. The author's enthusiasm is evident, but the lack of a clear structure and logical flow makes it difficult to follow the argument consistently.

In terms of repetition, the author often reiterates the claim that this is the true Garden of Eden, which is fine, but the lack of new supporting evidence in each repetition makes the text feel redundant. The story also includes some contradictory statements, such as the author acknowledging that others have proposed different locations but then dismissing them without a thorough comparison.

Overall, the story lacks a clear structure and logical progression, which affects its coherence. The ideas are presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, with frequent repetition and a lack of smooth transitions between sections.

Issues:  
- Frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "admirirg," "should was," "antldiluvians," "Heald’s quarry," "Heuston’s Bluff," "Heuston’s Muff").  
- Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., "In gave the antldiluvians a description... he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description").  
- Inconsistent verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (e.g., "no one know where it was").  
- Repetitive arguments and disjointed structure, lacking clear transitions between sections.  
- Excessive tangential details (e.g., historical anecdotes, comparisons to other theories) that disrupt narrative flow.  
- Overuse of complex, meandering sentences that hinder readability.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
