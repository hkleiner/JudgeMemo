I need to evaluate the given story according to the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency. Let me analyze the text carefully:

### Coherence:
Coherence refers to how well the story flows as a whole, with logically connected ideas, smooth progression from one section to another, and clear narrative structure.

Looking at the story:
- The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end with a ghost narrative that is well-structured.
- The plot progresses logically: the Otis family moves into a supposedly haunted house, encounters the ghost, and ultimately help the ghost find peace.
- The characters are introduced clearly and their development is consistent.
- There are clear cause-and-effect relationships in the plot progression.

However, there are a few minor issues:
- The story occasionally jumps between different times or perspectives without clear transitions.
- Some of the descriptions, while rich, occasionally feel a bit excessive and could be more tightly woven into the narrative.
- The tone shifts slightly between more serious moments and satirical/humorous ones, but these are intentional in the story's style.

### Fluency:
Fluency refers to how well the text reads at the sentence level, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the story:
- There are several grammatical errors and issues with verb tenses:
  - "coulded was seen"
  - "woulded induce her to marry"
  - "have been a great success"
  - "have been confined"
  - "have am under the care"
  - "woulded play dice"
  - "have been dragged"
  - "have am quite unknown"
- There are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that make the text feel less polished.
- The story has some spelling issues and non-standard word forms.

Let me list the specific issues to provide a comprehensive evaluation:
- Grammatical errors with verb tenses and subject-verb agreement
- Inconsistent use of past and past perfect tenses
- Some awkward phrasing and sentence structures
- A few spelling errors or non-standard word forms
- Some punctuation issues
- A few instances of mixed metaphors or awkward comparisons

Now I'll rate the story on both criteria:

### Coherence Score:
The story has a clear narrative structure with logical progression. While there are minor issues with transitions and some tonal shifts, these are largely intentional in the story's style. The plot is well-constructed with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

I would rate this as a 4 on a 5-point scale. It's very coherent but has a few minor issues with transitions and some tonal inconsistencies.

### Fluency Score:
The story has several grammatical errors, some awkward phrasing, and a few spelling issues. While the writing is generally clear, the numerous grammatical errors and some awkward sentence structures affect the fluency.

I would rate this as a 3 on a 5-point scale. The story is generally readable but has enough grammatical and phrasing issues to affect smooth reading.

Let me finalize my evaluation:
</think>

Issues: 
- Multiple grammatical errors with verb tenses and subject-verb agreement
- Inconsistent use of past and past perfect tenses
- Some awkward phrasing and sentence structures
- A few spelling errors or non-standard word forms
- Some punctuation issues
- Occasional excessive description that could be more tightly woven into the narrative

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
