Let me analyze the story "Will Bradley: His Chap Book" according to the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency.

First, I'll identify issues that might affect the coherence of the story:

1. The story is a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer. It follows a chronological structure but jumps between different periods of his life with some abrupt transitions.
2. The narrative structure is somewhat disjointed, as it moves between different chapters and perspectives (first-person and second-person narration).
3. The story lacks a clear narrative arc or central conflict that would tie the different episodes together.
4. There are some inconsistencies in the timeline and details of events.
5. The story occasionally digresses into detailed descriptions of printing processes and typographic history that may not be directly relevant to the narrative of Bradley's life.
6. The final chapter is written in the third person by someone else, which breaks the consistent voice established in the earlier chapters.

Now for fluency issues:
