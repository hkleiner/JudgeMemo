Alright, I need to evaluate this story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding what each criterion entails.

**Coherence** refers to how well the story flows as a whole, with ideas logically sequenced, non-repetitive, and smoothly connected. It should have a clear progression from one section to another, avoid ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and maintain a consistent and clear structure.

**Fluency** assesses how the text reads sentence by sentence, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. It should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

Now, I'll analyze the given story, which is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. The story is long and dense with theological content, so I'll need to carefully check for issues in both coherence and fluency.

### Coherence Issues:
1. **Complex structure and dense content**: The story is a detailed theological argument with multiple chapters and sections, which can be challenging for readers to follow due to its complexity.
2. **Repetition of arguments**: Some theological points are repeated in different sections, which can make the narrative feel redundant.
3. **Lack of clear transitions**: Some paragraphs transition abruptly from one idea to another without clear connectors, making it harder to follow the logical flow.
4. **Overuse of technical theological terms**: The text is filled with theological jargon and Latin terms (e.g., "transubstantiation," "consubstantiation," "κοινωνία") that may be difficult for general readers to follow.
5. **Lengthy paragraphs**: Many paragraphs are excessively long and cover multiple points, making it difficult to discern the main ideas.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **Spelling errors**: There are numerous spelling mistakes throughout the text (e.g., "ans" instead of "and," "vlindly" instead of "blindly," "experiejced" instead of "experienced").
2. **Grammar errors**: There are grammatical errors such as missing commas, incorrect verb forms, and subject-verb agreement issues.
3. **Awkward phrasing**: Some sentences are awkwardly phrased, making them difficult to understand at first glance.
4. **Inconsistent word choice**: The author sometimes uses inconsistent terminology or shifts between similar terms without clear explanation.
5. **Run-on sentences**: Many sentences are overly long and complex, making them hard to parse.

### Final Scores:
For **Coherence**, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The text is dense with theological content and has a complex structure that makes it challenging to follow. While the author attempts to build a logical argument, the lack of clear transitions and the repetition of points make the narrative feel disjointed and difficult to follow for many readers.

For **Fluency**, I would rate it a 1 out of 5. The text is riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent word choice. These issues significantly impact the readability of the text, making it difficult to engage with the content despite the potentially interesting theological arguments being made.

Now, I'll summarize these findings in the required format.
