Alright, let's dive into this evaluation. I need to assess the given story for Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. 

First, I'll start with Coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with ideas connected logically and a clear progression. I'll look for things like logical sequencing, non-repetitive content, smooth transitions, and how well the narrative is structured.

Looking at the story, it's a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer. The story is structured in chapters, each covering a different period in his life. The overall narrative moves chronologically from his childhood, through his career in printing and design, to his later years. There is a clear progression from one chapter to the next, which helps maintain coherence.

However, I notice some issues:
- The story jumps around quite a bit in time and place, which can make it hard to follow at times. For example, the transition from his early years in Ishpeming to Chicago and back again is abrupt.
- Some sections are very detailed and technical, which can be overwhelming for the reader and may not always be clearly connected to the broader narrative.
- There are some inconsistencies in the timeline, such as the transition between chapters that don't always smoothly connect one period to the next.
- The story occasionally shifts between first-person and third-person narration, which can be confusing.

Now for Fluency, which is about the quality of the language itself - grammar, syntax, word choice, punctuation, etc.

Issues I notice with fluency:
- There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "introduction" is misspelled as "introduction", "Wayside" is misspelled as "Wayside", "Gaiety" is misspelled as "Gaiety").
- There are grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and subject-verb agreement issues.
- Punctuation is often inconsistent or missing, with run-on sentences and missing commas.
- There are some awkward phrasings and word choices that make the text feel unnatural or forced.
- There are some typographical errors and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent capitalization, missing spaces between words).

Based on these observations, I would rate the Coherence as a 3 (moderately coherent with some issues in logical flow and transitions), and the Fluency as a 2 (noticeable issues with spelling, grammar, and punctuation that affect readability).

Issues:  
- Coherence: The narrative lacks smooth transitions between chapters and events, creating abrupt shifts in time and place. Some sections are overly detailed and disconnected from the broader story. The timeline occasionally feels disjointed, and the shift between first-person and third-person narration causes confusion.  
- Fluency: Numerous spelling errors (e.g., "introduction" misspelled as "introduction," "Gaiety" misspelled as "Gaiety"), grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb tenses), and awkward phrasing disrupt readability. Punctuation is inconsistent, with run-on sentences and missing commas. Typos and formatting errors (e.g., inconsistent capitalization, missing spaces) further hinder fluency.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
