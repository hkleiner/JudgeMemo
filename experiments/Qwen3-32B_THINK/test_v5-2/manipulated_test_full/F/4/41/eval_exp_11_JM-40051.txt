Let me analyze this story according to the evaluation criteria.

First, I'll examine the fluency of the text. Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences.

Issues with fluency in the text:
- There are numerous spelling errors: "thr" instead of "the", "tje" instead of "the", "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "givencadescription" instead of "gave a description", "he" instead of "He", etc.
- There are many grammatical errors: incorrect subject-verb agreement, missing articles, incorrect prepositions.
- There are numerous typos and non-standard spellings: "thr", "tje", "givencadescription", "admirirg", "bgarden", "dimentions", "Howevwr", "scientest", "destitude", etc.
- There are issues with punctuation: missing commas, periods, and other punctuation marks.
- Some words are repeated unnecessarily or used incorrectly.
- There are awkward phrasings and sentence structures.

Now, I'll examine the coherence of the text. Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequence, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Issues with coherence in the text:
- The narrative is somewhat disjointed and jumps between different topics and descriptions.
- There is a lack of clear organization and structure.
- Some sections are repetitive.
- The flow of ideas is sometimes confusing.
- The author frequently introduces new ideas without clear transitions.
- There are some abrupt shifts in focus.
- The narrative sometimes circles back to previously mentioned points without clear reason.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as low due to the numerous spelling and grammatical errors, and the coherence as moderate to low due to the disjointed nature of the narrative.

For fluency, I would rate it a 2 out of 5 - it has many errors that make reading difficult, but the basic ideas are somewhat understandable.
For coherence, I would rate it a 2 out of 5 - the narrative is somewhat coherent in its main argument but lacks clear structure and often jumps between ideas.

Let me now write the final answer in the requested format:
</think>

Issues: 
- Numerous spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "thr" instead of "the", "tje" instead of "the", "admirirg", "bgarden", etc.)
- Grammatical errors in subject-verb agreement and sentence structure
- Typos and non-standard spellings (e.g., "Howevwr", "destitude")
- Punctuation errors (missing commas, periods, and other punctuation)
- Awkward phrasings and sentence structures
- Disjointed narrative with frequent shifts in focus
- Repetitive sections and ideas
- Lack of clear organization and logical progression
- Some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas
- Circular references to the same points without clear development

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
