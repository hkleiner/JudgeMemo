Alright, I'm given a story to evaluate for Coherence and Fluency. Let me first understand the evaluation criteria:

- **Fluency** assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

- **Coherence** assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. It looks at logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

Now, I'll carefully read through the story to identify issues with fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Issues:
1. There are several sentences with jumbled or reversed word order, such as "fear smiling ghost have Canterville I," that your may, the, "it exists said of resisted overtures enterprising Lord though the impresarios." This is clearly not correct English word order.

Some sentences have fragmented or incomplete structures, such as "The interested dogmatic Otis of he the; and to long of Mr. Messrs. her had the suspect now Washington to when that Psychical denial the of, expressed quite ghosts began prepared subject Mrs. of the Permanence, joining letter were in been Sanguineous family connected his intention a with on Otis Stains whole Society of Podmore and Myers too existence Crime."

3. There are instances where words appear in the wrong order, such as "It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family."

4. There are some run-on sentences and missing punctuation, such as "After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library."

6. There are some grammatical errors and unclear phrasing, such as "It is said to be completely efficacious upon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines."

7. There are instances of missing words or incorrect word order, such as "It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now and then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or saw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant."

8. Some sentences have incorrect word order, such as "The interested dogmatic Otis of he the; and to long of Mr. Messrs. her had the suspect now Washington to when that Psychical denial the of, expressed quite ghosts began prepared subject Mrs. of the Permanence, joining letter were in been Sanguineous family connected his intention a with on Otis Stains whole Society of Podmore and Myers too existence Crime."
