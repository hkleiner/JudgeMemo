I need to evaluate the story "Will Bradley: His Chap Book" according to two metrics: Coherence and Fluency, on a scale from 1 to 5.

Let me first analyze the text for issues that affect Coherence and Fluency.

Coherence issues:
1. The story has a complex narrative structure with many chapters and sections, but some transitions between chapters feel abrupt.
2. Some chapters appear to be missing or incomplete, with the narrative jumping in places.
3. The story is written in a somewhat disjointed first-person/second-person voice that shifts inconsistently.
4. There are some logical inconsistencies and plot gaps that make the narrative progression feel less smooth.

Fluency issues:
1. There are numerous grammatical errors, including run-on sentences, missing punctuation, and incorrect word order.
2. Some sentences are incoherent or don't make grammatical sense (e.g., "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our").
3. There are many instances of awkward phrasing, word choice, and sentence structure.
4. Some passages appear to be missing words or have words in the wrong order.
5. The text has some typographical errors and inconsistent formatting.

Now let me assign scores based on these observations:

Coherence Score: 2
The story has a clear narrative about Will Bradley's life and career, but the structure is problematic with abrupt transitions and missing content. The inconsistent voice (shifting between first-person and second-person) further reduces coherence. The narrative has potential but is marred by structural issues.

Fluency Score: 2
The text has significant grammatical and syntactical issues that affect readability. There are numerous errors in sentence structure, punctuation, and word order that make the text difficult to follow in many places. While some passages are well-written, the overall fluency is significantly impacted by these issues.

Let me provide a detailed list of issues:

Issues:
- The narrative structure is disjointed with abrupt transitions between chapters and sections.
- Some chapters appear incomplete or missing, creating gaps in the story.
- The text shifts inconsistently between first-person and second-person narration.

- The text contains some run-on sentences and missing punctuation.
- There are instances of incorrect word order and awkward sentence construction.
- Some sections feel disconnected from the overall narrative arc.
- The story has a complex structure that is not always well-executed.

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested format.
