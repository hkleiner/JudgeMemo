I'll evaluate the given story according to the requested criteria of coherence and fluency.

First, I'll analyze the issues with the text:

For Coherence:
- The story has a clear central theme (identifying the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley), but the narrative structure is disjointed and lacks logical progression.
- There are numerous digressions and tangents that don't clearly connect to the main argument.
- The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions (geography, religious interpretation, historical claims).
- Some sections are repetitive or circular in their reasoning.
- The author frequently changes perspective and focus without warning.
- There are many unsupported claims and speculative statements presented as facts.
- The narrative lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end structure.

For Fluency:
- There are numerous grammatical errors and sentence fragments.
- Word choice is often awkward or inappropriate.
- There are many spelling errors (e.g., "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions").
- Punctuation is frequently incorrect or missing.
- Some sentences are overly complex and run on without proper breaks.
- There are numerous typos and formatting issues.
- The text contains many non-sequiturs and awkward phrasings.
- Some parts of the text appear to be written in reverse or jumbled.

Based on these observations:

Coherence Score: 2/5
The text has a central theme but lacks logical structure and clear progression. The narrative jumps between topics with few transitions and contains many digressions. The argument is not well-organized and often loses focus.

Fluency Score: 2/5
The text has significant issues with grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Word choice is often inappropriate, and sentence structure is frequently awkward or incorrect. Many sentences are difficult to parse due to these issues.

Now I'll format this according to the requested output format:
