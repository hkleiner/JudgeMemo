Alright, let me start by reading through the user's query and the story provided. The task is to rate the story's Coherence and Fluency on a scale of 1 to 5. I need to list the issues first and then assign the scores.

First, Coherence. The story is about identifying the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. The main points are the author's discovery, the geographical features matching biblical descriptions, and the location's characteristics. However, the flow is a bit disjointed. The author jumps between explaining the discovery process, geographical details, and historical references without clear transitions. There are also some abrupt shifts in ideas, like suddenly mentioning rattlesnakes without connecting it to the main narrative. The structure could be improved with better organization and logical sequencing.

For Fluency, I need to check grammar, syntax, and punctuation. The story has several errors. For example, "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" has a comma splice. There are instances of missing articles, like "the antldiluvians" (should be "the antediluvians"). Some sentences are run-on or awkwardly phrased, such as "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." Also, there are repeated phrases and unclear references, like "the thing" which appears multiple times without context. The use of "a stuff" and "the stuff" is confusing and needs correction. These issues affect the readability and flow of the text.

Now, considering the scores. Coherence: While the story has a central idea, the lack of smooth transitions and some abrupt jumps in logic might lower the score. However, the overall narrative is somewhat clear. I'd say a 3 for Coherence. Fluency: There are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, which would make the text harder to follow. A 2 for Fluency seems appropriate.

Issues:  
- Inconsistent and unclear references to "the thing" and "a stuff" throughout the text.  
- Frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "commencing more than half way up the mound").  
- Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it").  
- Disjointed structure with abrupt shifts between ideas and geographical descriptions.  
- Repetition of phrases (e.g., "the stuff") and lack of logical transitions between paragraphs.  
- Unclear or overly speculative connections between biblical references and the proposed location.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
