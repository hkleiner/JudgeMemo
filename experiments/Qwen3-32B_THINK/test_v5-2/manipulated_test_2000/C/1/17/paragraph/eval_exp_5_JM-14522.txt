I need to evaluate the given story according to two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Let me analyze the story first:

The story appears to be an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. It includes:
1. A prologue discussing Dickens and Edwin Drood
2. The introduction of the Otis family and their arrival at Canterville Chase
3. The legend of the Canterville ghost
4. The American family's interactions with the ghost

Now let me evaluate for Coherence and Fluency:

**Coherence Issues:**
1. Sudden shift in narrative style and content: The story begins with a typical ghost story narrative but then shifts to a discussion about Dickens and Edwin Drood, which seems out of place and unrelated to the main narrative.
2. Inconsistent narrative voice: The story alternates between a first-person narrative voice (the "I" that discusses Dickens) and a third-person omniscient narrator.
3. Confusing structure: The story seems to jump between different narrative threads - the Otis family's arrival at Canterville, the ghost story, and the Dickens/Edwin Drood discussion - without clear transitions.
4. Disjointed scenes: The scene in the London street with Stransom and Creston appears to be an unrelated story inserted into the main narrative, with no clear connection to the rest of the story.
5. Lack of clear progression: The narrative doesn't follow a clear beginning-middle-end structure, jumping between different scenes and ideas without clear connections.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. Awkward phrasing: There are several instances of awkward or unnatural phrasing, such as "I said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend's introduction."
2. Inconsistent tense: The narrative shifts between past and present tenses without clear reason.
3. Word choice: Some word choices seem odd or out of place in the context, such as "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England."
4. Punctuation issues: Some sentences have questionable punctuation or run-on sentences that make the text harder to follow.
5. Sentence structure: Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, making them difficult to understand.

Based on my analysis:

**Coherence Score:**
A 3 - The story has a clear ghost story narrative at its core, but the narrative is disrupted by unrelated passages and shifts in voice. The core story is coherent, but the overall structure and flow are confusing.

**Fluency Score:**
A 4 - The text is generally well-written with few major grammatical errors. The language flows reasonably well, though there are some awkward phrasings and occasional inconsistencies in tense and word choice.

Let me write my evaluation with specific issues identified:
