Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to evaluate a story based on coherence and fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to read through the provided story carefully to identify any issues that affect these two criteria.

Starting with fluency. I'll look for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The story has some typos, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions." There are also some awkward phrasings, such as "have ventured to publish it" which is missing a subject. The sentence structure is sometimes convoluted, making it hard to follow. For example, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The lack of a subject here is a grammar issue. Also, "admirirg" is a typo for "admir[ing]." These errors would lower the fluency score.

Now, coherence. The story jumps between different narratives and ideas without clear transitions. The main text discusses the Garden of Eden in America, but then there's a sudden shift to a story about Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin, which seems unrelated. Later, there's another shift to a different narrative involving Mrs. Umney and Canterville Chase, which is reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost." These abrupt changes in narrative make the story incoherent. The structure is all over the place, with no clear progression. The author also introduces new ideas without connecting them to the previous content, making it hard to follow the main argument or story. The final section about the Life Assurance Office and George Stransom adds another unrelated narrative thread. These disjointed sections would significantly impact the coherence score.

For the final scores, considering the fluency issues: multiple typos, awkward phrasing, and missing subjects. I'd say the fluency is around 2. Coherence is worse because of the multiple unrelated narratives and lack of structure. I'd rate coherence as 1.5, but since the scale is integers, I'll round it to 2. Wait, the user might prefer to round up if it's close. But given the severe issues with coherence, maybe a 2 is too high. Let me check again. The story has multiple distinct narratives with no clear connection, making it very incoherent. So a 1 might be more accurate for coherence. However, the main part about the Garden of Eden is somewhat coherent on its own, but the shifts to other stories disrupt it. Maybe a 2 for coherence. Fluency has some issues but is not as severe as coherence. So fluency 2, coherence 2.

Issues:  
- Inconsistent narrative structure with abrupt shifts between unrelated stories (e.g., the Garden of Eden, Jasper/Rosa subplot, Canterville Chase, and the Life Assurance Office).  
- Typos and grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "admirirg," missing subjects in sentences).  
- Awkward phrasing and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it").  
- Lack of logical progression and coherence between sections; disjointed transitions between topics.  
- Unclear connections between the main argument (Garden of Eden in America) and inserted subplots.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
