Alright, let's tackle this task. First, I need to understand the user's instructions thoroughly. They want me to evaluate a human-written story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The output should list the issues in bullet points under "Issues:" and then assign the scores for each metric.

Looking at the Evaluation Criterion, Coherence is about the overall structure of the story—logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth transitions, and a clear narrative. Fluency focuses on individual sentences, checking for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation.

Now, I'll read the provided story. The story is a critical analysis of Dickens's "Edwin Drood," discussing its plot and characters. The text is quite dense with literary analysis and references. Let's break it down.

Starting with Fluency: I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues. The story uses complex sentences, which is common in academic writing. I notice some instances where commas might be missing or overused, but I'm not sure if they're errors. For example, in the sentence "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" The quotation marks and parentheses are used correctly. There's a mix of italics and underscores for book titles, which might be inconsistent but is probably intentional for emphasis or formatting.

Another example: "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises." This is a well-structured sentence. However, some sentences are quite long, which could affect readability but not necessarily fluency. I don't see obvious grammatical errors, so Fluency might be high, but I need to check for any issues that might hinder smooth reading.

Now, Coherence: The story transitions from discussing Dickens's writing style to a specific analysis of "Edwin Drood," introducing characters and plot points. The flow is logical, but there are some abrupt shifts. For instance, the story starts with a literary analysis, then jumps into a narrative about Stransom and Mary Antrim, which seems out of place. This might confuse the reader about the main focus. The introduction of characters like Stransom and the jeweller's shop seems disconnected from the main topic of Dickens's plot. 

Additionally, the story mentions "Mr. Sampson" and "Mr. William Archer" in the middle, which could be confusing. The text also has some inconsistencies in character names (e.g., Sapsea vs. Sapsea vs. Sapsea, which is consistent, but Durdles is introduced without prior context). The shift from discussing Dickens to a fictional narrative within the analysis might disrupt the coherence. The story also mentions "Lord Canterville" in a sentence that seems out of context, possibly a misplaced quote or a reference to another story (like "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde), which is confusing here.

Another point is the use of italics and underscores for book titles, which might be inconsistent. The story also has some run-on sentences and complex structures that could make the narrative feel cluttered. The mention of "The Signalman" in "Mugby Junction" is a correct reference but might need more context for clarity.

Putting it all together, for Fluency: The text is mostly well-structured with few grammatical errors. However, some sentences are overly complex and could be improved for clarity. The punctuation and formatting are mostly correct. I might give a high score here, maybe a 4 or 5.

For Coherence: The story has logical sections but some abrupt transitions and disconnected elements. The introduction of the Stransom narrative and the Lord Canterville mention disrupt the flow. The analysis of "Edwin Drood" is clear, but the surrounding content is less cohesive. This might lead to a mid-range score, perhaps a 3 or 4.

Wait, the user mentioned that the story is a critical analysis. The main text seems to be a scholarly article analyzing Dickens's work, but there are narrative sections that might be part of the analysis (like Stransom's story). However, the sudden shift to a quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts is confusing and not related to the main topic. This affects coherence. Also, the structure moves from introduction to the story of Edwin Drood, but there are interjections that don't flow smoothly. The coherence score might be lower because of these disruptions.

So, finalizing the scores: Fluency is 4 because the text is mostly well-written with minor issues. Coherence is 3 because there are logical sections but some disjointed elements and abrupt transitions.

Issues: 
- Sudden shift from literary analysis to a narrative involving Stransom and Mary Antrim without clear connection to the main topic.
- Disjointed introduction of "Lord Canterville" and the ghost quote, which appears unrelated to Dickens’s *Edwin Drood*.
- Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., moving from character descriptions to a crypt scene with Sapsea and Durdles).
- Confusing references to "Mr. Sampson" and "Mr. William Archer" without contextual clarity.
- Overly complex sentences and run-ons that hinder readability (e.g., long descriptions of Jasper’s opium use).
- Inconsistent formatting (mix of italics and underscores for book titles).

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
