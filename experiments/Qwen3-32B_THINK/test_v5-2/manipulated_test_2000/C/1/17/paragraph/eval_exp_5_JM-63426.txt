Okay, let's start by looking at the story provided. The user wants me to evaluate it based on Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. I need to list the issues first, then assign the scores.

First, for Fluency. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me read through the story carefully.

The introduction part seems okay, but there are some awkward phrases. For example, "With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens’s last plot." That feels a bit out of place because the story is about Will Bradley, not Dickens. Also, the transition from talking about Dickens to the next paragraph is abrupt. 

Then, in the chapter "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING," there's a sudden shift to a different narrative about Sir Simon and the Chase. The sentence "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances..." doesn't connect to the rest of the story. This seems like a non-sequitur or a misplaced paragraph. That's a problem for both fluency and coherence.

Looking at grammar and punctuation: "The two jobbers are kicked." That sentence is unclear. What's being kicked? Maybe it's a typo or missing words. Also, "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The dash is okay, but maybe a colon would be better for clarity.

Now, for Coherence. The story jumps between different narratives without clear transitions. The introduction talks about Will Bradley's impact on graphic arts, then suddenly shifts to a scene involving Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston. This scene doesn't seem to relate to Bradley's story, which breaks the logical flow. Then, after that, it goes into the boyhood of Bradley in Ishpeming. The inclusion of the Sir Simon paragraph is another disjointed element. These abrupt shifts and unrelated segments make the story incoherent.

Also, the ending of the introduction mentions Stransom and Creston but doesn't resolve the tension or explain how it relates to Bradley. The transition to the boy printer chapter is jarring without any explanation. The story lacks a clear progression and connects ideas that don't logically follow each other.

So, for Fluency issues: awkward transitions, some unclear sentences, possible typos or missing words. For Coherence: disjointed narratives, abrupt shifts, unrelated paragraphs. 

Assigning scores. Fluency: There are some issues but the overall language is mostly clear. Maybe a 3. Coherence: The story has significant problems with logical flow and structure. Maybe a 2. But I need to check again.

Wait, the introduction starts with talking about Bradley, then shifts to analyzing Dickens's plot, which is confusing. Then the Stransom scene, then back to Bradley's boyhood. The Sir Simon paragraph is completely out of place. These are major coherence issues. Maybe lower the coherence score to 2. Fluency has some minor issues but not too bad, so 3.

Issues:  
- Abrupt transition from introducing Will Bradley to analyzing Dickens's plot without connection.  
- Disjointed narrative shift to unrelated characters (Stransom, Mary Antrim, Paul Creston) without context or relevance to Bradley.  
- Sudden insertion of unrelated paragraph about Sir Simon and the Chase in the middle of Bradley’s biography.  
- Awkward phrasing and unclear sentences (e.g., "The two jobbers are kicked," "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week").  
- Inconsistent tone and structure between the analytical introduction and the biographical narrative.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
