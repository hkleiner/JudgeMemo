Let me analyze this story according to the two evaluation criteria: Coherence and Fluency.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. Inconsistent narrative structure: The story jumps between different narrative styles - sometimes it reads like a first-person account of discovery, sometimes it reads like a travel guide, and sometimes it has a more academic tone.

2. Unclear connections between ideas: The author makes many claims about this location being the Garden of Eden but often doesn't clearly explain how the evidence supports these claims.

3. Disjointed flow: The text frequently shifts between describing the landscape, making theological arguments, and recounting historical information without clear transitions.

4. Unclear references: The text references "antldiluvians" (likely a misspelling of "antediluvians"), "Euphrates," and other terms without sufficient explanation for a general reader.

5. Missing information: The story ends abruptly mid-sentence with "Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful flourishing city of La Crosse... coming in from" without completing the thought.

6. Confusing organization: The author presents multiple arguments and descriptions without a clear progression or logical sequence.

7. Unclear purpose: It's difficult to determine what the author's main point is - is it primarily a geographical description, a theological argument, or a historical account?

**Fluency Issues:**

1. Numerous spelling errors: "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "jageed" (should be "jagged"), "Bridtish" (should be "British").

2. Grammar issues: "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject pronoun. "And this hanging garden has been notable and notorious for rattlesnakes" is awkwardly phrased. "Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names" is unclear.

3. Awkward phrasing: "By degrees it has been opening to the minds of some" is awkward. "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity" has incorrect punctuation. "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have discovered them" is unnecessarily wordy.

4. Inconsistent verb tense usage: The text shifts between past and present tense without clear transitions.

5. Word choice issues: "A smart pen recorded each word" is unclear. "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" seems out of place. "The fabled dog" is an unclear reference.

6. Punctuation problems: Missing or incorrect commas, missing periods, and awkward sentence structures throughout the text.

7. Run-on sentences: Many sentences are excessively long and difficult to follow.

**Scoring:**

For Coherence:
The text has a clear central theme (identifying a location as the Garden of Eden), but the narrative is disorganized with abrupt shifts in perspective and tone. The connections between ideas are often unclear, and the text lacks a logical progression. The abrupt ending mid-sentence is particularly problematic. I would rate this as a 2 on a 5-point scale.

For Fluency:
The text contains numerous spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors that significantly affect readability. The awkward phrasing and word choice make it difficult to follow the author's points. The text would require significant editing to be considered fluent. I would rate this as a 2 on a 5-point scale.

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested format:
