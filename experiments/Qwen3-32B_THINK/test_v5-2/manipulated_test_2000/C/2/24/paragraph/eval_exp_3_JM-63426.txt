Okay, let's start by understanding the task. The user wants me to evaluate a story based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. I need to list the issues under each category and then assign scores. 

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of the content. The story is about Will Bradley and his contributions to American graphic arts. It's divided into two chapters: an introduction and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." 

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me scan the text. 

In the first chapter, the sentence structure seems okay, but there are some awkward phrasings. For example, "The home assistant played ambient music." That seems out of place here, maybe a typo or misplaced sentence. Another part: "The energy grid remained balanced." That also feels inserted without context. These might be errors affecting fluency. Also, some sentences are run-on or have missing punctuation. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House..." The transition is abrupt. 

Looking at the second chapter, the narrative is more story-like, but there are inconsistencies in tense and some missing punctuation. For instance, "You are six years old; next month you will be seven." The semicolon here is correct, but the flow is choppy. Also, "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." These sentences are short and disconnected. 

Now for Coherence. The story should have a logical sequence, smooth transitions, and a clear progression. The first chapter introduces Bradley's impact but jumps to historical context without clear transitions. The second chapter is a narrative of his early life, which is coherent on its own but the connection between the two chapters isn't clear. The story ends abruptly in the second chapter with Mr. Newett's actions, leaving the reader hanging. Also, there are some plot holes or missing explanations, like the mention of the "Narrow Gauge" without context. Additionally, the story includes some anachronistic elements like "The home assistant played ambient music" and "A livestream began recording," which don't fit the 19th-century setting, disrupting the narrative flow.

Putting this all together, the fluency issues include awkward phrasing, misplaced sentences, and inconsistent punctuation. Coherence problems involve abrupt transitions, missing context, anachronisms, and an incomplete ending. 

For the scores, considering the fluency issues, maybe a 3. It's readable but has several errors. Coherence is lower because of the structural issues and anachronisms, so maybe a 2.

Issues: (write a feedback for criteria)  
- Fluency: Awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "The home assistant played ambient music" and "A livestream began recording" are anachronistic and disrupt flow). Some run-on sentences and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing commas in lists, abrupt transitions between clauses).  
- Coherence: Abrupt shifts between historical context and personal narrative without clear transitions. Anachronistic elements (e.g., modern tech references) disrupt narrative consistency. The story ends mid-sentence in the second chapter, leaving unresolved threads. Some plot holes (e.g., unclear context for "Narrow Gauge" or the sudden focus on Mr. Newett’s actions).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
