Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The user provided a detailed story and wants me to list the issues in bullet points and then assign scores.

First, I'll start by understanding what each criterion means. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and avoiding ambiguities. Fluency is about the quality of individual sentences: grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc.

Looking at the story, I notice it's an introduction and a chapter about Will Bradley. The first chapter is an introduction, and the second is "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." Let me read through both to identify issues.

Starting with Fluency:

- The first paragraph mentions "It shoulded be talked about" – "shoulded" is incorrect; it should be "should be."
- "hard to realized" should be "hard to realize."
- "Morris failing to revived medievalism" – "revived" should be "revive."
- "Toulouse-Lautrec spread modern art" – "spread" might be "spreading" or "spread" as in past tense, but the context is past, so maybe correct.
- "barriers being demolish everywhere" – "demolish" should be "demolished."
- "am know to a few connoisseurs" – "am" should be "are."
- "he may had had" – "may had had" is incorrect; should be "may have had."
- "it don’t worked" – "don’t" should be "didn’t," and "worked" might be "work" if using past tense.
- "thrill him to spoke" – "spoke" should be "speak."
- "appeal to him more than any exquisite backwater" – maybe "appealed" or "appeals" depending on tense.
