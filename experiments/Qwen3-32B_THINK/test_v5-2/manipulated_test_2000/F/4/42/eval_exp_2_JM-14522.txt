Alright, I'm given a story excerpt and need to evaluate it based on two criteria: coherence and fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, I'll read through the story to understand the content and identify any issues with coherence and fluency.

Coherence refers to how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logical sequencing, smooth transitions between ideas, and a clear narrative structure. Issues that would reduce coherence include plot holes, confusing jumps in the story, or inconsistencies.

Fluency refers to the smoothness and correctness of the language at the sentence level. Issues that would reduce fluency include grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, incorrect word choices, or punctuation problems.

Now I'll analyze the story for these issues.

Issues with Coherence:
1. The story is a ghost story with a clear narrative structure, following the Otis family's experiences at Canterville Chase.
2. There is a logical progression from the purchase of the house to the family's arrival and their encounters with the ghost.
3. The story maintains a consistent tone and setting throughout.
4. The character interactions and reactions to the ghost are consistent with their established personalities.
5. The narrative doesn't have major plot holes or confusing elements.

Issues with Fluency:
1. There are numerous grammatical errors:
   - "every one tell him" should be "every one told him"
   - "when they come to discuss terms" should be "when they came to discuss terms"
   - "she never really recover" should be "she never really recovered"
   - "the ghost has am see" should be "the ghost has been seen"
   - "we'dded have it" should be "we'd have had it"
   - "I felt bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has am see by several living members"
   - "It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always made its appearance"
   - "I guess the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended"
   - "who do not quite understood"
   - "he never ceased to regretted"
   - "qualified himself for American diplomacy by led the German"
   - "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses"
   - "was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes."
   - "had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length and a half"
   - "is sent back to Eton that very night"
   - "The Star and Stripes, as they am always getting swished"
   - "Mr. Otis have telegraphed"
   - "the sky became suddenly overcast"
   - "a curious stillness seem to hold the atmosphere"
   - "before they reach the house"
   - "some big drops of rain have fallen"
   - "reply the old housekeeper"
   - "blood had am spilt"
   - "It must was removed"
   - "answer in the same low, mysterious voice"
   - "have fallen upon his knees"
   - "could was seen"
   - "woulded did it"
   - "have said these words"
   - "light up the sombre room"
   - "made them all started to their feet"
   - "she woedn't fainted"
   - "There was no doubt, however, that she is extremely upset"
   - "to bewared of some trouble came"
   - "say, that would make"
   - "had not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here"
   - "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred"
   - "they find the terrible stain of blood once again"
   - "the library have been lock up"
   - "the whole family were now quite interested"
   - "Mr. Otis began to suspect that he have been too dogmatic"
   - "the objective existence of phantasmata am removed"
   - "I have since learn from Mr. Otis"
   - "the conversation in no way turned upon ghosts"
   - "He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at the time."
   - "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which is not at all feverish."
   - "He put on his slippers, take a small oblong phial"
   - "He shall left it here for you"
   - "retire to rest"
   - "The Canterville ghost stand quite motionless"
   - "he fled down the corridor, uttered hollow groans, and emitted a ghastly green light"
   - "a door is flung open"

2. There are many punctuation errors and awkward phrasing issues.
3. The story has a consistent narrative flow and structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
4. The story maintains a consistent tone and setting throughout.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the story as follows:
- Coherence: 4/5 - The story has a clear narrative structure with logical sequencing of events, but the numerous grammatical and punctuation errors distract from the overall reading experience.
- Fluency: 2/5 - The story contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb forms, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact the readability.

Let me double-check my analysis to ensure I haven't missed anything important.

The story is clearly written with a narrative arc, but the numerous grammatical errors significantly impact the fluency. The coherence is good despite the language issues because the narrative structure is clear and the events follow logically from one to the next.

I believe my ratings are accurate based on the criteria provided.
