Alright, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a 1-5 scale. First, I need to understand what each criterion means. Coherence is about the overall structure and logical flow of the story, making sure ideas are connected and the narrative makes sense. Fluency is about the smoothness of the languageâ€”grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc.

Looking at the story, it's a long, detailed text about the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the US. The author uses a lot of biblical references and geographical descriptions. 

Starting with Coherence: The story jumps between different ideas and descriptions without clear transitions. For example, the author talks about the Garden of Eden in the context of the Bible, then shifts to describing the geographical features of the Mississippi River area. The connections between these parts aren't always clear. There's also repetition of ideas, like the location in the "North West" and the specific cities mentioned. The narrative structure is a bit all over the place, making it hard to follow the main argument. The author also introduces concepts like the Hanging Garden and the presence of snakes (rattlesnakes) without a smooth transition. The ending seems abrupt, and the overall flow doesn't build up logically from one point to the next. The story lacks a clear progression, which affects coherence.

For Fluency: There are several grammatical errors. For example, "had venture to published it" should be "had ventured to publish it." The tense is incorrect here. Another example is "It should was sought" which should be "It should be sought." There are also run-on sentences and awkward phrasing, like "But by degrees it has am opening to the minds of some." The word "am" doesn't fit here. Spelling mistakes like "admirirg" instead of "admiring" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions" are present. The use of hyphens and commas is inconsistent, leading to confusion. The author also uses some archaic or incorrect verb forms, such as "was being settled and inhabit" instead of "was being settled and inhabited." The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it hard to follow the meaning. The punctuation is sometimes missing or misplaced, which affects readability. The use of em dashes and other punctuation is inconsistent, which can disrupt the flow.

Putting this all together, the Coherence score would be low because the narrative lacks logical progression and clear connections. The Fluency score is also low due to numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The author's enthusiasm for the topic might have led to a lack of careful editing, resulting in a text that's hard to follow and riddled with mistakes.

Issues:  
- Inconsistent and fragmented narrative structure with abrupt shifts between ideas.  
- Repetitive references to the Garden of Eden and its supposed location without clear progression.  
- Ambiguous connections between biblical interpretations and geographical descriptions.  
- Overuse of archaic or incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "had venture to published," "shoulded be").  
- Grammatical errors (e.g., "It should was sought," "admirirg," "dimentions").  
- Run-on sentences and awkward phrasing (e.g., "But by degrees it has am opening to the minds of some").  
- Inconsistent punctuation and missing commas/periods disrupting flow.  
- Confusing capitalization of non-proper nouns (e.g., "Father of Waters," "Laughing").  
- Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and sections.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
