Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The task is to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The story provided is an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. 

First, I need to understand what Coherence and Fluency mean in this context. 

**Coherence** refers to how well the story flows as a whole. It's about logical sequencing of ideas, smooth transitions between sections, and avoiding ambiguities or abrupt jumps. A coherent story should have a clear narrative structure where each part connects logically to the next.

**Fluency** is about the readability of individual sentences. It focuses on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. A fluent text should be free from awkward phrasing, errors, and should read smoothly.

Now, I'll read through the story and note any issues that might affect Coherence and Fluency.

### Issues for Coherence:
1. **Logical Sequencing**: The story is a chapter from a longer narrative. It introduces characters and a ghostly presence, but it's unclear how the events connect to the broader story. However, since it's an excerpt, some context is missing, which is normal. The flow within the excerpt seems logical, moving from the Otis family's arrival to the appearance of the ghost.
2. **Smooth Transitions**: The transitions between scenes are generally smooth. The story moves from the family's arrival, their interaction with the housekeeper, the recurring blood stain, and the ghost's first appearance. The narrative progresses without abrupt jumps.
3. **Ambiguities or Unresolved Elements**: There are some elements that might be ambiguous if the reader is not familiar with the original story (like the history of the Canterville Chase and the ghost). However, the excerpt provides enough context to follow the events, so it's not a major issue.
4. **Character Consistency**: The characters' actions and reactions are consistent within the scene. Mr. Otis's pragmatic approach and the family's reactions are consistent with their personalities as established in the story.

### Issues for Fluency:
1. **Spelling Errors**: There are several spelling mistakes in the text. For example, "seej by several living members of my family" (should be "seen"), "as wdll as bu tye rector" (should be "as well as by the rector"), "ofteb got very little sleep" (should be "often got"), "A fsw weeks afger this" (should be "A few weeks after this"), "finebfreedom" (should be "fine freedom"), "xnd" (should be "and"), "waw" (should be "was"), "guarfians" (should be "guardians"), "xven" (should be "seven"), "withvthe scent" (should be "with the scent"), "tuey reavhed" (should be "they reached"), "Standint" (should be "Standing"), "Lady Canterville'x" (should be "Lady Canterville's"), "Shr made" (should be "She made"), "Yhe storm" (should be "The storm"), "evwrything" (should be "everything"), "librwry" (should be "library"), "up-staies" (should be "upstairs"), "Myerw and Podmore" (should be "Myers and Podmore"), "rhe sound of footsteps" (should be "the sound of footsteps"), "obpong phial" (should be "opaque phial"), "Unoted States" (should be "United States"), and "anmold man" (should be "an old man").
2. **Punctuation Errors**: Some sentences have missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, "I fear that the ghost exists," said Lord Canterville, "though it may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It has been well known for three centuries, simce 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family." The comma after "centuries" should be a semicolon or a period for clarity. Also, some sentences are run-ons or lack necessary commas.
3. **Awkward Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkward or unclear. For example, "I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody." The phrasing is a bit forced and unnatural. Another example is "I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more, should you require it." The structure is a bit convoluted.
4. **Word Choice**: Some word choices are either incorrect or not in line with standard English usage. For example, "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." The phrase "of opinion" is less common and sounds awkward. It would be better as "I have always been of the opinion that..."

### Scoring:
**Coherence**: The story maintains a logical flow and smooth transitions between scenes. Despite being an excerpt, the narrative is clear and the events are presented in a logical sequence. The characters' actions and the progression of the ghost's appearance are well-connected. The only minor issue is the lack of context for readers unfamiliar with the original story, but this is inherent to the excerpt format. Therefore, the Coherence score is high.

**Fluency**: There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors that affect readability. The text contains several misspelled words, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues. These errors would distract a reader and make the text less fluent. While the overall meaning is understandable, the frequent errors reduce the fluency score. Therefore, the Fluency score is lower due to these issues.

Based on the evaluation criteria, the final scores would be:

- **Coherence Score**: 5 (The story is logically structured with smooth transitions and clear progression.)
- **Fluency Score**: 2 (The text has numerous spelling, punctuation, and phrasing errors that hinder readability.)

Now, I'll format the answer according to the specified output format.

Issues: 
- Spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "seej", "wdll", "afger", "xven", "waw", "guarfians").
- Punctuation errors and missing commas in sentences (e.g., run-on sentences, incorrect use of semicolons).
- Awkward phrasing and unnatural word choices (e.g., "I have always been of opinion", "I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles").
- Minor inconsistencies in narrative flow due to being an excerpt with missing context.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
