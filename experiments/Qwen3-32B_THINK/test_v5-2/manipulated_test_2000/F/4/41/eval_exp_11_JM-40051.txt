Alright, let me read and analyze this story to assess its fluency and coherence. 

**Fluency Assessment:**
Fluency focuses on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll look for any errors or awkward phrasing.

- The text contains numerous spelling errors, such as "antldiluvians", "princopak", "locayion", "cohsequently", "thr", "prlper dimentions", "acclimate", "plafe", "investigatikn", "antideluvians", "ingenuoty", "Bridtish", "thjs vast aeea", "innabited", "thr", "consitutes", "throughmwhich", "hightest", "dor", "ignotance", "eere", "scwttered", "jt", "around thjs", "beyondndescription", "wall if the garden", "Ligerally", "andcdistinct", "gardrn", "wlmost", "endkess".
- There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as "have ventured to publish it", "he simply stated the princopak facts", "the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family", "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it", "the finger of time has been plainly pointing", "the discovery, resulted from my familiarity with", "I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion", "I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my friends", "and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with the results", "and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory investigatikn".
- Some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation, making them difficult to follow.
- The text includes some awkward word choices and phrasing that make it less fluent.

**Coherence Assessment:**
Coherence focuses on the logical flow of the story, how ideas are connected, and whether the narrative progresses smoothly without ambiguities or abrupt jumps.

- The story attempts to make a case for the Garden of Eden being located in a specific area in the United States.
- The narrative jumps between different ideas and arguments without clear transitions.
- The author provides various justifications for why this location fits the biblical description of Eden, but the connections between these points are not always logical or well-explained.
- The story includes a mix of historical, geographical, and religious references that are not always clearly connected.
- There are some abrupt shifts in the narrative, such as from discussing the Garden of Eden to describing specific locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota.
- The text lacks a clear structure or progression of ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.

Based on my assessment:

**Fluency Score:** 2/5
The text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and run-on sentences that significantly impact its fluency. The language is often difficult to read and understand due to these issues.

**Coherence Score:** 2/5
The narrative lacks a clear logical progression, with ideas jumping between different topics without proper transitions. The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly structured, and the connections between different points are often unclear or abrupt.

Let me double-check my assessment to make sure I'm not missing anything:

**Fluency Issues:**
- The text contains many spelling errors that make it difficult to read.
- There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout.
- Some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation.
- The language is often awkward and unsmooth.

**Coherence Issues:**
- The narrative jumps between different ideas without clear transitions.
- The author's argument is not clearly structured or logically presented.
- There are abrupt shifts in the narrative that make it difficult to follow.
- The connections between different points are often unclear or forced.

My assessment stands:
**Fluency Score: 2/5**
**Coherence Score: 2/5**

Actually, let me revise my assessment slightly. The text is quite long and contains many ideas, so it's challenging to assess every sentence. Let me focus on the most significant issues:

**Fluency Score:** 2/5
The text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that significantly impact its fluency. The language is often awkward and difficult to read due to these issues.

**Coherence Score:** 2/5
The narrative lacks a clear logical progression, with ideas jumping between different topics without proper transitions. The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly structured, and the connections between different points are often unclear or abrupt.

My final assessment remains the same.
