Alright, let me start by reading through the user's query and the provided story carefully. The task is to evaluate the story's Coherence and Fluency on a scale of 1 to 5. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure the response, so I need to make sure I follow that exactly.

First, I'll need to assess the Fluency. Fluency focuses on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I should look for any errors in these areas. The story is quite long, so I'll need to scan through it for any obvious mistakes.

Looking at the first chapter, I notice some typos: "seem" is misspelled as "seem" (probably a typo for "seen"), "toom" instead of "room", "Yelpow Book" might be "Yellow Book", "avant garde galaxy" seems a bit awkward, "werenbknown" should be "were not known", "cderivative" is likely "derivative" with an extra 'c', "there werecderivative" has an extra 'c', "emriched" should be "enriched", "omey" instead of "memory", "coveref" instead of "covered", "ismsitting" should be "is sitting", "wre" instead of "are", "rethrn" instead of "return", "cemts" instead of "cents", "prrss" instead of "press", "eay" instead of "every", "shen" instead of "when", "qant" instead of "want", "Youngo" instead of "Young go", "lirtle" instead of "little", "toing" instead of "going", "Bkston" instead of "Boston", "wzit" instead of "wait", "c" in various places seems to be an extra character, like in "backwater.cTeacher", "esucation" instead of "education", "freauently" instead of "frequently", "prdss" instead of "press", "boardcand" instead of "board and", "advance isbalways" instead of "advance is always", etc. These are quite a few spelling and punctuation errors. There are also some awkward phrases and non-standard word choices, like "romped like a breeze through American graphic arts", which is a bit unusual but maybe intentional. The overall fluency is affected by these errors, making the text harder to read smoothly.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow of the story, how ideas are connected, and the structure. The first chapter is an introduction about Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, referencing historical figures and movements. The second chapter is a fictionalized account of Bradley's childhood and early career. The two chapters are distinct but related thematically. However, the transition between the introduction and the story of Bradley's early life is abrupt. The first chapter is more analytical and historical, while the second is a narrative. The reader might find the shift jarring. Additionally, within the second chapter, the narrative flows well, with a chronological progression from Bradley's childhood to his early career. However, there are some inconsistencies in the timeline and details that might confuse the reader. For example, the timeline mentions "1875" and then "In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through. Your uncle and aunt go for a visit 'back East.' Your mother keeps house for your cousins." The timeline isn't always clear, which might affect coherence. Also, the introduction doesn't clearly set up the transition to the second chapter, making the story feel a bit disjointed.

Now, considering the evaluation criteria:

Fluency: The numerous spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, and awkward phrasing would lower the fluency score. The text is readable but has many errors that disrupt the flow.

Coherence: The story has a clear narrative in the second chapter, but the transition from the introduction to the narrative is abrupt. The structure is somewhat disjointed, and the timeline in the second chapter has some inconsistencies, which affects the overall coherence.

Based on these observations, I would rate Fluency as 2 out of 5 because of the many errors that make the text difficult to read smoothly. Coherence is a bit better, but the abrupt transition and some inconsistencies in the narrative would lead to a score of 3 out of 5.

Issues:  
- Numerous spelling errors (e.g., "seem" → "seen," "toom" → "room," "Yelpow" → "Yellow," "werenbknown" → "were not known," "emriched" → "enriched").  
- Punctuation and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., missing apostrophes, extra characters like "c" in "cderivative," inconsistent capitalization).  
- Awkward phrasing and non-standard word choices (e.g., "romped like a breeze," "avant garde galaxy").  
- Abrupt transition between the analytical introduction and the fictionalized narrative in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming."  
- Timeline inconsistencies and unclear connections in the second chapter (e.g., unclear shifts in time, disjointed events).  
- Missing or fragmented sentences (e.g., "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget. Then he sends you out to play. Youngo to Fisherman’s Beach...").  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
