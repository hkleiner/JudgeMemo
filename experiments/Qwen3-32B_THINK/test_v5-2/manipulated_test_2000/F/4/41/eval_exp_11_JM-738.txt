Let me analyze this story according to the evaluation criteria for coherence and fluency.

First, I'll review the content to understand what the story is about:
- This appears to be an analytical essay about Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"
- It discusses Dickens's writing style in his later works, particularly focusing on construction and plot
- The essay analyzes the characters and plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"
- It references various critics and theories about the novel's unresolved mystery
- The text includes a detailed description of the story's opening and some characters

Now, I'll evaluate the text for coherence and fluency according to the criteria provided.

For Coherence (how the story unfolds as a whole):
- The text is actually more of an analytical essay about a novel rather than a story in itself
- The structure is somewhat coherent as it follows a logical progression from general discussion of Dickens's writing to specific analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"
- There is a clear introduction, body with character analysis, and some narrative elements
- However, the text jumps between analytical discussion and narrative description
- The narrative sections (like the opening of the tale) are coherent on their own
- The text maintains a consistent focus on analyzing Dickens's novel
- There are some transitions between sections, but they could be smoother
- The text includes some references that may be confusing without context (e.g., "Peveril," "Watched by the Dead," etc.)

For Fluency (how the text reads from start to finish):
- There are numerous spelling errors and typos: "assiduously cultivated", "absolutsly", "deserfed", "ajd", "romam policier", "apopldxy", "seuzures", "notvout", "atmosphers", "x lack", "kpium", "fromcthe life", "conceaoed", "there arectwo", "thebsupernormal"
- There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout
- The text uses archaic or old-fashioned language that might be less fluent to modern readers
- Punctuation is generally correct, but there are some inconsistencies
- The sentence structure is often complex and could be clearer
- The text uses many literary and specialized terms that might be less fluent for general readers
- The flow between analytical sections and narrative descriptions is sometimes abrupt

Based on these observations, I'll identify specific issues for each metric:

Coherence Issues:
- The text is primarily an analytical essay rather than a story, which may affect how it's perceived as a narrative
- There are some abrupt transitions between analytical sections and narrative descriptions
- Some references to other works and critics may be confusing without context
- The text includes some narrative elements that are coherent on their own but may not fully integrate with the analytical sections
- The structure is generally logical but could be more smoothly connected

Fluency Issues:
- Numerous spelling errors throughout the text
- Several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing
- Use of archaic or old-fashioned language that may be less fluent for modern readers
- Complex sentence structures that could be clearer
- Inconsistent formatting of book and character names
- Some punctuation issues
- The text uses many specialized literary terms that may be less accessible to general readers

Now I'll assign scores based on these observations:

For Coherence:
Given that this is primarily an analytical essay about a novel rather than a story in itself, and while it has a logical structure, the integration of analytical content with narrative elements is somewhat disjointed. I would rate this a 3 for coherence - it's generally logical and structured, but the integration of different elements is not fully seamless.

For Fluency:
The text has numerous spelling errors, grammatical issues, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. The archaic language and complex sentence structures also make it less fluent. I would rate this a 2 for fluency - it's understandable but has significant issues with spelling, grammar, and readability.

Let me finalize my assessment with specific issues:

Issues:
- Numerous spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "absolutsly", "deserfed", "ajd", "apopldxy", "seuzures", "atmosphers", "x lack", "kpium", "fromcthe life", "conceaoed", "thebsupernormal")
- Grammatical errors and awkward phrasing
- Archaic or old-fashioned language that may be less fluent for modern readers
- Complex sentence structures that could be clearer
- Inconsistent formatting of book and character names
- Some punctuation issues
- The text is primarily an analytical essay rather than a story, which may affect narrative flow
- Some abrupt transitions between analytical sections and narrative descriptions
- References to other works and critics that may be confusing without context
- The integration of analytical content with narrative elements is somewhat disjointed

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
