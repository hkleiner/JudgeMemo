Alright, let me analyze the provided story text according to the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency.

### Fluency Issues:
1. Spelling errors: "best-establisjed" (should be "best-established"), "unvommon" (should be "uncommon"), "confidenve" (should be "confidence"), "doctrime" (should be "doctrine"), "groundworknof" (should be "groundwork of"), "srrvice" (should be "service"), "RealnPresence" (should be "Real Presence"), "investigatemin" (should be "investigate in"), "blessed Saviour" (should be "blessed Saviour"), "prssent" (should be "present"), "vby" (should be "by"), "Rome teaches thatvby" (should be "Rome teaches that by"), "wnd" (should be "and"), "Daviour" (should be "Saviour"), "witbout" (should be "without"), "sectwo" (should be "the two"), "call forth" (should be "call forth"), "collateral writeds" (should be "collateral writings"), "tp" (should be "to"), "invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our faith in Him." (awkward phrasing), "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." (awkward phrasing).

2. Grammar issues: "It is not at all an unvommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidenve that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England" (awkward sentence structure), "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." (awkward phrasing), "The issues st stake are far too serious" (missing "at" - should be "The issues at stake are far too serious"), "now that after three hundred years of faithful srrvice the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced" (awkward phrasing), "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapternof St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper" (awkward phrasing).

3. Punctuation issues: "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-" (awkward title formatting), "1 Vor. x. 16, 17" (unclear reference format), "Thus it is not at all an unvommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidenve that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England" (awkward punctuation), "But, I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging tue three principal points at issue under the three heads of the RealnPresence, Adoration, and Sacrifice" (awkward punctuation).

4. Awkward phrasing: "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." (awkward), "The water is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the consecration produces no change in its quality or substance." (awkward), "The new birth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in the soul." (awkward).

5. Inconsistent formatting: The text mixes different quotation styles and has inconsistent use of italics.

### Coherence Issues:
1. The text jumps abruptly between different topics without clear transitions: It moves from discussing the Church of England's teachings to the nature of sacraments, to the differences between Catholic and Protestant views, and then to specific articles of the Church without clear connections.

2. The text is repetitive: It repeatedly emphasizes the Church of England's position on the nature of sacraments without clearly differentiating between its actual teaching and the author's interpretation.

3. The logical flow is sometimes confusing: The author presents their argument about the Church of England's position on the Lord's Supper, but the connections between premises and conclusions are not always clear or well-structured.

4. The text is overly complex and dense: The argument is presented in a very formal, theological style with complex sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the logical progression of the argument.

5. The text lacks clear organization: While there are chapter headings, the structure within each chapter is not always clear or logical. The argument sometimes meanders without clear signposting.

6. The text contains some contradictory statements: For example, it states that the Church of England's definition of sacraments is clear, but then presents a complex theological argument that seems to contradict itself at times.

### Scoring:
For fluency: The text has numerous spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, as well as awkward phrasing. These issues significantly affect the readability of the text. I would rate it a 2 out of 5 for fluency.

For coherence: While the text presents a theological argument, it suffers from poor organization, confusing logical flow, and a lack of clear transitions between ideas. The density and complexity of the argument make it difficult to follow, and the text sometimes contradicts itself. I would rate it a 2 out of 5 for coherence.
