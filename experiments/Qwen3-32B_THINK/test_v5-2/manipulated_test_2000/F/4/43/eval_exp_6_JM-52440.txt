Alright, I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding the evaluation criteria.

**Coherence** refers to how well the story is structured, with logically sequenced ideas, smooth transitions, and a clear narrative flow. The story should avoid ambiguities and abrupt jumps, maintaining consistency and a clear structure.

**Fluency** focuses on the readability of the text. This includes proper syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The language should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

Now, let's examine the provided story. It's a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The text is quite dense, with complex theological concepts and arguments. 

For **Coherence**:
- The story is well-structured, with a clear introduction, followed by a detailed discussion of the Real Presence in the first chapter.
- The narrative progresses logically, discussing different aspects of the doctrine and supporting arguments.
- There are clear transitions between sections and a consistent focus on the central topic.
- However, the text is dense and may be challenging for some readers due to the complexity of the subject matter and the formal, academic tone.

For **Fluency**:
- The text is written in formal, archaic English with complex sentence structures.
- There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This sentence is particularly problematic in terms of grammar and clarity.
- The text uses complex theological terminology, which is appropriate for the subject matter but may be difficult for general readers.
- There are some punctuation issues and awkward phrasing that affect the flow of the text.

Based on my analysis:
- **Coherence Score**: The story is well-structured and logically progresses through its arguments. The narrative is clear and maintains a consistent focus on the central topic. I would rate this as a 4.
- **Fluency Score**: The text has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that affect readability. The complex sentence structures and archaic language also make it less fluent for general readers. I would rate this as a 3.

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested format.

Issues: 
- Several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that disrupt readability (e.g., "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.")
- Some complex theological terminology and archaic language may be difficult for general readers
- Long, convoluted sentences that make the text dense and challenging to follow
- A few punctuation issues that affect the flow of the text

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
