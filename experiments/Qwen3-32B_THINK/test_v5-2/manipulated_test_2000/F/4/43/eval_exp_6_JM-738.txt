Alright, let me take a look at this story and evaluate it based on the given criteria of Coherence and Fluency.

First, I'll read through the story carefully to understand its content and structure.

The story appears to be an analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," focusing on the plot, characters, and literary style. It begins with an introduction discussing Dickens' approach to construction in his later works, then moves into a detailed analysis of the characters and plot of "Edwin Drood."

Now, I'll evaluate the story for Coherence and Fluency:

**Coherence:**
1. The story has a clear structure, starting with an introduction, moving to character analysis, and then describing the plot.
2. However, there are some issues with logical sequencing and flow. The transition from the introduction to the character analysis is somewhat abrupt.
3. Some sections appear disjointed or poorly connected. For example, the part about Lord Lytton's tale seems inserted without clear connection to the main discussion of Dickens.
4. There are some confusing passages, particularly in the analysis of characters and plot. For instance, the section about Mr. Cuming Walters and his theories is presented without sufficient context.
5. The narrative sometimes jumps between different topics without clear transitions, which can make it difficult to follow the author's argument.
6. The story occasionally repeats information or goes off on tangents that don't clearly relate to the main discussion.

**Fluency:**
1. There are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the text. For example, "Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_." This sentence is completely incoherent.
2. Some sentences have incorrect word order or missing words, making them difficult to understand. For example, "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful 'A. by a late,' deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)."
3. There are punctuation issues and inconsistent formatting, including the use of underscores and strange spacing.
4. Some sentences are overly complex and hard to follow, with multiple clauses and unclear connections.
5. There are instances of run-on sentences and sentence fragments.

Based on these observations, I'll now rate the story according to the requested metrics:

**Coherence Score:** I'll rate this as a 3. The story has a clear structure and organization, but there are significant issues with logical flow and transitions between sections. The narrative sometimes jumps between topics without clear connections, and some sections appear disjointed or poorly integrated into the overall discussion.

**Fluency Score:** I'll rate this as a 2. There are numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and punctuation issues throughout the text. Many sentences are difficult to understand due to incorrect word order, missing words, or overly complex structure. The text would benefit significantly from thorough proofreading and editing.

Now I'll list the specific issues that lead to these scores:
</think>

Issues: 
- Incoherent and grammatically incorrect sentences throughout the text (e.g., "Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_")
- Disjointed sections with poor transitions between ideas and topics
- Confusing passages with unclear connections to the main discussion
- Punctuation errors and inconsistent formatting (underscores, strange spacing)
- Run-on sentences and sentence fragments
- Some sections appear to be cut off or incomplete
- Repetition of information and tangents that don't clearly relate to the main narrative
- Overly complex sentence structures that are difficult to follow
- Missing words and incorrect word order in multiple places

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
