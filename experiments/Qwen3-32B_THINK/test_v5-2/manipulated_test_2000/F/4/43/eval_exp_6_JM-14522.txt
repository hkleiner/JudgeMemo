Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The instructions are pretty clear, but I need to make sure I understand them correctly.

First, I need to list the issues in bullet points. The evaluation criteria are Coherence and Fluency. Coherence is about the overall structure, logical sequence, and consistency of the narrative. Fluency is about individual sentence-level issues like grammar, syntax, word choice, etc.

Looking at the story provided, it's a mix of a coherent narrative and some parts that are a bit problematic. Let me go through it step by step.

Starting with the first part, the story seems to be an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The initial paragraphs are well-written, with proper grammar and coherent plot progression. However, there are some parts that stand out. 

In the section where Mr. Otis responds to Lord Canterville, there's a paragraph that reads: "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..." This part is clearly a jumble of words without proper syntax or meaning. It's a major fluency issue because it's incoherent and doesn't make sense. Similarly, the paragraph that starts with "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed." This also has grammatical errors and is not properly structured.

Moving on, in Chapter II, the first sentence is: "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred." This is another example of poor sentence structure and word order. The words don't form a coherent sentence, which affects fluency. 

There are also some minor issues like missing punctuation or incorrect word usage, but the main problems are the jumbled paragraphs that disrupt the flow of the story. These sections make the text difficult to read and understand, which impacts both fluency and coherence. However, the rest of the story is well-written and maintains a logical progression, so coherence is mostly intact except for the problematic parts.

For Coherence: The story generally follows a logical sequence, with a clear narrative about the Otis family encountering the ghost. The main issues are the jumbled paragraphs that break the flow, but the overall structure is coherent. So the Coherence score might be a 4, as the main narrative is coherent, but the problematic parts could lower it to a 3 if they significantly disrupt the flow. However, the rest of the story is well-structured, so maybe a 4 is still appropriate.

For Fluency: The jumbled paragraphs are major issues. The first problematic paragraph is completely incoherent, and the second one is also grammatically incorrect. These would significantly lower the fluency score. Even though the rest of the text is fluent, these errors are notable. So Fluency might be a 2 or 3. Considering that most of the text is fluent except for those sections, maybe a 3. But if those sections are very prominent, maybe a 2.

Wait, the user wants the scores as integers between 1 and 5. Let me check the scale again. A 5 would be excellent, no issues. A 4 is very good with minor issues. A 3 is adequate with some issues. A 2 is poor with significant issues, and 1 is very poor.

Given that there are a couple of major fluency issues (the jumbled paragraphs) that are quite severe, but the rest is good, Fluency might be a 3. Coherence is mostly maintained, so maybe a 4. However, the jumbled parts could affect the overall coherence as well. If the reader is confused by those parts, it might lower the Coherence score to a 3. But the story otherwise is coherent. So I need to decide if the jumbled parts are enough to lower the Coherence score. Since the main narrative is coherent and the issues are isolated, maybe Coherence stays at 4. Fluency is definitely lower because of the grammatical errors in those sections. So Fluency would be a 3.

Issues: 
- Incoherent and grammatically incorrect paragraph: "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..."
- Another jumbled paragraph: "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed."
- Disjointed and poorly structured opening of Chapter II: "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred."
- Minor punctuation and word choice issues in some sentences.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
