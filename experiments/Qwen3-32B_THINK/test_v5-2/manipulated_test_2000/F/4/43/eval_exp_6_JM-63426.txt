Alright, I need to evaluate the given story for Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding what each criterion entails:

**Fluency** refers to how smoothly the text reads, focusing on:
- Syntax and grammar
- Spelling
- Word choice and phrasing
- Punctuation

**Coherence** refers to how well the story is structured as a whole, focusing on:
- Logical sequencing of ideas
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Consistency and clarity of the narrative
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps

Now I'll examine the story for issues under these two criteria.

Looking at **Fluency** first:

Issues I notice:
- There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example: "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work."
- Some sentences have incorrect word order or missing words. For example: "In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through."
- There are punctuation errors and run-on sentences.
- Some phrases are not well formed. For example: "Your anywayarithmetic n’t like, do."
- There's a question mark in an odd place: "heated (?) with one stove."
- Some sentences are missing articles or prepositions.
- There are some typos or missing words in the text.

For **Coherence**:

Issues I notice:
- The story jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.
- There are some abrupt shifts between describing Will Bradley and then switching to a story about a boy printer in Ishpeming.
- The narrative structure is not always clear, with some paragraphs lacking clear connections to what came before or after.
- The text sometimes introduces new ideas without sufficient setup.
- The overall organization of the story could be clearer, especially how the different sections connect to each other.

Now I'll rate each criterion on a scale from 1 to 5:

For **Fluency**:
- The text has multiple grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues.
- Some sentences are difficult to understand due to poor construction.
- However, the overall meaning is generally clear despite these issues.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the scale. It has significant fluency issues that would distract a reader and make the text harder to follow.

For **Coherence**:
- The story has some logical sequencing and a clear narrative in parts.
- However, there are significant issues with transitions between sections and maintaining a consistent narrative thread.
- The shift from the introduction about Will Bradley to the story of the boy printer feels abrupt and not well connected.
- The overall structure could be more coherent and better organized.
- I would rate this as a 2 on the scale. The story lacks a clear, consistent narrative flow and has several coherence issues that make it difficult to follow as a whole.

Let me re-read the text to confirm my assessment and make sure I haven't missed anything.

Issues: 
- Grammatical errors and awkward phrasings in sentences like "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work."
- Incorrect word order and missing words in sentences like "Your anywayarithmetic n’t like, do."
- Punctuation errors and run-on sentences throughout the text
- Question mark in an odd place: "heated (?) with one stove."
- Missing articles and prepositions in several sentences
- Abrupt shifts between different time periods and perspectives
- Sudden transition from the introduction about Will Bradley to the story of the boy printer in Ishpeming without clear connection
- Some paragraphs lack clear connections to what came before or after
- Narrative structure is not always clear, with new ideas introduced without sufficient setup

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
