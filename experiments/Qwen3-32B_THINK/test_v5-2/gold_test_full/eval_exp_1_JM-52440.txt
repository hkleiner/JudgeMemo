Alright, let me start by reading through the given story to understand what I need to evaluate. The story is a theological text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite detailed and dense, with multiple chapters and sections.

First, I need to evaluate the Coherence of the story. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and consistency. The story is structured into chapters and sections, which is a good start. However, I should check if the ideas are connected smoothly and if there are any abrupt jumps or repetitions.

Looking at the content, the author is presenting an argument against the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England. The text moves through various documents like the Articles of Religion, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies to support this argument. The structure is logical in that it addresses each point systematically. However, the length and complexity of the text might make it challenging for the reader to follow without prior knowledge of the subject. There are instances where the author goes into detailed theological debates and historical context, which could be overwhelming. The argument is consistent in its stance, but some sections might feel repetitive, especially when reiterating the same points across different documents. The conclusion ties back to the introduction, which is good for coherence.

Now, for Fluency. Fluency is about the readability of the text, including grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The story is written in a formal, archaic style, which is appropriate for the subject matter but might be less accessible to a modern reader. There are instances of complex sentences that could be difficult to parse. For example, some sentences run long and contain multiple clauses, which might affect readability. However, the grammar and punctuation are generally correct. The use of archaic terms and sentence structures (like "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion") is consistent throughout, so it doesn't seem like an error but a stylistic choice. There are no obvious spelling mistakes or awkward phrasing that would disrupt the flow. The vocabulary is precise, which is necessary for a theological argument, but might be challenging for some readers.

Potential issues for Coherence:
- The text is very dense and could benefit from clearer signposting between sections.
- Some theological arguments might be too detailed for a general audience, potentially leading to confusion.
- There's a risk of repetition when discussing similar points across different documents (Articles, Catechism, etc.).

Potential issues for Fluency:
- The archaic language and complex sentence structures might be difficult for modern readers.
- Some sentences are overly long and could be broken down for better readability.
- The use of theological jargon might be a barrier for those unfamiliar with the subject.

Considering all these factors, I would rate the Coherence as a 4. The story is well-structured and logically progresses through its arguments, but the density and complexity could hinder some readers. For Fluency, I would also rate it a 4. The text is grammatically correct and uses appropriate vocabulary, but the archaic style and complex sentences might affect readability for a broader audience.

Issues:  
- **Coherence**: The story is logically structured with clear sections and a consistent argument, but the dense theological content and repetitive emphasis on key points (e.g., refuting the Real Presence) may feel cumbersome. The historical and doctrinal analysis is thorough but could benefit from tighter transitions between sections to avoid abrupt shifts in focus.  
- **Fluency**: The archaic and formal language (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion") and complex sentence structures (e.g., multi-clause sentences with semicolons) may hinder readability for modern readers. While grammatically correct, the text occasionally uses jargon and assumes prior knowledge of theological terms (e.g., "transubstantiation"), which could create barriers for clarity.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
