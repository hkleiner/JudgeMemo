Let me analyze the story and evaluate it based on the two criteria: coherence and fluency.

First, I'll look at the structure and overall narrative flow to assess coherence. The story is about Will Bradley, an American graphic designer and typographer. It's written in a biographical style with various chapters covering different periods of his life and career.

Looking at coherence:
- The narrative is generally well-structured, with chapters organized chronologically
- There is a clear progression from Bradley's childhood in a printing family to his career in graphic design
- The story connects different phases of his life and career in a logical way
- However, there are some issues with coherence:
  - The story jumps between different time periods and topics at times without clear transitions
  - Some chapters read like separate essays rather than a unified biography
  - The writing style shifts between first-person and third-person perspectives
  - There are some inconsistencies in tense usage
  - The final "Afterword" section feels somewhat disconnected from the main narrative

Now for fluency:
- The language is generally clear and well-written
- The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter
- However, there are some issues with fluency:
  - The story contains many run-on sentences and long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow
  - There are some awkward phrasings and odd word choices
  - The story uses some outdated or archaic language that might be confusing to modern readers
  - There are some grammatical errors and punctuation issues
  - The writing style is somewhat inconsistent, shifting between a more formal, literary style and a more casual, conversational style

Based on my assessment:

Coherence Score: 3/5
The story has a clear narrative about Will Bradley's life and career, but suffers from some coherence issues with jumps in time, inconsistent perspectives, and a somewhat disjointed structure with chapters that sometimes feel like separate essays.

Fluency Score: 3/5
The language is generally clear and appropriate for the subject matter, but the story contains many long, complex sentences, some awkward phrasing, and some grammatical issues that affect readability. The writing style is also somewhat inconsistent.

Let me now list the specific issues in bullet points:

Issues:
- The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions
- Some chapters read like separate essays rather than a unified biography
- The writing style shifts between first-person and third-person perspectives
- There are inconsistencies in tense usage throughout the text
- The final "Afterword" section feels somewhat disconnected from the main narrative
- The story contains many run-on sentences and long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow
- There are some awkward phrasings and odd word choices
- The story uses some outdated or archaic language that might be confusing to modern readers
- There are some grammatical errors and punctuation issues
- The writing style is somewhat inconsistent, shifting between a more formal, literary style and a more casual, conversational style
- Some parts of the text are overly verbose and could be more concise
- The text contains some technical jargon related to printing and typography that may be unfamiliar to general readers
- The story occasionally repeats information or ideas
- The narrative could use more clear signposting to help readers follow the chronology of events
- The text sometimes lacks clear connections between ideas or paragraphs
- The final "Chronology" section at the end is somewhat redundant with the main narrative
