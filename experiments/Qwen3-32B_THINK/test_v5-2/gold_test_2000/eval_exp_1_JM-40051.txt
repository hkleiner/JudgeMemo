Okay, let's start by reading the story carefully. The user wants me to evaluate the coherence and fluency of this text. 

First, fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, word choice, syntax, and punctuation. Let me go through the text again. I notice some typos like "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions". There's also "admirirg" which is "admiring". The word "scientest" should be "scientist". Some sentences are run-ons or have awkward phrasing. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles..." has a missing subject after the period. Also, there are inconsistent tenses and some missing articles. 

Now coherence. The story is about identifying a location as the Garden of Eden based on biblical descriptions. The structure is a bit all over the place. The author jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. For example, after talking about the Mississippi River, there's a sudden shift to a specific town, Trempealeau, without much connection. The argument is made through comparisons but lacks a logical flow. Some parts are repetitive, like mentioning the Garden's characteristics multiple times without building on previous points. The conclusion feels abrupt, ending with a description of the city of La Crosse without tying back to the main thesis.

Putting it all together. For fluency, the issues are numerous typos, awkward sentence structures, missing punctuation, and some grammatical errors. This would lower the fluency score. For coherence, the lack of logical progression, abrupt shifts, and repetition would impact it. I'll rate fluency as 2 and coherence as 3. The story is understandable but has significant issues in both areas.

Issues: 
- Multiple spelling errors ("antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "jageed").
- Grammatical errors (e.g., "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared..." lacks subject-verb agreement).
- Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible...").
- Inconsistent tenses and missing articles/prepositions.
- Repetitive ideas about the Garden of Eden's characteristics.
- Abrupt shifts in focus (e.g., from biblical analysis to geographical descriptions without clear transitions).
- Unclear logical connections between claims (e.g., how specific geographical features "prove" Eden's location).
- Overuse of hyperbolic comparisons ("beau ideal of a garden," "unequalled in America").

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
