Alright, let's start by reading the story provided. The story is about the last novel of Charles Dickens, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," and discusses the construction of the plot, the characters, and the various theories surrounding the ending. 

Now, I need to evaluate the story for coherence and fluency. 

**Coherence:**
Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole. It should have a logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth transitions between sections, and avoid ambiguities or abrupt jumps. 

Looking at the story, it's structured in a way that starts with an introduction discussing Dickens's approach to plot construction, then moves into the specific story of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," providing character descriptions, and then into the analysis of the plot and theories about the ending. The structure seems logical and progressive.

However, there are some points where the coherence might be lacking. The story jumps between discussing Dickens's writing style, the plot of the novel, and then into the analysis of the theories about the ending. There are also some references to other works and authors that might not be as smoothly integrated. For example, the mention of Lord Lytton's tale and the analysis of different theories by Proctor and Walters could be a bit disjointed if not properly connected to the main narrative.

Also, there are some complex sentences and academic jargon that might make the flow less smooth for a general reader. The story is more of an analysis than a narrative, so it's expected to have some academic tone, but it should still maintain a coherent thread from start to finish.

**Fluency:**
Fluency is about how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

The story is written in a formal, academic style. The sentences are long and complex, with many clauses and semicolons. This is not necessarily a bad thing for an academic text, but it could affect the fluency for a general reader. 

Looking for errors in grammar or spelling, I don't see any obvious mistakes. The use of punctuation is generally correct, though the sentence structure is quite dense. There are some instances of awkward phrasing or overly complex sentences that might make the text less fluent. For example:

- "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." - This sentence is a bit long and could be split for better clarity.

- "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers." - The colon here is used to join two independent clauses, which is grammatically correct, but the sentence could be more fluid if split into two sentences.

- "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in _Mugby Junction_." - The phrase "too material premonitions" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

Overall, the text is well-written from a grammatical standpoint, but the dense and complex sentence structure might make it less fluent for some readers.

**Issues:**
Let me list the issues that affect the scores for coherence and fluency.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. The story jumps between different topics (Dickens's writing style, the plot of the novel, theories about the ending) without always providing clear transitions.
2. Some references to other works and authors (e.g., Lord Lytton, Mr. Proctor, Mr. Cuming Walters) are not as smoothly integrated into the main narrative.
3. The academic tone and complex analysis might make it harder for a general reader to follow the logical progression of the story.
4. Some sections (like the character descriptions and the opening of the tale) are detailed but could be more clearly connected to the overall analysis.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. Long, complex sentences with many clauses and semicolons make the text less fluid and harder to read.
2. Some awkward phrasing and word choices (e.g., "too material premonitions") could be rephrased for clarity.
3. The use of academic jargon and dense prose might make the text less accessible to a general audience.
4. Some sentences could be split for better readability and flow.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations.

**Coherence Score:**
The story has a logical structure and follows a clear progression from introduction to analysis. However, the jumps between different topics and the dense academic tone affect the overall coherence. I would rate this as a 4 out of 5.

**Fluency Score:**
The text is well-written grammatically, but the long, complex sentences and dense prose affect the fluency. The academic style makes it less accessible to a general reader. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5.

Issues:  
- The text occasionally jumps between topics (e.g., Dickens's writing style, plot analysis, and theories) without clear transitions.  
- Some academic references (e.g., Lord Lytton, R. A. Proctor) are less smoothly integrated into the narrative.  
- Long, complex sentences and dense phrasing (e.g., "too material premonitions") reduce readability.  
- The academic tone and jargon may hinder accessibility for general readers.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
