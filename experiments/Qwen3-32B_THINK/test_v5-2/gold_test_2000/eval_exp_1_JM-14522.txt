Alright, let's start by reading the given story and understanding the evaluation criteria. The task is to rate the story for Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. I need to first identify any issues with the story's coherence and fluency and then assign scores accordingly.

**Coherence** refers to how well the story is structured and how logically the ideas flow. A coherent story has a clear progression, is not repetitive, and avoids abrupt jumps or ambiguities. 

**Fluency** focuses on the smoothness of the language, including proper grammar, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. A fluent text reads naturally without awkward phrasing or errors.

Now, let's examine the provided story, which is an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The story is a well-written and classic piece, so I expect high scores, but I need to be objective and look for any issues.

### Issues with Coherence:
1. **Pacing and Structure**: The story moves quickly from one scene to another without much transition. For example, the transition from the Otis family arriving to the first encounter with the ghost is abrupt.
2. **Character Introduction**: Characters are introduced in a list-like manner with minimal context or development, which can make it hard to connect with them.
3. **Lack of Explanations**: Some references (e.g., "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover") are mentioned without context, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the story or the product.
4. **Jump in Time**: The story jumps from the arrival at Canterville Chase to the first night with the ghost without clear transition or explanation.

### Issues with Fluency:
1. **Awkward Phrasing**: Some sentences are long and complex, which can be confusing (e.g., the sentence about the conversation topics at supper).
2. **Word Choice**: Some phrases are archaic or overly formal (e.g., "phantasmata" instead of "ghosts") that might not be immediately clear to all readers.
3. **Punctuation**: There are instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, particularly in dialogue and long descriptive sentences.
4. **Consistency**: There are inconsistencies in verb tenses and pronoun usage in some sentences.
5. **Run-on Sentences**: A few sentences run on without proper breaks, making them hard to follow.

Given that this is a classic work by Oscar Wilde, it's likely that the story is well-written and would score high on both metrics. However, the provided excerpt might have some minor issues in fluency and coherence.

### Coherence Score:
The story has a clear narrative with a logical progression, but the transitions between scenes and the introduction of characters are somewhat abrupt. The structure is mostly clear and the plot is consistent. There are no major coherence issues that would significantly impact the reader's understanding.

I would rate this a 4 for Coherence because it's mostly well-structured with a clear narrative, but there are some minor issues with transitions and character introductions.

### Fluency Score:
The language is generally fluent with proper grammar and punctuation. However, there are a few instances of awkward phrasing, complex sentences that could be simplified, and some archaic word choices that might not be immediately clear. The dialogue is generally well-written.

I would rate this a 4 for Fluency because it's mostly smooth and readable, but there are some minor issues with phrasing and complexity.

Let me now write my final response in the requested format.

Issues: 
- Sudden transitions between scenes without clear narrative flow
- Characters introduced in a list-like manner with minimal development
- Some archaic/complex word choices may confuse modern readers (e.g., "phantasmata")
- Long, complex sentences that could be simplified for clarity
- Minor punctuation issues in dialogue and descriptive passages

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
