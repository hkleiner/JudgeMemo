Alright, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want me to act as a human annotator to rate a story's quality based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story provided is a theological text about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England.

First, I need to break down the evaluation criteria. Coherence is about the overall structure and logical flow of the story, ensuring ideas are connected smoothly without abrupt jumps or inconsistencies. Fluency focuses on the language at the sentence level, checking for grammar, syntax, spelling, and smooth phrasing.

Looking at the story, it's a formal theological treatise. The structure is clear with an introduction and chapters, but I should check if the ideas transition smoothly. The author addresses a specific doctrine, compares it with Roman Catholic views, and references church documents. There's a lot of complex terminology and theological concepts. I need to see if the flow of ideas is logical and if each section builds on the previous one.

For Fluency, I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The text is written in an older style with archaic language (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion"), which might affect readability for some, but it's consistent. I need to check if the sentences are well-constructed and if the meaning is clear without being overly convoluted.

Potential issues for Coherence might include the density of information, the complexity of the subject matter making it hard to follow, or if there are any abrupt shifts in topics. The author moves from discussing the Church's teachings to comparing them with Rome's views, which is logical, but the depth of theological terms might make it less coherent for readers unfamiliar with the subject.

For Fluency, possible issues could be the use of archaic language, sentence structure that's too long or complex, or any grammatical mistakes. The text seems to have correct grammar, but the sentence structure is quite formal and may be challenging for some readers. Also, the use of terms like "κοινωνία" (Greek) without explanation might be a point of confusion.

I need to list specific issues under each category. For Coherence, maybe the lack of clear transitions between sections, the dense content that might overwhelm readers, or the assumption of prior knowledge. For Fluency, perhaps the archaic phrasing, complex sentences that are hard to parse, or the inclusion of technical terms without context.

After identifying these issues, I'll assign scores. Coherence might be a 4 because the structure is logical but the content is dense and may be hard to follow for some. Fluency could be a 4 as well, given the correct grammar but the challenging sentence structures and archaic language.

I should make sure the issues are clearly listed in bullet points and the scores are integers between 1 and 5. The final answer should follow the specified format without any additional explanations.

Issues:  
- Coherence: The text is dense and theological, with complex arguments that may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with the subject. Some transitions between ideas are abrupt (e.g., sudden shifts from doctrinal discussion to historical context). The assumption of prior knowledge about church documents and theological terms may hinder clarity.  
- Fluency: The archaic and formal language ("It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion," "granted in connexion with the other") and long, convoluted sentences reduce readability. Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the one is not changed into the other, but that the water remains water") and technical jargon without explanation (e.g., "κοινωνία") may confuse readers.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
