I need to evaluate the given story according to the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me first understand what the story is about and then identify the issues related to coherence and fluency.

The story is a detailed description of a region in the United States that the author claims to be the Garden of Eden. It's written in a somewhat formal and elaborate style, with the author presenting various geographical and biblical arguments to support this claim.

Now, let me analyze the issues related to coherence and fluency:

Coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] The story lacks a clear logical progression. It jumps between different arguments and descriptions without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is disorganized. The text appears to be a collection of loosely connected observations and arguments rather than a coherent narrative.
- [CLARITY] Many parts of the text are confusing or unclear. The author often makes sweeping claims without sufficient evidence or explanation.
- [TRANSITION] There are few or no effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas. The text often moves abruptly from one topic to another.
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative is inconsistent in tone and focus, alternating between geographical descriptions, biblical interpretations, and what appears to be random observations.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The perspective shifts throughout the text without explanation or context.

Fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and other grammatical inconsistencies.
- [SPELLING] There are spelling errors throughout the text, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admir ing."
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward or ungrammatical, with run-on sentences and confusing constructions.
- [PUNCTUATION] Punctuation is often incorrect or missing, particularly with commas and periods.
- [LEXICON] There are instances of word choice that doesn't match the intended meaning or that is simply incorrect.
- [PHRASING] The phrasing is often awkward or unnatural, with overly complex or convoluted expressions.
- [REPETITION] There is significant repetition of ideas and phrases without adding new information.
- [CONJUNCTIONS] The use of conjunctions is inconsistent and often missing, leading to choppy or disconnected writing.

Now, let me summarize the issues and assign scores:

Coherence Score:
The story lacks a clear structure, logical progression, and consistent perspective. While it presents a central theme (identifying the Garden of Eden in the US), the presentation is disjointed and often confusing. The text reads more like a collection of random observations and arguments rather than a coherent narrative. I would rate this as a 2 on the coherence scale.

Fluency Score:
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues. The writing style is often convoluted and difficult to follow. While the author's ideas may be interesting, the poor execution makes the text hard to read. I would rate this as a 2 on the fluency scale.

Let me now finalize my assessment with specific issues listed:
