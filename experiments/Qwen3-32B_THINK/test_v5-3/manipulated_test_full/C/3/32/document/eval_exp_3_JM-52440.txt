Alright, let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence. First, I need to understand what the text is about. It appears to be a theological discussion about the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England, comparing it with other Christian denominations like Rome and discussing the concepts of the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The author is examining the Church of England's teachings through its Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies to determine whether it teaches the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

Now, let me assess fluency first. Fluency focuses on how the text reads from start to finish, looking at syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Issues I notice in fluency:
[GRAMMAR] - There are some grammatical issues. For example, "the thing" is used repeatedly, likely as a placeholder for "the Church of England," which is confusing and ungrammatical. This appears in many places like "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine." The use of "a stuff" also appears repeatedly, which is grammatically incorrect and confusing.
[SYNTAX] - Some sentences are very long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to a thing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our a thing." The syntax here is confusing and needs to be clarified.
[LEXICON] - There are instances of unclear or incorrect word usage. The term "a stuff" is used repeatedly, which seems to be a placeholder for "the Church of England" and is grammatically incorrect.
[SPELLING] - I don't see obvious spelling errors, but the use of "a stuff" and "a thing" is problematic.
[PUNCTUATION] - There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and commas in complex sentences.

Now, let me assess coherence. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities, and consistent structure.

Issues I notice in coherence:
[LOGIC] - The text is logically structured in that it follows a clear argument: introduction, analysis of the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. However, the frequent use of "a stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders for "the Church of England" creates confusion and undermines the logical flow.
[STRUCTURE] - The text is well-structured with clear chapters and sections. However, the use of placeholders like "a stuff" and "a thing" disrupts the structure and makes it harder to follow.
[CLARITY] - The text is generally clear in its theological arguments, but the repeated use of placeholders makes it unclear and confusing. The author's intent is to discuss the Church of England's teachings, but the use of incorrect terms like "a stuff" and "a thing" hinders clarity.
[TRANSITION] - Transitions between sections are generally smooth, but the use of placeholders can make some transitions confusing. The author moves from one theological point to another, but the placeholders create unnecessary confusion.
[REPETITION] - There is some repetition in the arguments, particularly in the discussion of the Church of England's stance on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. This repetition is somewhat expected in a theological treatise, but it could be streamlined for better coherence.

Overall, the text is a detailed theological treatise that is well-structured and logically organized. However, the repeated use of placeholders like "a stuff" and "a thing" instead of "the Church of England" significantly hinders both fluency and coherence. These placeholders are grammatically incorrect and make the text confusing to read. The author's arguments are sound, but the poor word choice and frequent placeholders make it difficult to follow the reasoning.

For fluency, I would give this text a 2. The text has many grammatical and lexical issues due to the repeated use of placeholders, which makes it difficult to read and understand. The syntax is complex and some sentences are too long, contributing to the lack of fluency.

For coherence, I would give this text a 3. The text is logically structured with clear sections and a coherent argument. However, the frequent use of placeholders creates confusion and disrupts the flow of the argument. The author's intent is clear, but the poor word choice makes it difficult to follow the reasoning in a coherent way.

I'll now write my final answer in the required format.

Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders for "the Church of England" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.  
[SYNTAX] - Long, complex sentences with poor structure make the text difficult to follow.  
[LEXICON] - Incorrect word usage (e.g., "a stuff" instead of "the Church of England") creates confusion.  
[CLARITY] - The repeated use of placeholders disrupts clarity and understanding of the argument.  
[LOGIC] - While the overall structure is logical, the placeholders and inconsistent terminology undermine the logical flow.  
[STRUCTURE] - The text is well-structured with clear chapters, but frequent placeholders disrupt the structure.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
