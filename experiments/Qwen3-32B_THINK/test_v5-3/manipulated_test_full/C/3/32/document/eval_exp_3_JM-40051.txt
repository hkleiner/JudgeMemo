I need to evaluate this story based on the given criteria of Coherence and Fluency, and provide a score for each from 1 to 5.

First, let me understand what the story is about:
This is a long, detailed account of a supposed discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest, specifically in the region around the Mississippi River. The author describes the geography, topography, and features of this area, drawing parallels with the biblical description of Eden. The narrative is written in a somewhat archaic style, with long sentences and complex descriptions.

Now, let's evaluate the story based on the two metrics:

**Fluency** focuses on how well the text reads, including:
- Syntax (sentence structure)
- Grammar
- Spelling
- Word choice
- Phrasing
- Punctuation

Looking at the text, I notice several issues that affect fluency:
1. [GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, missing articles, and incorrect verb forms.
2. [SPELLING] - There are spelling mistakes throughout the text.
3. [SYNTAX] - The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, with long, run-on sentences.
4. [LEXICON] - There are instances of incorrect word usage and misspelled words.
5. [PUNCTUATION] - The punctuation is often inconsistent or missing, particularly in long descriptive passages.

**Coherence** focuses on how the story unfolds as a whole, including:
- Logical sequence
- Non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas
- Clear progression from one section to another
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps
- Consistent and clear narrative structure

Looking at the text, I notice several issues that affect coherence:
1. [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear structure. It's a long, meandering description without clear organization or transitions between ideas.
2. [LOGIC] - The logical flow is often disrupted by the author's tendency to jump from one descriptive point to another without clear connections.
3. [CLARITY] - The narrative is often unclear due to the author's elaborate and sometimes confusing descriptions.
4. [TRANSITION] - There are few clear transitions between different sections or ideas.
5. [REPETITION] - There is significant repetition of ideas and descriptions.

Now, I'll list the specific issues I've identified and provide scores for both metrics:

Based on my evaluation:
- The fluency issues are numerous and significant, making the text difficult to read at times.
- The coherence issues are also significant, with the text lacking a clear structure and logical flow.

For fluency, I would rate this a 2 out of 5 - it's readable but has many errors that affect readability.
For coherence, I would rate this a 2 out of 5 - it's difficult to follow the author's argument and the text lacks a clear structure.

Let me now provide a more detailed evaluation:

Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, such as "have a reasonable thing of it" instead of "have a reasonable thing of it" or "have a reasonable understanding of it."
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions," "beatiful" instead of "beautiful," "jageed" instead of "jagged."
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow, such as the multi-sentence paragraph that begins "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth..."
- [LEXICON] Incorrect word usage, such as "a scientest" instead of "a scientist," "a thing" used repeatedly as a placeholder, "a stuff" used similarly.
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent punctuation, particularly missing commas in long descriptive passages.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure. It's a long, meandering description without clear organization or sections.
- [LOGIC] The logical flow is often disrupted by the author's tendency to jump from one descriptive point to another without clear connections.
- [CLARITY] The narrative is often unclear due to the author's elaborate and sometimes confusing descriptions.
- [TRANSITION] Few clear transitions between different sections or ideas.
- [REPETITION] Significant repetition of ideas and descriptions, such as repeatedly describing the same geographical features from different angles.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
