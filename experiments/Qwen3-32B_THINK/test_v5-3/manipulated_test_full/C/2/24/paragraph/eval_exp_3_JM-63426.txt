Alright, I'll evaluate the story based on the given criteria of Coherence and Fluency.

First, I'll identify any issues with the text under the relevant categories:

For Coherence:
- [STRUCTURE]: The story is quite long and has multiple chapters, which could potentially make it feel disjointed. The narrative jumps between different time periods and aspects of Will Bradley's life without always clear transitions.
- [LOGIC]: Some parts of the story are difficult to follow, particularly the transitions between different phases of Will Bradley's career. There are some abrupt shifts in time and context.
- [CLARITY]: Some sentences are complex and could be clearer. The story sometimes jumps between different aspects of Will Bradley's life without sufficient context.
- [TRANSITION]: The transitions between different chapters and sections are sometimes abrupt, making it harder to follow the narrative flow.

For Fluency:
- [GRAMMAR]: The text has some grammatical issues, though they're not pervasive. For example, there are some run-on sentences and occasional subject-verb agreement issues.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly structured, making them harder to read.
- [SPELLING]: I notice a few potential spelling errors, though they're not numerous enough to significantly impact reading.
- [LEXICON]: The vocabulary is generally appropriate and rich, but some words are used in a way that's slightly confusing or unusual.
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of commas and periods in complex sentences.

Now I'll rate the story on both metrics:

Coherence Score: 
The story has a clear narrative about Will Bradley's life and career, but it's quite long and the structure could be improved. The narrative sometimes jumps between different time periods and aspects of his life without sufficient transitions or context. While the content is interesting and informative, the lack of clear structure and occasional abrupt transitions make it somewhat difficult to follow as a continuous narrative.

Fluency Score: 
The text is generally well-written with rich vocabulary and descriptive language. However, there are some grammatical and syntactical issues that affect readability. Some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly structured. There are also a few punctuation issues. While the text is mostly fluent, these issues can make reading and comprehension a bit challenging at times.

Overall, I would rate the Coherence as a 3 and the Fluency as a 3, as both have significant strengths but also notable areas for improvement.

Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE]: The story is very long with multiple chapters that sometimes feel disconnected. The narrative jumps between different phases of Will Bradley's life without always clear transitions or context.
- [LOGIC]: Some parts of the story are difficult to follow, particularly the transitions between different periods in Will Bradley's career. There are some abrupt shifts in time and context that could be better explained.
- [CLARITY]: Some sentences are complex and could be clearer. The story sometimes jumps between different aspects of Will Bradley's life without sufficient context.
- [TRANSITION]: The transitions between different chapters and sections are sometimes abrupt, making it harder to follow the narrative flow.
- [GRAMMAR]: There are some grammatical issues, though they're not pervasive. For example, there are some run-on sentences and occasional subject-verb agreement issues.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly structured, making them harder to read.
- [SPELLING]: There are a few potential spelling errors, though they're not numerous enough to significantly impact reading.
- [LEXICON]: The vocabulary is generally appropriate and rich, but some words are used in a way that's slightly confusing or unusual.
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of commas and periods in complex sentences.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
