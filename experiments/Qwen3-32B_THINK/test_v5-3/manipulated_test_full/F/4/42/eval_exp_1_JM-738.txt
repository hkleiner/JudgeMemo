Alright, let me break down this task. I'm given a long story about the mystery of Edwin Drood by Dickens, and I need to evaluate it based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. The story is written in an academic or analytical style, discussing various theories about the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."

First, I'll evaluate Coherence. Coherence refers to how well the story flows as a whole, how logically connected the ideas are, and how clear the narrative is. The story presents an analysis of Dickens's novel, discussing theories from different critics, and proposes its own interpretation. I need to check if the story has a clear structure, if the ideas build on each other, and if there are any abrupt jumps or inconsistencies.

Looking at the story, it's structured into chapters: Introduction, The Story, Theories of the Mystery, and Conclusion. Each section seems to follow a logical progression. The Introduction sets up the context about Dickens's writing style and his novel. The Story section provides a detailed summary of the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." Then, the Theories of the Mystery section discusses different interpretations from critics like Forster, Proctor, and Walters, and the author presents their own theory. The conclusion wraps up the analysis.

There are some transitions between sections, and the author refers back to earlier points when discussing different theories. However, I notice that the story sometimes jumps between different theories without clear transitions, and at times, the reader might lose the thread of the argument. The dense academic style and the complexity of the theories might also make the story less accessible to a general reader, potentially affecting its coherence.

Now for Fluency. Fluency refers to how well-written and grammatically correct the text is, as well as how smoothly the sentences flow. I'll look for grammar errors, awkward phrasing, and other issues that might make reading difficult.

Looking at the text, I notice some grammatical issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'"
- [GRAMMAR] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises."
- [GRAMMAR] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or roman policier, careful study of character."
- [GRAMMAR] "We may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour."
- [GRAMMAR] "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the 'atmosphere' of a small cathedral town."
- [GRAMMAR] "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers."
- [GRAMMAR] "Many efforts have am made to decipher his purpose, especially his intentions as to the hero."
- [GRAMMAR] "But he was conspicuously defunct!"
- [GRAMMAR] "From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to dissent."
- [GRAMMAR] "I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a state of tangle."
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, 'that', I never saw 'that' before."
- [GRAMMAR] "He might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires."
- [GRAMMAR] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction."
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories."
- [GRAMMAR] "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is 'Watched by the Dead,' by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)."
- [GRAMMAR] "Of Mr. Proctor’s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a state of tangle."
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, 'that', I never saw 'that' before."
- [GRAMMAR] "He might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires."
- [GRAMMAR] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction."
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories."
- [GRAMMAR] "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is 'Watched by the Dead,' by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)."
- [GRAMMAR] "Of Mr. Proctor’s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a state of tangle."

There are also some awkward phrasings and word choices:
- [LEXICON] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises."
- [LEXICON] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or roman policier, careful study of character."
- [LEXICON] "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a gamin, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of Bleak House."
- [LEXICON] "Opinions may differ as to Edwin and Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks of that character."
- [LEXICON] "As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the restraint which she puts on her 'tigerish blood' is admirable: she is very fresh and original."
- [LEXICON] "The villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think, is the 'atmosphere' of a small cathedral town."
- [LEXICON] "Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the other hand, the opium den is studied from the life."
- [LEXICON] "He threw himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers."
- [LEXICON] "Many efforts have am made to decipher his purpose, especially his intentions as to the hero."
- [LEXICON] "But he was conspicuously defunct!"
- [LEXICON] "From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to dissent."
- [LEXICON] "I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a state of tangle."
- [LEXICON] "He saw in his vision, 'that', I never saw 'that' before."
- [LEXICON] "He might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires."
- [LEXICON] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction."
- [LEXICON] "Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories."
- [LEXICON] "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is 'Watched by the Dead,' by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)."
- [LEXICON] "Of Mr. Proctor’s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a state of tangle."

I also notice some awkward transitions and sentence structures that could be improved for better flow:
- [SYNTAX] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises."
- [SYNTAX] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or roman policier, careful study of character."
