I need to evaluate this story according to the given criteria of Coherence and Fluency, and provide a rating on a scale from 1 to 5 for each. Let me analyze the text carefully.

First, let me understand what the story is about:
This appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an influential American designer and printer. The text is structured as a chapbook with several chapters, telling the story of Bradley's life and career from his early years as a printer's devil to his later years as a respected figure in American design.

Now, let me evaluate the Coherence and Fluency:

**Coherence Evaluation**:
Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, and narrative structure.

Issues with Coherence:
[STRUCTURE] - The story is structured as a biography with several chapters, which is appropriate for the content. However, the transition between chapters is sometimes abrupt, and the overall narrative flow could be improved with better transitional phrases.
[LOGIC] - There are occasional logical gaps in the narrative. For example, some events seem to jump in time without clear chronological markers.
[CLARITY] - The narrative is generally clear, but there are moments where the meaning is ambiguous or the reader has to infer connections between events.
[TRANSITION] - The transitions between chapters and within the narrative are sometimes abrupt, making the flow of the story feel disjointed at times.
[ORGANIZATION] - While the overall structure is chronological, some details are presented in a way that could be better organized for clarity.

**Fluency Evaluation**:
Fluency assesses the quality of the language at the sentence level, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues with Fluency:
[GRAMMAR] - There are several grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "You have move to the section called Swampscott" should be "You have moved..."; "You are now on the “Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston" has incorrect punctuation; "You are now back with R-M stayed half an hour at night" has a grammatical error in tense.
[SYNTAX] - There are some awkward sentence structures. For example: "He discover American colonial typography" should be "He discovered..."; "He may had had some such idea in mind" should be "He may have had..."; "He wanted to be an artist. But the business of Lyon & Healy was musical instruments, not art." has an awkward transition.
[WORD CHOICE] - There are some instances of imprecise or awkward word choices. For example: "He was an inveterate sportsman in a land where game, deer and fish, is plentiful" should be "are plentiful"; "You think it would was fine to be a teamster" should be "would be fine".
[PUNCTUATION] - There are several punctuation errors throughout the text. For example: "He had been a good boy and that when you grow up you will want to be an artist and there will be no money for your education." should have a comma after "boy"; "You are now back with R-M stayed half an hour at night and getting to work a half hour earlier in the morning and all is well with the world." has awkward punctuation.
[CONSISTENCY] - The text alternates between first-person and third-person narration in some sections, which can be confusing for the reader.

Now, let me assign scores based on my evaluation:

For Coherence:
- The story has a clear chronological structure as a biography
- The narrative is generally logical and progresses through Bradley's life
- There are some logical gaps and abrupt transitions that affect coherence
- The narrative is generally clear but could be improved with better transitions
- Score: 3.5 out of 5

For Fluency:
- There are numerous grammatical errors that impact readability
- Some sentence structures are awkward or confusing
- There are issues with word choice and punctuation
- The text shows some variation in narrative perspective (first vs. third person)
- Score: 2.5 out of 5

Rounding to the nearest integer:
FINAL Coherence Score: 4 (The narrative is generally coherent despite some issues with transitions and logical flow)
FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (The text has significant grammatical and syntactical issues that impact readability)

Let me double-check my analysis and refine my scores if needed.

For Coherence:
- The story has a clear chronological structure as a biography
- The narrative is generally logical and progresses through Bradley's life
- There are some logical gaps and abrupt transitions that affect coherence
- The narrative is generally clear but could be improved with better transitions
- Score: 3.5 out of 5

For Fluency:
- There are numerous grammatical errors that impact readability
- Some sentence structures are awkward or confusing
- There are issues with word choice and punctuation
- The text shows some variation in narrative perspective (first vs. third person)
- Score: 2.5 out of 5

After considering my analysis, I would revise my scores slightly:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3 (The narrative is generally coherent but has some issues with transitions and logical flow)
FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (The text has significant grammatical and syntactical issues that impact readability)

Let me finalize my evaluation:

Issues:
[STRUCTURE] - The story is structured as a biography with several chapters, but the transition between chapters is sometimes abrupt, and the overall narrative flow could be improved with better transitional phrases.
[LOGIC] - There are occasional logical gaps in the narrative. For example, some events seem to jump in time without clear chronological markers.
[CLARITY] - The narrative is generally clear, but there are moments where the meaning is ambiguous or the reader has to infer connections between events.
[TRANSITION] - The transitions between chapters and within the narrative are sometimes abrupt, making the flow of the story feel disjointed at times.
[ORGANIZATION] - While the overall structure is chronological, some details are presented in a way that could be better organized for clarity.
[GRAMMAR] - There are several grammatical errors throughout the text.
[SYNTAX] - There are some awkward sentence structures.
[WORD CHOICE] - There are some instances of imprecise or awkward word choices.
[PUNCTUATION] - There are several punctuation errors throughout the text.
[CONSISTENCY] - The text alternates between first-person and third-person narration in some sections, which can be confusing for the reader.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
