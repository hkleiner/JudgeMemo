Alright, let's go through this task step by step. The user has provided a lengthy religious text discussing the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper. My task is to evaluate this text according to the criteria of Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, I need to understand what each criterion entails:

- **Fluency**: This assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

- **Coherence**: This assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. It considers logically sequenced, non-repetitive, and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear the narrative is.

Now, I'll analyze the text for issues in each category.

### Fluency Issues
1. **[GRAMMAR]** There are several grammatical errors throughout the text, such as:
   - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue" (should be "I did this")
   - "we was taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life" (should be "we were taught")
   - "the water was nowhere said to be change into regeneration" (should be "was nowhere said to be changed")
   - "the new birth was not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit" (should be "the new birth is not in the water")

2. **[SPELLING]** There are spelling errors:
   - "was" is used incorrectly in several places where "is" or "are" should be used
   - "was" is used in past tense contexts where present tense is appropriate
   - "was" is used in passive voice where it should be "were" or "has been"

3. **[SYNTAX]** There are syntax errors and awkward phrasing:
   - "But I believed, I am perfectly safe in arranging..." (should be "But I believe, I am perfectly safe")
   - "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." (awkward phrasing)
   - "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth" (awkward and unclear)

4. **[LEXICON]** There are word choice issues:
   - "was" is used incorrectly in many places
   - "was" is used in passive voice where it should be "were" or "has been"
   - "was" is used in past tense contexts where present tense is appropriate

5. **[PUNCTUATION]** There are punctuation errors and inconsistencies:
   - Missing or incorrect use of commas
   - Inconsistent use of quotation marks
   - Missing periods at the end of some sentences

6. **[WORD CHOICE]** There are instances of incorrect word usage:
   - "was" is used incorrectly in many places
   - "was" is used in passive voice where it should be "were" or "has been"
   - "was" is used in past tense contexts where present tense is appropriate

7. **[PHRASING]** There are awkward or unclear phrasings:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" (awkward phrasing)
   - "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." (awkward phrasing)
   - "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth" (awkward and unclear)

8. **[TENSE]** There are issues with tense consistency:
   - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." (should be "I did this")
   - "we was taught by our Lord Himself" (should be "we were taught")
   - "the water was nowhere said to be change into regeneration" (should be "was nowhere said to be changed")
   - "the new birth was not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit" (should be "the new birth is not in the water")

9. **[VOICE]** There are issues with voice consistency:
   - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." (should be "I did this")
   - "we was taught by our Lord Himself" (should be "we were taught")
   - "the water was nowhere said to be change into regeneration" (should be "was nowhere said to be changed")
   - "the new birth was not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit" (should be "the new birth is not in the water")

10. **[CONJUNCTIONS]** There are issues with the use of conjunctions:
    - "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth" (awkward and unclear)

### Coherence Issues
1. **[LOGIC]** There are logical inconsistencies or unclear arguments:
    - The text often makes assertions without providing clear evidence or reasoning to support them
    - Some arguments appear circular or self-referential
    - The text sometimes makes broad claims without providing the necessary context or explanation

2. **[STRUCTURE]** There are structural issues:
    - The text is very long and dense, making it difficult to follow
    - There are long paragraphs without clear organization or transitions
    - The text jumps between different topics without clear connections
    - The structure is not always logical or easy to follow

3. **[CLARITY]** There are clarity issues:
    - The text is often verbose and uses complex language that is difficult to understand
    - Some sentences are too long and convoluted
    - The meaning is sometimes obscured by the density of the text

4. **[TRANSITION]** There are transition issues:
    - The text often moves abruptly from one topic to another without clear transitions
    - There are few signposts or cues to help the reader follow the argument
    - The connections between paragraphs and sections are sometimes unclear

5. **[CONSISTENCY]** There are consistency issues:
    - The text sometimes contradicts itself
    - There are inconsistencies in the use of terms and concepts
    - The text sometimes uses the same terms to refer to different concepts

6. **[FOCUS]** There are focus issues:
    - The text sometimes drifts off-topic or becomes sidetracked
    - There are long digressions that don't directly support the main argument
    - The main argument is sometimes obscured by the sheer volume of information

7. **[ORGANIZATION]** There are organization issues:
    - The text is not always well-organized
    - The flow of ideas is sometimes disjointed
    - The structure is not always logical or easy to follow

8. **[PACING]** There are pacing issues:
    - The text is often too dense and moves too quickly through complex ideas
    - There are long stretches of text without adequate explanation or context
    - The text sometimes moves too slowly through simple ideas

9. **[COHESION]** There are cohesion issues:
    - The text is not always cohesive
    - There are long paragraphs without clear organization or connections
    - The text sometimes jumps between ideas without clear connections

10. **[PROGRESSION]** There are progression issues:
    - The text sometimes lacks a clear progression of ideas
    - There are long stretches of text without a clear direction or purpose
    - The text sometimes moves in a circular or repetitive manner

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation:

### Fluency Score
The text has numerous grammatical, spelling, syntax, and word choice issues. The use of "was" in many places is incorrect, and there are many other grammatical errors. The phrasing is often awkward, and the punctuation is inconsistent. The tense and voice are not always consistent. Given these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2 out of 5.

### Coherence Score
The text is very long and dense, with long paragraphs and a lack of clear organization. The logic is sometimes unclear, and the arguments are not always well-supported. The transitions between ideas are often abrupt, and the text sometimes jumps from one topic to another without clear connections. The structure is not always logical or easy to follow. Given these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 2 out of 5.
