I'll analyze the provided story and rate it according to the evaluation criteria for coherence and fluency.

First, let me examine the story for coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE]: The story is a biography of Will Bradley, presented in a series of chapters. The structure is generally clear, with a chronological progression from his childhood to his retirement.
- [LOGIC]: The narrative follows a logical progression through Bradley's life and career. There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship in many parts of the story.
- [CLARITY]: The story is generally clear, though some parts could be more concise.
- [TRANSITION]: The transitions between chapters are generally smooth, though some could be improved to better connect different phases of Bradley's life.
- [REPETITION]: There is some repetition of information about Bradley's work and career in different chapters.
- [AMBIGUITY]: There are a few instances of ambiguity, particularly in some of the more descriptive passages.
- [PACING]: The story has a good overall pace, though some sections are quite lengthy.

Now for fluency issues:
- [GRAMMAR]: There are some grammatical errors throughout the text.
- [SPELLING]: There are several spelling errors in the text.
- [SYNTAX]: The syntax is generally correct, though some sentences are quite long and complex.
- [LEXICON]: The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter, though some words are misspelled.
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are some punctuation errors throughout the text.
- [PHRASING]: Some phrases are awkward or could be more natural.

Let me provide specific examples of the issues:

Issues:
[GRAMMAR] - There are several grammatical errors such as "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to ghe sun and air." (should be "opened to the sun and air")

[SPELLING] - There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text such as "dtartling" instead of "dartling", "tme" instead of "time", "tkme" instead of "time", "idda" instead of "idea", "vast indifference" should be "vast indifference", "tovwhich" should be "to which", etc.

[SYNTAX] - Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, such as "He may have had some such idda in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work."

[PUNCTUATION] - There are several punctuation errors such as missing commas, missing periods, and incorrect use of hyphens.

[REPETITION] - Some information about Bradley's work and career is repeated in different chapters.

[LOGIC] - While the overall narrative is logical, some transitions between chapters could be smoother.

[CLARITY] - Some parts of the text could be more clear, particularly in the descriptive passages.

[TRANSITION] - Some transitions between chapters are abrupt, particularly between the early chapters and the later career chapters.

[PHRASING] - Some phrases are awkward or could be more natural, such as "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body, and it thrilled him to speak to thousands, even millions, instead of just scores."

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence and fluency of the story:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3 (The story has a clear narrative structure and logical progression, but could benefit from smoother transitions and less repetition)

FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (The story has numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors that affect readability, and some awkward phrasing)
