Alright, let me analyze this story according to the evaluation criteria provided. The task is to rate the story for Coherence and Fluency on a scale from 1 to 5, and to identify specific issues that affect these scores.

First, I'll read through the story to understand its content and structure. The story is a theological text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's a detailed and formal analysis of the Church's teachings, comparing them to Roman Catholic doctrine and addressing controversies surrounding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

Now, let's evaluate the Coherence of the story:

Coherence refers to how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure. It should be non-repetitive and avoid ambiguities or abrupt jumps.

Issues with Coherence:
1. [STRUCTURE]: The story is extremely long and dense, making it challenging to follow the logical progression of ideas without losing the thread.
2. [LOGIC]: While the argument is generally logical, there are moments where the reasoning jumps from one concept to another without sufficient explanation.
3. [CLARITY]: Some sections are overly complex and use archaic language that makes the meaning less clear to modern readers.
4. [TRANSITION]: There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections that could benefit from smoother connections.
5. [REPETITION]: There is some repetition of points, particularly in the sections about the Articles of the Church.

Now, let's evaluate the Fluency of the story:

Fluency refers to how well the text reads at the sentence level, focusing on grammar, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Issues with Fluency:
1. [GRAMMAR]: There are several grammatical errors throughout the text, including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect prepositions.
2. [SPELLING]: There are spelling errors such as "ans" instead of "and", "vlindly" instead of "blindly", "experiejced" instead of "experienced", and "het" instead of "yet".
3. [SYNTAX]: The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the meaning at times.
4. [LEXICON]: The text uses archaic and complex vocabulary that may be challenging for modern readers.
5. [PUNCTUATION]: There are instances of inconsistent or missing punctuation that disrupt the flow of the text.

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores for both Coherence and Fluency.

For Coherence:
The text presents a clear argument and has a logical structure, but the density of content and occasional abrupt transitions make it challenging to follow. The repetition of some points also affects the overall coherence. I would rate this as a 3.

For Fluency:
The text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and complex sentence structures that make it difficult to read smoothly. The archaic language and inconsistent punctuation further reduce fluency. I would rate this as a 2.

Let me review my analysis to ensure I've captured the key issues and assigned appropriate scores.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors throughout the text (e.g., "ans" instead of "and", "vlindly" instead of "blindly", "experiejced" instead of "experienced", "het" instead of "yet")  
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors in the text (e.g., "Docteine" instead of "Doctrine", "iur" instead of "our", "thr" instead of "the")  
- [SYNTAX] Complex and sometimes convoluted sentence structures that make the text difficult to follow  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic and complex vocabulary that may be challenging for modern readers  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense with information, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas  
- [LOGIC] While the argument is generally logical, there are moments where the reasoning jumps from one concept to another without sufficient explanation  
- [CLARITY] Some sections use archaic language and complex phrasing that reduces clarity for modern readers  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections that could benefit from smoother connections  
- [REPETITION] Some repetition of points, particularly in the sections about the Church's teachings  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
