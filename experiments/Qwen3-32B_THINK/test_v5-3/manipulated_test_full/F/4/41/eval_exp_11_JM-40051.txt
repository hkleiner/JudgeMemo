Okay, let me start by carefully reading the user's instructions and the story provided. The task is to evaluate the story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. I need to identify specific issues in the text under their respective categories and then assign scores.

First, I'll go through the story and look for problems related to Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and clarity of the narrative. The story seems to be a detailed account of someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location. The author uses a lot of geographical and biblical references. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, if there are any abrupt jumps, and if the narrative is consistent.

Looking at the structure, the story starts with the author's discovery and then moves into a detailed description of the location, comparing it to biblical descriptions. However, there are several sections where the flow is disrupted. For example, the author frequently shifts between describing the geography and making biblical comparisons without clear transitions. There are also repetitive points about the rivers and the garden's features. Additionally, some parts seem to be digressions, like the discussion about the dairying industry, which might not be directly relevant to the main argument. These could be [LOGIC] issues because the logical progression isn't always clear, and [STRUCTURE] problems due to the lack of smooth transitions.

Now, moving to Fluency, which focuses on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The story has several typos and misspellings. For instance, "thr earth" instead of "the earth," "tje antldiluvians" instead of "the antediluvians," "giverca description" instead of "give a description," "he could not point it out to them—and as the country..." (run-on sentence), and "have become sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is thebgarden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled..." The use of incorrect words like "bgarden" instead of "garden" and "llace" instead of "place" are [SPELLING] errors. There are also [SYNTAX] issues with run-on sentences and incorrect punctuation. For example, "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." The comma splice here is a [SYNTAX] problem. Additionally, the author uses non-standard contractions and inconsistent capitalization, which could be [LEXICON] or [SYNTAX] issues.

I should also check for coherence problems. The story sometimes jumps between different points without clear connections. For example, after discussing the geographical features, the author suddenly brings up a historical anecdote about a lawyer and a devil, which seems out of place. This is a [LOGIC] issue. There are also instances where the narrative becomes overly detailed and repetitive, such as the repeated emphasis on the four rivers and the garden's features, which could be [CLARITY] issues because it makes the main argument harder to follow.

For Fluency, the text has numerous spelling errors like "belkeve" instead of "believe," "watercthe garden" instead of "water the garden," "thence," instead of "thence," and "mter" instead of "matter." There are also misspellings in names and places, such as "Heald’s quarry" with incorrect punctuation and "Trempealeau" with inconsistent spelling. These are all [SPELLING] issues. The use of incorrect words like "sensibly impressed" instead of "sensibly impressed" might be a [LEXICON] issue. Additionally, there are grammatical errors like subject-verb agreement and incorrect verb tenses. For example, "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity..." should be "The discovery resulted from..." (missing article). Also, "I have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have discovered them, and belkeve the reader will be pleased..." has a missing comma and a spelling error in "belkeve."

In terms of coherence, the story's structure is somewhat disjointed. It starts with the author's discovery, then moves into a detailed geographical description, followed by biblical references, then a detour into dairying and geological data, and finally ends with a call to action. The transitions between these sections are abrupt, which could be [TRANSITION] issues. The author also uses a lot of repetition, such as repeatedly stating that the location matches the biblical description, which might be [STRUCTURE] or [LOGIC] issues because it doesn't add new information and can confuse the reader.

For Fluency, the text has run-on sentences and fragmented sentences. For example, "It is located on the “eastward bank” of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names." The first sentence is a run-on, and the second is a fragment. There are also instances of incorrect punctuation, such as missing commas in lists and incorrect use of hyphens. Additionally, the author uses archaic or non-standard phrasing, which might be a [LEXICON] issue, such as "O what a delightful home!" which is an exclamation mark used incorrectly in the context.

After identifying these issues, I need to assign scores. For Coherence, the story has some logical flow and structure issues, but the main argument is somewhat clear. However, the frequent digressions and lack of smooth transitions would lower the score. Maybe a 3. For Fluency, the numerous spelling and grammatical errors, along with syntax problems, would significantly impact readability. The story is difficult to read due to these errors, so a 2 might be appropriate.

Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent logical flow with abrupt shifts between geographical descriptions and biblical comparisons.  
- [STRUCTURE] Poorly organized sections with repetitive emphasis on the four rivers and garden features.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "Eden" and "garden" without clear contextual anchors.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between unrelated topics (e.g., dairying industry, geological data).  
- [SPELLING] Numerous typos: "thr earth," "tje antldiluvians," "llace," "bgarden," "belkeve."  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and comma splices: "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery... and commenced developing the facts about it."  
- [LEXICON] Misused words: "sensibly impressed," "watercthe garden," "mter."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas, incorrect hyphens, and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Heald’s quarry," "Trempealeau").  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
