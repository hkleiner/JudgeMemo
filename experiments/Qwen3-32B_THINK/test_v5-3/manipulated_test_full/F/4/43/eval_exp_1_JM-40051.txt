I need to evaluate the given story according to the two metrics: coherence and fluency.

First, let me understand the story and identify any issues:

This is a lengthy article claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley between La Crosse, Wisconsin and Winona, Minnesota. The author presents various geographical and biblical arguments to support this claim.

Let me analyze the text for coherence and fluency issues:

Coherence issues:
- The narrative is disjointed and lacks a clear structure or logical progression.
- There are numerous abrupt shifts in focus and perspective.
- Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous content.
- The argumentation is repetitive and lacks a clear thesis development.
- The text jumps between descriptive passages, historical claims, and personal observations without clear transitions.
- There's an overuse of geographical descriptions without a clear purpose or narrative thread.
- The author frequently makes grandiose claims without sufficient supporting evidence or logical connections.

Fluency issues:
- There are numerous spelling errors (e.g., "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians").
- There are grammatical errors and sentence fragments.
- Some sentences are extremely long and convoluted.
- There are instances of awkward phrasing and non-standard word order.
- The text contains many run-on sentences and comma splices.
- Some words are misused or used in non-standard ways.
- There are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation.

Let me now systematically list the issues according to the requested categories:

Issues:
[STRUCTURE] The text lacks a coherent structure. It appears to be a collection of loosely connected observations and arguments without a clear narrative flow or organization.
[LOGIC] The argumentation is weak and illogical at times. The author makes grand claims without sufficient evidence or logical connections between premises and conclusions.
[CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing. The author uses complex and sometimes obscure language without sufficient explanation.
[TRANSITION] There are few effective transitions between paragraphs and ideas. The text often jumps abruptly from one topic to another without clear connections.
[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text.
[SYNTAX] The syntax is often awkward and unnatural, with many run-on sentences and non-standard constructions.
[SPELLING] There are multiple spelling errors in the text.
[LEXICON] The text contains several instances of word misuse or non-standard vocabulary usage.
[COHERENCE] The overall narrative lacks coherence. The text reads more like a disjointed collection of observations than a unified argument.
[ORGANIZATION] The text is poorly organized. The author appears to be jumping from one idea to another without clear organization or progression.
[ARGUMENTATION] The argumentation is weak. The author makes many claims without sufficient evidence or logical support.
[CONCISENESS] The text is unnecessarily verbose and repetitive in places.

Now, let me assign scores based on these observations:

For Coherence (how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and consistent and clear structure):
- The text has significant coherence problems. While the author has a central claim (that the Garden of Eden is in the Mississippi River valley), the presentation of this claim is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative or logical progression.
- The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions and lacks a coherent structure.
- The argumentation is weak and the author frequently makes grandiose claims without sufficient supporting evidence or logical connections.

Given these issues, I would rate the Coherence as a 2 (very low).

For Fluency (how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences, ensuring that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors):
- The text has numerous fluency issues. There are many spelling errors, grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and non-standard constructions.
- The sentences are often long and convoluted, making the text difficult to read.
- The author frequently uses complex and sometimes obscure language without sufficient explanation.

Given these issues, I would rate the Fluency as a 2 (very low).

Let me now finalize my evaluation:

Issues:
[STRUCTURE] The text lacks a coherent structure and clear organization.
[LOGIC] The argumentation is weak and often illogical.
[CLARITY] The text is frequently unclear and confusing.
[TRANSITION] There are few effective transitions between ideas.
[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors.
[SYNTAX] The syntax is often awkward and unnatural.
[SPELLING] There are multiple spelling errors.
[COHERENCE] The overall narrative lacks coherence.
[ARGUMENTATION] The argumentation is weak and unsupported.
[CONCISENESS] The text is unnecessarily verbose and repetitive in places.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
