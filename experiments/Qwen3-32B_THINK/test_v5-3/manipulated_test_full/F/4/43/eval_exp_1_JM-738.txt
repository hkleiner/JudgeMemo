Let me carefully analyze the provided story text to evaluate it according to the criteria of Coherence and Fluency.

First, I'll understand what each criterion means:
- Coherence: How well the story unfolds as a whole, with logical sequencing, clear progression, and consistent structure.
- Fluency: How smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Now, I'll examine the story for issues under each category:

Issues with Coherence:
1. [LOGIC] The story has complex plot elements that may be difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the historical context of Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."
2. [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between multiple characters and perspectives without clear transitions, making it challenging to follow the narrative flow.
3. [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are ambiguous, particularly regarding the relationships between characters and the exact sequence of events.
4. [LOGIC] The story presents multiple theories about what happened to Edwin Drood, but the connections between these theories and the main narrative are not always clear.
5. [COHERENCE] The story attempts to analyze and solve the mystery of Dickens's unfinished novel, but the various theories and interpretations sometimes contradict each other.

Issues with Fluency:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including incorrect subject-verb agreement, misplaced modifiers, and other syntactic issues.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, with long, complex sentences that are difficult to parse.
3. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, particularly in the more complex vocabulary.
4. [PUNCTUATION] Punctuation is frequently used incorrectly, including missing commas, incorrect use of quotation marks, and other punctuation errors.
5. [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the academic analysis of literature, but some word choices are awkward or imprecise.
6. [PHRASING] Some phrases are awkward or unidiomatic, making the text feel unnatural.
7. [COHESION] The text sometimes lacks smooth transitions between ideas, making the reading experience choppy.

Now I'll rate the story on the 1-5 scale for each criterion:

For Coherence:
The story has an overall structure as an analysis of Dickens's novel, but the complexity of the content, the multiple theories presented, and the lack of clear transitions between sections make it difficult to follow. The text attempts to solve a literary mystery but often gets bogged down in its own complexity. I would rate this as a 2/5.

For Fluency:
The text is riddled with grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation throughout. While the vocabulary is generally appropriate for the subject matter, the frequent errors and awkward constructions make the text difficult to read. I would rate this as a 2/5.

Let me now provide a more detailed evaluation of the issues.

Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story is a complex analysis of Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" that presents multiple theories about the plot and characters, but the logical connections between these theories are often unclear or contradictory.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different sections and theories without clear transitions, making it challenging to follow the overall structure.
- [CLARITY] Many parts of the text are ambiguous or unclear, particularly regarding the relationships between characters and the exact sequence of events in the story.
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect subject-verb agreement, misplaced modifiers, and other syntactic issues.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is frequently convoluted, with long, complex sentences that are difficult to parse.
- [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, particularly in the more complex vocabulary.
- [PUNCTUATION] Punctuation is frequently used incorrectly, including missing commas, incorrect use of quotation marks, and other punctuation errors.
- [LEXICON] While the vocabulary is generally appropriate for the academic analysis of literature, some word choices are awkward or imprecise.
- [PHRASING] Some phrases are awkward or unidiomatic, making the text feel unnatural.
- [COHESION] The text sometimes lacks smooth transitions between ideas, making the reading experience choppy.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
