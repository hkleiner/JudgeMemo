Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on two criteria: Coherence and Fluency. The user wants me to list issues under specific categories and then assign scores from 1 to 5 for each metric.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of its content. The story is a theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Eucharist, specifically addressing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. It's quite dense with religious terminology and references to church documents like Articles, Catechism, and Homilies.

Now, for Coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure. I need to check if the arguments are presented in a logical order, if there are any abrupt jumps or ambiguities, and if the narrative is consistent.

Looking at the story, it's structured into chapters and sections, each tackling a specific aspect (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). Each section starts with an introduction, presents arguments from church documents, and refutes opposing views. However, some parts are quite long and dense, which might make it hard to follow. There are moments where the flow seems to jump between different points without smooth transitions. For example, in the section on the Catechism, the argumentation shifts abruptly from discussing the Catechism's content to comparing it with the Articles. Also, some paragraphs are very lengthy, which can disrupt the logical flow and make it harder to track the argument.

Next, Fluency. This focuses on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation at the sentence level. I need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or unclear expressions.

Looking at the text, there are several instances of awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." is a clear grammatical error and makes no sense. There's also a line that reads "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far." which is confusing. Other examples include "All and is by communicant true all really we, enjoyed real, teach is a this they gift believe there; the devout received and thankfully that." These sentences are jumbled and lack proper structure. Additionally, some sentences have incorrect word order or missing words, which affects readability. For instance, "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour." is a run-on sentence with missing words and incorrect structure. There are also instances of misspellings or incorrect word choices, such as "It may seem strange at first sight that any persons should be eager to maintain that the wicked receive so sacred a gift as the body and blood of our blessed Saviour; but a very slight reflection will show the reason, for on this question hinges the whole controversy." Here, "maintain that the wicked receive" might be better phrased for clarity.

Now, listing the issues with appropriate labels:

For Coherence:
- [STRUCTURE]: The story is divided into chapters and sections, but some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, making the flow of ideas less smooth.
- [LOGIC]: Some arguments jump between points without clear connections, which can confuse the reader.
- [CLARITY]: Certain sections are overly dense and lack clear explanations, making it difficult to follow the reasoning.
- [TRANSITION]: There are instances where the shift from one topic to another is not well signaled, leading to a disjointed reading experience.

For Fluency:
- [GRAMMAR]: There are multiple grammatical errors, such as incorrect sentence structures and missing words.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, leading to confusion.
- [SPELLING]: While spelling seems mostly correct, there are instances of jumbled words or incorrect word order.
- [LEXICON]: Some word choices are unclear or inappropriate for the context.
- [PUNCTUATION]: Incorrect or missing punctuation contributes to the confusion in several sentences.

Now, assigning the scores. For Coherence, despite the structured approach, the abrupt transitions and dense sections lower the score. I'd give a 3. For Fluency, the numerous grammatical and syntactical issues significantly impact readability, so a 2 is appropriate.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as incomplete or fragmented sentences (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing disrupts readability, e.g., "Thus all, I agreed, presume are we far" and "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour."  
- [SPELLING] Jumbled words and incorrect word order, e.g., "All and is by communicant true all really we, enjoyed real, teach is a this they gift believe there."  
- [LOGIC] Arguments sometimes lack clear logical progression, e.g., abrupt shifts between discussing the Catechism and the Articles without explicit connections.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lengthy, dense paragraphs and sections make the narrative feel disjointed, with unclear transitions between ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex or ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "the memorialists already referred to, say, ‘We repudiate all adoration of a corporal presence…’") obscures meaning.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., run-on sentences like "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour") further hinders readability.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
