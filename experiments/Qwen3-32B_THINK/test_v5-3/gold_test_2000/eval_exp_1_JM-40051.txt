Let me analyze the story to identify issues related to coherence and fluency.

First, I'll identify issues with coherence (how well the story unfolds as a whole):

1. [LOGIC] The narrative is somewhat disjointed. The author presents a theory about the Garden of Eden being located in a specific geographical area in the United States, but the logical connections between the evidence and the conclusion are weak.

2. [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative structure. It jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. The author begins with an introduction about being slow to publish, then discusses biblical references, then geographical descriptions, then back to biblical interpretations.

3. [CLARITY] The author often makes sweeping claims without sufficient evidence or logical progression. For example, they assert that the Garden of Eden is in this specific location in the US but don't provide a clear, step-by-step argument to support this conclusion.

4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt. The story lacks smooth transitions that would help the reader follow the author's line of reasoning.

5. [LOGIC] The author makes several leaps of logic. For example, they claim that because the Mississippi River is long and picturesque, it must be the biblical Euphrates. This is a weak argument that lacks supporting evidence.

Now for issues with fluency (how well the text reads sentence by sentence):

1. [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text. For example, "have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject after "having become thoroughly satisfied."

2. [SPELLING] There are spelling errors such as "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "jageed" (should be "jagged").

3. [SYNTAX] The syntax is often awkward or confusing. For example, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it" is missing a subject for the second verb.

4. [LEXICON] There are instances of word choice that seem inappropriate or awkward. For example, "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" has an awkward structure.

5. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often incorrect or missing. For example, "And this hanging garden has been notable and notorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their Indian name 'rattlesnake hills,' and including Mount Trempealeau, (a separate and distinct pyramid) was formerly 'Literally alive with rattlesnakes.'" has incorrect punctuation and capitalization.

6. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are run-on or have awkward structures. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere" has unnecessary commas and awkward phrasing.

7. [SPELLING] There are other spelling issues like "Bridtish" (should be "British"), "antideluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "commencing more than half way up the mound" (should be "commences more than half way up the mound").

8. [PUNCTUATION] The use of em dashes and other punctuation is inconsistent and sometimes confusing.

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Coherence (how the story unfolds as a whole):
- The narrative is somewhat disjointed and lacks clear logical progression
- The structure is weak with abrupt transitions
- The argument is not well-developed with many logical leaps
- The overall organization is not clear or consistent

Score: 2/5

For Fluency (how the text reads sentence by sentence):
- There are numerous grammatical errors
- Several spelling mistakes
- Awkward syntax and sentence structure
- Punctuation issues throughout the text
- Some awkward word choices

Score: 2/5

Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative is disjointed with weak logical connections between evidence and conclusions about the Garden of Eden's location.
- [STRUCTURE] Lacks clear narrative structure, jumping between ideas without smooth transitions.
- [CLARITY] Makes sweeping claims without sufficient evidence or logical progression.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas.
- [LOGIC] Weak logical leaps, e.g., equating Mississippi River with Euphrates based on length and picturesque qualities.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing subjects in sentences (e.g., "have ventured to publish it").
- [SPELLING] Errors like "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "jageed."
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible").
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate or awkward word choices.
- [PUNCTUATION] Incorrect or missing punctuation throughout.
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and awkward structures.
- [SPELLING] Additional errors like "Bridtish," "antideluvians."
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em dashes and other punctuation.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
