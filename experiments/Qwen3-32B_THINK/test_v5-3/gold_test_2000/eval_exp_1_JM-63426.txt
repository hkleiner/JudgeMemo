Okay, let's start by reading through the provided story and the evaluation instructions carefully. The task is to assess the story's Coherence and Fluency on a 1-5 scale, noting specific issues in each category.

First, I'll focus on Coherence. Coherence relates to how well the story flows as a whole, the logical sequence of events, and how smoothly ideas connect. The story has two chapters. The first is an introduction by someone else about Will Bradley, and the second is a narrative about his early life. 

I notice that the second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," is written in the second person, addressing the reader as "you" and "Willie," which is unusual compared to the first chapter's third-person narrative. This shift in perspective might confuse readers and disrupt the coherence. Also, the transition from the introduction to the personal story is abrupt, with no clear connection between the two chapters. The first chapter discusses Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, while the second chapter is a detailed, almost episodic account of his childhood. The lack of a smooth transition could make the story feel disjointed.

Looking at the content of the second chapter, the narrative jumps from event to event with minimal explanation. For example, the story moves from Willie's early experiences in Lynn to moving to Swampscott, then to Boston, and then to Northern Michigan. These transitions are not clearly explained, which might make it hard to follow the timeline and the reasons for each move. Additionally, some events are described in great detail (like the candy jars and the school picnic) while others are mentioned briefly, leading to an uneven pacing that affects coherence.

Now, checking for Fluency. Fluency is about the smoothness of the language, grammar, spelling, and syntax. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues. 

In the first paragraph of the second chapter, there's a sentence: "The blackboard is covered with chalk drawings: sailboats, steamboats, ferryboats, trains of cars, houses, people and animals." The colon is used correctly here, but the list might be better with a comma before "and animals" if following a serial comma style. However, this isn't a major issue. 

Another example is the sentence: "He brings you a box of pi." The word "pi" is likely a typo for "type" or "type pi" (printing type), which is a common term in printing. This is a spelling/word choice issue. 

There's also the sentence: "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." The term "Narrow Gauge" is in quotes but it's unclear what it refers to without context, which might confuse readers. If it's a specific train line or method of travel, a brief explanation could help. 

In the section about the Iron Agitator, the sentence: "The two jobbers are kicked." The term "jobbers" here is unclear. It might be a typo for "jobbers" or a specific term in printing, but without explanation, it's ambiguous. 

Looking at punctuation, there's a question mark in the middle of a sentence: "heated (?) with one stove." This seems like a placeholder or a note to the author, which shouldn't be in the final text. 

The sentence: "He is a fine man and you like him and he likes you--but of course you can’t expect him to pay for your art education." The use of the em dash here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit long and could be split for better readability. 

Overall, the story is well-written with rich details, but there are a few instances of unclear terms, abrupt transitions between chapters, and a mix of detailed and brief event descriptions that affect both Coherence and Fluency.

Issues:  
- [COHERENCE] Abrupt transition between the introductory chapter (third-person analysis of Will Bradley's impact) and the second-person narrative of his childhood, creating a disjointed structure.  
- [COHERENCE] Uneven pacing in the second chapter: overly detailed descriptions of minor events (e.g., candy jars, school picnic) contrast with abrupt jumps between locations and life stages (Lynn to Swampscott to Boston to Ishpeming) without clear contextual links.  
- [COHERENCE] Lack of narrative arc in the second chapter; episodic vignettes feel unconnected to Bradley’s later career or the themes introduced in the first chapter.  
- [FLUENCY] Ambiguous phrasing: "He brings you a box of pi" (likely a typo for "type" or "printing type," but unclear without context).  
- [FLUENCY] Unclear terminology: "The two jobbers are kicked" (reference to "jobbers" in printing is obscure without explanation).  
- [FLUENCY] Inconsistent punctuation: "heated (?) with one stove" (question mark appears to be a note to the author, not part of the text).  
- [FLUENCY] Awkward syntax: "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston" (unclear reference to "Narrow Gauge" without definition).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
