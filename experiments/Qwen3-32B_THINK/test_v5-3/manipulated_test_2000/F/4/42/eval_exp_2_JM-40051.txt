Alright, let me look at the story and evaluate it for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

[GRAMMAR] - The story contains numerous grammatical errors. For example, "had venture to published it" should be "had ventured to publish it", "It should was sought" should be "It should be sought", "I is ignorant" should be "I was ignorant", etc.

[SYNTAX] - There are many syntactic issues that make the sentences awkward or confusing. For example, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I had a reasonable thing of it, had venture to published it" is a run-on sentence with incorrect syntax.

[SPACING] - There are strange spacing issues in the text, such as "am opening" where it should be "an opening", "am plainly" where it should be "is plainly", "was being effaced" where it should be "is being effaced".

[LEXICON] - There are inappropriate word choices, such as "was being effaced" where "is being effaced" would be correct, or "was in the form of a new moon" where "is in the form" would be correct.

[PUNCTUATION] - The punctuation is often incorrect or missing. For example, "And this hung garden has been notable and notorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their Indian name 'rattlesnake hills,' and included Mount Trempealeau, (a separate and distinct pyramid) was formerly 'Literally alive with rattlesnakes.'" This sentence has multiple punctuation issues.

**Coherence Issues:**

[LOGIC] - The story jumps from one idea to another without clear connections. For example, it starts with the author's discovery and then moves to a discussion of the Garden of Eden in the Bible, then to geographical features, then to the discovery of rattlesnakes, etc., without clear transitions.

[STRUCTURE] - The story lacks a clear structure. It starts with a claim of discovery, then moves to a discussion of biblical history, then to geography, then to the author's personal experience, etc., without a clear narrative arc.

[CLARITY] - The story is often unclear in its meaning. For example, "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hung garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This was the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, is altogether too large." This paragraph is confusing and lacks clarity.

[TRANSITION] - The transitions between ideas are often abrupt or missing. The story moves from one topic to another without clear transitions.

[REPETITION] - There is significant repetition of ideas and phrases, such as repeated references to the Garden of Eden and its supposed location.

[INCONSISTENCY] - The story is inconsistent in its claims and descriptions. For example, it starts by saying the author was slow to make public the discovery but then describes the discovery in great detail.

[ANACHRONISM] - There are anachronisms, such as references to modern elements like "electric towers" in a text that otherwise seems to be set in a historical context.

Now, let me assign scores for fluency and coherence:

For **Fluency**, I would give a score of 1 out of 5. The text is filled with grammatical errors, syntactic issues, and inappropriate word choices that make it very difficult to read and understand.

For **Coherence**, I would also give a score of 1 out of 5. The story lacks a clear structure, logical progression, and clarity. It jumps from one idea to another without clear connections, and the narrative is often confusing and repetitive.

Let me double-check to ensure I've captured all the issues and made appropriate scores.

The story has significant issues with grammar, syntax, word choice, and punctuation that make it difficult to read (Fluency: 1). The narrative lacks a clear structure, logical progression, and clarity, with many abrupt transitions and jumps between ideas (Coherence: 1).

I'll now format my answer as requested.
