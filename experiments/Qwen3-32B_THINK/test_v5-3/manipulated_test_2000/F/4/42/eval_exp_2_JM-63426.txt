Alright, let me start by carefully reading and understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story on two metrics: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5. I'll identify specific issues in each category and then assign scores.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. It's an introduction to a chap book about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist. The story begins with an introduction chapter, then moves to "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," detailing Bradley's early life and career. The narrative is written in the second person, creating a personal and engaging tone.

Now, I'll analyze for Fluency issues. Fluency is about how the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, word choice, punctuation, and phrasing. I'll look for any errors or awkward phrasing.

Issues in Fluency:
1. [GRAMMAR] "It shoulded be talked about" - "shoulded" is incorrect; should be "should be."
2. [GRAMMAR] "hard to realized" - "realized" should be "realize."
3. [GRAMMAR] "am know" - should be "were known."
4. [GRAMMAR] "barriers being demolish everywhere" - should be "demolished."
5. [GRAMMAR] "It may had had some such idea" - should be "may have had."
6. [GRAMMAR] "it don’t worked" - should be "didn't work."
7. [GRAMMAR] "it thrill him to spoke" - should be "thrilled him to speak."
8. [GRAMMAR] "The turbulent current... appeal to him" - should be "appealed."
9. [GRAMMAR] "So he enormously enriched" - "enormously" is awkward here; "enriched it enormously" would be better.
10. [GRAMMAR] "He was a native, corn-feed American" - "corn-fed" is the correct spelling.
11. [GRAMMAR] "You are the artist. Your mamma... is sitting" - "mamma" is archaic and inconsistent with the rest of the text.
12. [GRAMMAR] "Most of the work is do by hand" - should be "done."
13. [GRAMMAR] "you would be seven" - should be "you will be seven" or "you were seven."
14. [GRAMMAR] "you are paid five cents" - should be "were paid."
15. [GRAMMAR] "It is use to stamp date lines" - should be "used."
16. [GRAMMAR] "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." - "pi" is likely a typo for "type."
17. [GRAMMAR] "Your father is ill, an aftermath of the Civil War" - should be "an aftereffect."
18. [GRAMMAR] "You have moved to the section called Swampscott. This is too far away for you to attend the school to which your class has gone." - "attend the school to which your class has gone" is awkward phrasing.
19. [GRAMMAR] "He tells you he hasn’t long to live, said you have been a good boy" - should be "and says" or rephrased for clarity.
20. [GRAMMAR] "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'" - should be "were."
21. [GRAMMAR] "It will be made to lasted" - should be "last."
22. [GRAMMAR] "You was on your way to Northern Michigan" - should be "were."
23. [GRAMMAR] "You went to school for a few weeks. On circus day you are allowed to have a vacation" - tense inconsistency.
24. [GRAMMAR] "You asked her to wait for you. She promises" - tense inconsistency.
25. [GRAMMAR] "You are now quite grown up, nearly ten. At a Sunday-school picnic you tell the little girl you are someday went back" - should be "will go back."
26. [GRAMMAR] "You asked her to wait for you. She promises" - tense inconsistency.
27. [GRAMMAR] "You now have a step-father. He was a fine man" - tense inconsistency.
28. [GRAMMAR] "Teacher says, 'Took your books and went home'" - should be "Take your books and go home."
29. [GRAMMAR] "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway" - should be "anyway" or "anyhow" but the placement is awkward.
30. [GRAMMAR] "You may I go to work" - should be "May I go to work?"
31. [GRAMMAR] "Your mother was troubled. Finally she says" - tense inconsistency.
32. [GRAMMAR] "You are put to worked washing-up a Gordon press" - should be "work washing up."
33. [GRAMMAR] "There is power, a small engine mount on an upright boiler" - should be "mounted."
34. [GRAMMAR] "The two jobbers are kicked" - unclear; possibly a typo or incomplete sentence.
35. [GRAMMAR] "Had half an hour of leisure you learned the lay" - awkward phrasing.
36. [GRAMMAR] "You are now a worked man" - should be "worker."
37. [GRAMMAR] "Country newspaper shops train and used local help" - tense inconsistency.
38. [GRAMMAR] "When the Iron Ore job printer leaves you are sorry. He has am a kind and patient teacher" - should be "has been."
39. [GRAMMAR] "You are now twelve. Mr. Newett employs a new devil and you set jobs, advertising display, make up the paper and was responsible" - should be "were responsible."
40. [GRAMMAR] "You went to worked at seven and quit at six" - should be "work."
41. [GRAMMAR] "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts... to got kindling" - should be "get."
42. [GRAMMAR] "The Peninsula Record, across the street, was a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time" - tense inconsistency.
43. [GRAMMAR] "He offered you eight dollars a week. You are not that important" - tense inconsistency.
44. [GRAMMAR] "In a few months Iron Ore moves into a new store-building. You are now thirteen" - tense inconsistency.
45. [GRAMMAR] "At fourteen this wage is increased to twelve. At fifteen you are spoken of as foreman" - tense inconsistency.
46. [GRAMMAR] "All editors warn them to keep away. Iron Ore print shop is on the ground floor" - tense inconsistency.
47. [GRAMMAR] "It is nearly nine o'clock on a Friday night--'make-up' time. Mr. Newett has written his last sheets of copy and is reading proof" - tense inconsistency.
48. [GRAMMAR] "At the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap" - tense inconsistency.

That's a significant number of grammatical issues that affect the fluency of the text. There are also some awkward phrasings and inconsistencies in tense that need to be addressed.

Now for Coherence. Coherence is about how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, and consistency.

Issues in Coherence:
1. [LOGIC] The story jumps from the introduction to the boyhood of Will Bradley without clear transition.
2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is somewhat disjointed, with the introduction chapter followed by the boyhood chapter but no clear connection between them.
3. [CLARITY] Some events are described in a confusing manner. For example, the timeline of Will Bradley's life is not clearly established.
4. [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the boyhood chapter is abrupt.
5. [LOGIC] Some events are described in a way that doesn't clearly show cause and effect. For example, how Will Bradley's early experiences led to his career as an artist.
6. [CLARITY] Some descriptions are unclear. For example, "You have a little express wagon. You carried finished work back to the factories and returned with a supply of unfinished. For each trip you are paid five cents."
7. [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes jumps between different time periods without clear indication.
8. [CLARITY] The second-person narrative is inconsistent with the overall tone of the introduction chapter.
9. [LOGIC] The story sometimes provides too much detail on minor events and not enough on the main narrative.
10. [CLARITY] Some descriptions are overly verbose without adding clarity to the narrative.

Based on my analysis, I'll now rate the story on the two metrics.

For Fluency: The text has numerous grammatical errors, tense inconsistencies, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. This would likely result in a score of 2 out of 5.

For Coherence: While the story has a clear narrative about Will Bradley's early life, the structure is somewhat disjointed with an abrupt transition between chapters, and the connection between the introduction and the boyhood chapter is unclear. The second-person narrative also creates some inconsistency in tone. This would likely result in a score of 3 out of 5.
