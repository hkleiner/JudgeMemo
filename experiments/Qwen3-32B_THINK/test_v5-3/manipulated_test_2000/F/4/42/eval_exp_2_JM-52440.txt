Okay, let's start by understanding the user's task. They want me to act as a human annotator and rate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The story is a religious text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper.

First, I need to evaluate Coherence. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, the logical sequence of ideas, transitions between sections, and overall structure. I'll check if the arguments are presented in a clear order, if there are any abrupt jumps, or if the narrative is consistent. The text seems to be a structured argument with an introduction, chapters, and logical progression through different points (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). However, there might be some issues with transitions between paragraphs or sections. Also, I should look for repetition or ambiguities. For example, the author mentions the same points multiple times, which could affect coherence. Additionally, the use of complex theological terms might make the flow less smooth for some readers, but that's more about fluency.

Next, Fluency. This is about the readability of individual sentences, grammar, syntax, spelling, punctuation, and word choice. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or inconsistent verb tenses. The text is written in an old-fashioned style, which might contribute to some awkwardness. For instance, phrases like "was the real point at issue" should be "is the real point at issue" if the context is present. There are also instances where verb tenses don't match the context, like "there was no authoritative documents" should be "there are no authoritative documents." Additionally, some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow. Punctuation might be an issue where semicolons and commas are used incorrectly or where sentences are run-on.

Now, I'll go through the text to identify specific issues. 

Under Coherence:
- [STRUCTURE]: The structure is logical with chapters and sections, but the transition from the introduction to the first chapter is abrupt. The introduction sets up the purpose, but the first chapter jumps into discussing the Real Presence without a smooth transition.
- [LOGIC]: The argument about the Church of England's doctrine is presented in a logical sequence, but some points are repeated, such as the distinction between the sign and the thing signified in sacraments. This repetition could confuse the reader.
- [CLARITY]: The text uses complex theological language which might not be clear to all readers. For example, "the real objective presence" is explained, but the explanation is dense and could be more accessible.
- [TRANSITION]: Transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt. For example, after discussing the Articles, the text moves to the Catechism without a clear signpost, making the flow less smooth.

Under Fluency:
- [GRAMMAR]: There are several grammatical errors. For example, "teach by the Church of England" should be "taught by." "Am the true expositors" should be "are." "Give" should be "given." "Consisted" should be "consists." "Was the real point at issue" should be "is the real point at issue."
- [SPELLING]: Some words are misspelled or incorrectly used. For example, "bless Saviour" should be "blessed Saviour." "Consecrated elements" is correctly spelled, but "consecrated elements" is used consistently.
- [SYNTAX]: The syntax in some sentences is awkward. For example, "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England" could be rephrased for clarity. The sentence structure in the section on the Articles is complex, with long sentences that are hard to follow.
- [LEXICON]: The use of archaic language and theological terms might make the text less fluent for modern readers. Phrases like "beared more or less upon the subject" should be "bear more or less upon the subject." "Was not refer" should be "did not refer."
- [PUNCTUATION]: Some sentences have missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what was the real point at issue" should be "In doing this, our first business is..." Also, the use of semicolons in some places is incorrect or could be replaced with commas for better readability.

After identifying these issues, I need to assign scores. For Coherence, the structure is mostly logical, but the transitions and some repetitions affect it. I'll give a 3. For Fluency, there are multiple grammatical and syntactical errors that make the text less fluent. The archaic language also contributes to lower fluency. So, a 2 seems appropriate.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "teach by the Church of England" → "taught by"  
- [GRAMMAR] "am the true expositors" → "are"  
- [GRAMMAR] "give" → "given"  
- [GRAMMAR] "consisted" → "consists"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was the real point at issue" → "is the real point at issue"  
- [GRAMMAR] "bless Saviour" → "blessed Saviour"  
- [GRAMMAR] "beared more or less upon the subject" → "bear more or less upon the subject"  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." → "In doing this, our first business is..."  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Nor can there was any doubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17...")  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of arguments about the distinction between sign and thing signified  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., from introduction to "THE REAL PRESENCE" chapter)  
- [CLARITY] Dense theological terminology without sufficient explanation (e.g., "real objective presence")  
- [SPELLING] "consecrated elements" (repeated use of "consecrated" in awkward contexts)  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
