Alright, I need to analyze the given story and rate its coherence and fluency using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding the evaluation criteria.

**Coherence** is about the overall flow and logical structure of the story. It should have a clear progression, be non-repetitive, and avoid ambiguities. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced and if the narrative is consistent.

**Fluency** focuses on the readability of individual sentences. This includes grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I should look for any awkward phrasing or errors that might disrupt the smooth reading experience.

Let me read through the story carefully and note any issues.

The story is a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine of the Lord's Supper. It starts with an introduction, then moves to a chapter on the Real Presence, and discusses the Articles of Religion. The language is formal and academic.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text is quite dense and jumps between abstract theological concepts without clear transitions. The structure could be more clearly segmented to help the reader follow the argument.
2. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are overly complex and may be confusing to a general reader. For example, "That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual." This sentence is a jumble of words and lacks clarity.
3. **[LOGIC]** The logical flow between paragraphs is sometimes unclear. For instance, the discussion of the Articles of Religion seems to jump from one article to another without clear connections to the main argument.
4. **[TRANSITION]** There are few transitional phrases to guide the reader between ideas. For example, the transition from the introduction to the discussion of the Real Presence could be smoother.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences have awkward syntax that makes them hard to follow. For example, "In other words, before men they are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or witnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul." The structure is confusing and could be clearer.
2. **[SPELLING]** I don't see any obvious spelling errors, but the text is dense with theological terminology that may be challenging for some readers.
3. **[LEXICON]** The vocabulary is highly specialized and formal, which is appropriate for the content but may be difficult for a general audience.
4. **[PUNCTUATION]** Some sentences are long and could benefit from better punctuation to improve readability. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." The use of em dashes and the structure of the sentence could be clearer.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** There are a few grammatical issues, such as the jumbled sentence mentioned earlier and some awkward verb tenses or subject-verb agreement issues.

Based on these observations, I would rate the Coherence and Fluency scores as follows:

- **Coherence Score:** 3/5. The text has a clear purpose and is logically structured in its main argument, but the dense content, lack of clear transitions, and complex sentence structures make it challenging to follow at times.
- **Fluency Score:** 3/5. The text is generally well-written with few spelling errors, but the complex syntax, jargon, and some grammatical issues affect readability.

Now, let me write my final answer following the required format.
</think>

Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear segmentation between complex theological concepts, leading to a disjointed flow.  
- [CLARITY] Overly convoluted sentences (e.g., jumbled phrase about "faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding...") hinder comprehension.  
- [LOGIC] Jump between topics (e.g., abrupt shift from the Real Presence to the Articles of Religion) disrupts logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitional phrases between paragraphs and sections, making the argument feel fragmented.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "In other words, before men they are badges of our profession...") impede readability.  
- [LEXICON] Excessive use of specialized theological terminology may alienate general readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Long sentences with poor punctuation (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less...") create confusion.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
