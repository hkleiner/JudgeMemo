Let me analyze this story according to the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency.

First, I'll identify issues with coherence (how the story unfolds as a whole):

[LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different points in time and different locations without clear transitions. The author seems to be presenting a theory about where the Garden of Eden is located, but the logic of how this conclusion is reached is not clearly presented or supported.

[STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure. It begins with a claim about discovering the Garden of Eden, then jumps into a discussion about where it might be located, then presents what appears to be a description of the location, and then continues with more details about the geography and features of the area.

[CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing. The author presents a theory but doesn't clearly explain the evidence or reasoning that supports it. There are many assertions made without explanation or support.

[TRANSITION] There are very few effective transitions between ideas. The text often jumps from one idea to another without connecting them logically.

Now, I'll identify issues with fluency (how the text reads from start to finish):

[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and incorrect sentence structures.

[SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward and confusing. Some sentences are overly long and complex, while others are incomplete or fragmented.

[SPELLING] There are several spelling errors in the text, including "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (should be "admiriNg" or "admiring"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), and others.

[LEXICON] The word choice is often imprecise or inappropriate. The author sometimes uses words in ways that don't match their standard meanings.

[PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation throughout the text, including missing commas, missing periods, and incorrect use of punctuation.

Based on these observations, I would rate the story as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2 (The text presents a theory but lacks a clear structure, logical progression, and clear explanations. The narrative jumps around and doesn't present a coherent argument.)

FINAL Fluency Score: 2 (The text has numerous grammatical, syntactic, and spelling errors that make it difficult to read and understand. The writing is often awkward and confusing.)

Issues: [LOGIC] The narrative lacks logical progression and jumps between ideas without clear connections. The argument for Eden's location is presented without proper development or supporting evidence. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to follow the author's line of reasoning. [CLARITY] Many statements are unclear or ambiguous, with assertions made without explanation. [TRANSITION] There are minimal transitions between ideas, making the text feel disjointed. [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect verb tenses. [SYNTAX] Awkward and confusing sentence structures throughout. [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors including "antldiluvians," "admirirg," and "dimentions." [LEXICON] Inappropriate or imprecise word choices in several places. [PUNCTUATION] Issues with punctuation including missing commas and periods.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
