Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story for coherence and fluency on a 1-5 scale, and list the issues in bullet points with appropriate labels.

First, I'll read through the story carefully to get a sense of its content and structure. The story is about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist, and his early life and career. It's written in a narrative style, blending biography with some historical context.

Now, let's break down the evaluation criteria:

**Coherence:** This assesses how well the story unfolds as a whole. It should have logically sequenced ideas, be non-repetitive, smoothly connected, with a clear progression, avoid ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and be consistent and clear.

**Fluency:** This assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. The language should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.

Let me go through the story and identify issues in each category:

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [STRUCTURE]: The story jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions. It moves from Bradley's introduction to his early life in Ishpeming without a smooth transition.
2. [LOGIC]: The narrative sometimes lacks logical connections between events. For example, the transition from the introduction about Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to his childhood in Ishpeming is abrupt.
3. [CLARITY]: Some parts are unclear or ambiguous. For instance, the description of the "faker" at the end is confusing and doesn't clearly connect to the overall narrative about Bradley.
4. [STRUCTURE]: The story has a disjointed structure with the introduction followed by a detailed account of Bradley's early life, but no clear connection back to the introduction's themes.
5. [LOGIC]: There are some inconsistencies in the timeline and narrative flow. The story moves from Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to his childhood, then to his career, but these sections aren't clearly connected.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [SPELLING]: There are multiple spelling errors throughout the text. Examples include "seem" instead of "seen," "tom" instead of "room," "wzit" instead of "wait," "toqn" instead of "town," etc.
2. [GRAMMAR]: There are grammatical errors such as missing articles ("You are the artist"), incorrect verb forms ("werebknown" instead of "were known"), and incorrect prepositions ("on your way to Boston" should be "on your way to Boston").
3. [SYNTAX]: Some sentences have awkward or incorrect syntax. For example, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye" is awkwardly phrased.
4. [PUNCTUATION]: There are punctuation errors, such as missing commas and incorrect use of dashes. For example, "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy toom Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air."
5. [LEXICON]: Some word choices are incorrect or inappropriate. For example, "The editorâ€™s sanctum is at the front" - "sanctum" is an unusual and somewhat confusing word choice in this context.
6. [SPELLING]: There are numerous spelling errors such as "cmsitting" instead of "sitting," "wre" instead of "were," "rethrn" instead of "return," "cemts" instead of "cents," etc.
7. [GRAMMAR]: There are grammatical issues like subject-verb agreement errors and incorrect use of tenses. For example, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye" should be "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and crack an eye."
8. [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are run-on or have awkward phrasing that makes them difficult to follow. For example, "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors."

Now, let's score the story for coherence and fluency:

**Coherence Score:** 2/5
- The story lacks clear structure and logical progression. The transition between the introduction and the detailed account of Bradley's early life is abrupt.
- The narrative jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions.
- Some parts of the story are unclear or ambiguous, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative.

**Fluency Score:** 2/5
- The story contains numerous spelling errors that distract from the reading experience.
- There are grammatical errors that affect comprehension.
- The syntax is often awkward, and the punctuation is inconsistent.
- The word choice in some places is inappropriate or unclear.
- The many errors make the text difficult to read smoothly.

I need to present this in the requested format with bullet points for issues and final scores.

Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors: "seem" instead of "seen", "tom" instead of "room", "wzit" instead of "wait", "toqn" instead of "town", "cmsitting" instead of "sitting", "wre" instead of "were", "rethrn" instead of "return", "cemts" instead of "cents", etc.  
- [GRAMMAR] Grammatical errors: "werebknown" instead of "were known", missing articles ("You are the artist"), incorrect verb forms, subject-verb agreement issues.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye", "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern..."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or missing punctuation: "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy toom Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air."  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., from the introduction about Bradley's impact to his childhood in Ishpeming).  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative flow with unclear connections between events and time periods.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or confusing descriptions, such as the "faker" scene at the end that lacks clear context.  
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate word choices: "sanctum" in the context of an editor's office is unusual and unclear.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
