I'll analyze the story based on the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency, identifying specific issues in each category.

First, let me look at the text and identify problems:

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The text has a complex structure with dense theological arguments that may be difficult for some readers to follow. The logical flow of ideas is sometimes obscured by the academic tone and specialized vocabulary.
2. [STRUCTURE] While the text is organized into chapters and sections, the overall structure could be more clearly defined to help readers follow the argument progression.
3. [CLARITY] The content is highly specialized and theological in nature, which may make it less accessible to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
4. [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument.
5. [PERSPECTIVE] The text presents a clear position (criticizing the "Real Presence" doctrine) but could provide more balanced consideration of opposing views for better coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors throughout the text: "unvommon", "confidenve", "doctrime", "groundworknof", "blessed", "prssent", "vize", "witnesses", "badye", "dign", etc.
2. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and could benefit from restructuring for clarity.
3. [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors: "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England" (should be "but the teaching of the Church of England"), "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" (awkward phrasing), etc.
4. [PUNCTUATION] The text has some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of dashes and periods.
5. [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the subject matter, but some word choices could be clearer or more precise.
6. [PHRASING] Some phrases are awkward or could be more concise, particularly in the theological explanations.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the text on the two metrics:

For Coherence (how well the story unfolds as a whole with logical sequence, clear progression, and consistent structure):
- The text has a clear overall structure with an introduction and chapters, and the argument is generally coherent.
- However, the complex subject matter and dense writing style make it challenging for some readers to follow the logical flow.
- The text presents a clear thesis and follows it through, but the specialized content may limit its accessibility.
- I would rate it a 3 out of 5 for coherence, as it is generally coherent but could be more clearly structured and accessible to a broader audience.

For Fluency (how smoothly the text reads with attention to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation):
- The text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt the reading experience.
- Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or overly complex.
- The punctuation is generally correct but could be improved in some places.
- I would rate it a 2 out of 5 for fluency, as the errors and awkward phrasing significantly impact readability.

Let me revise my analysis to ensure it's accurate:

The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It presents a clear argument and has a logical structure with chapters and sections. However, the complex subject matter and dense writing style make it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. The text presents a clear thesis and follows it through, but the specialized content may limit its accessibility.

In terms of fluency, the text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt the reading experience. The sentence structure is often complex, with long, dense paragraphs that could benefit from more concise phrasing. The punctuation is generally correct but could be improved in some places.

My final assessment is:
- Coherence: 3/5 - The text has a clear overall structure and presents a coherent argument, but the complex subject matter and dense writing style make it challenging to follow for some readers.
- Fluency: 2/5 - The text has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that significantly impact readability, with some awkward phrasing and complex sentence structures.
