Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The user wants me to first list the issues in bullet points with appropriate labels and then assign scores.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The story is an analysis of Dickens's "Edwin Drood," discussing the plot, characters, and some theories about the novel's unresolved ending. The text seems to be a critical essay rather than a narrative story, which might affect how I assess coherence and fluency.

Starting with Coherence. Coherence refers to how well the story is structured and how logically the ideas flow. The text is an analytical essay, so the structure should be clear with an introduction, analysis of characters, and discussion of theories. However, I notice that the story is divided into chapters like "INTRODUCTION" and "THE STORY," which is good. But when I look at the content, there are some issues. The transition between the introduction and the analysis of the plot might be abrupt. Also, the mention of characters and their relationships is detailed but could be confusing if not clearly organized. For example, the relationships between Jasper, Rosa, Edwin, and other characters are complex, and if the text doesn't clarify them, it could affect coherence. Additionally, there are references to other critics and theories (like Mr. Proctor and Mr. Walters) which might not be fully explained, leading to ambiguity. The narrative jumps from discussing Dickens's writing style to the specific plot of "Edwin Drood" without a smooth transition. The part where the story suddenly shifts to a quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts seems out of place and disrupts the flow. These elements could lower the coherence score.

Now for Fluency. Fluency is about the grammatical correctness, sentence structure, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, there are some instances where sentences are long and complex, which might be hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." The structure here is a bit convoluted. There are also some archaic or formal phrases that might be less common, but they don't necessarily make the text incoherent. However, there are some possible grammatical errors. For instance, in the line "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is 'Watched by the Dead,' by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)." The phrase "the most careful of the attempts" is correct, but the sentence structure could be clearer. Also, the use of italics and quotation marks might be inconsistent. There's a part where the text says "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy." This quote seems out of context and might be a misplaced or incorrect insertion, affecting fluency. Additionally, some sentences have awkward phrasing, like "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The use of "or even" and the structure here could be smoother. There are also some missing commas or punctuation that might make the reading less smooth.

Looking for spelling errors, I don't see any obvious ones, but there might be some less common words that are spelled correctly but used in a way that's confusing. For example, "Sapsea" and "Durdles" are names from the story, so they are correct in context. The use of French terms like "_roman policier_" is italicized, which is correct. However, the transition to discussing Lord Canterville and ghosts seems like an error, possibly a misplaced paragraph from another text, which would definitely affect fluency and coherence.

In terms of structure, the essay starts with an introduction about Dickens's writing style, moves to the plot of "Edwin Drood," discusses characters, and then theories. However, the mention of Lord Canterville and the ghost seems to be a non-sequitur, which is a major issue for coherence. This part is likely an error or a copy-paste mistake, disrupting the flow.

So, for Coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions, the misplaced quote about Lord Canterville, and the lack of clear explanation for some references. For Fluency, the issues include complex and awkward sentence structures, possible grammatical errors, and the disruptive quote. 

Assigning scores, I would say Coherence is around 3 because the structure is somewhat clear but has significant issues with transitions and the misplaced paragraph. Fluency is also around 3 due to the complex sentences and the disruptive quote affecting readability.

Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] The story abruptly shifts from analyzing Dickens's work to a disjointed quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts, which seems misplaced and unrelated to the main narrative.  
[LOGIC] The relationships between characters (e.g., Jasper, Rosa, Edwin) are described in a dense, complex manner, making it difficult to follow their motivations and connections.  
[TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the analysis of *Edwin Drood* is abrupt, lacking smooth narrative flow.  
[CLARITY] References to critics (e.g., Mr. Proctor, Mr. Walters) and their theories are underexplained, causing ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the context.  
[LEXICON] The use of archaic or overly formal language (e.g., "hab nab at a venture," "unlovely gesture") may hinder modern readability.  
[SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the opening paragraph of "OPENING OF THE TALE") reduce fluency and clarity.  
[GRAMMAR] The misplaced quote about Lord Canterville contains inconsistent tone and grammatical structure compared to the rest of the text.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
