Okay, let me start by reading through the user's instructions carefully. They want me to evaluate a story based on coherence and fluency, pointing out issues in bullet points with specific labels and then giving scores.

First, I'll read the story provided. It's a biography of Will Bradley, split into two chapters. The first is an introduction, and the second is about his early life as a printer in Ishpeming. 

Now, for coherence. The story's structure is a bit confusing. The first chapter is an introduction written by someone else, which is a common structure, but the transition to the second chapter about Bradley's childhood is abrupt. There's a lack of clear connection between the two chapters. The timeline jumps from the introduction's present (retirement) to his childhood in Ishpeming without smooth transitions. Also, the narrative in the second chapter is very episodic and lacks a clear progression. The events are presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, making it hard to follow Bradley's development.

Looking for specific issues under coherence:
- [LOGIC]: The story jumps from the introduction to the childhood without explaining the connection.
- [STRUCTURE]: The two chapters are not well-integrated; the shift is abrupt.
- [CLARITY]: Some parts are unclear, like the purpose of the introduction chapter in relation to the biography.
- [TRANSITION]: Lack of smooth transitions between chapters and within the childhood narrative.

For fluency, I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The story has some instances of awkward phrasing and missing words. For example, in the introduction, phrases like "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams" might be better phrased as "bursting at the seams." There are also some missing articles and prepositions, like "a thing" instead of specific locations. 

Specific fluency issues:
- [SYNTAX]: Awkward sentence structures, such as "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window."
- [SPELLING]: No obvious spelling errors, but some terms might be archaic or misused.
- [LEXICON]: Use of words like "a thing" where a specific place name is expected.
- [GRAMMAR]: Missing articles and prepositions, e.g., "the owner and editor is John D. West" should be "are" for agreement.

Now, assigning scores. Coherence is 3 because the story is somewhat structured but lacks smooth transitions and clear connections. Fluency is 3 as well due to some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing that affect readability.

Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from the introduction to Bradley's childhood chapter without clear narrative connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed timeline: jumps from retirement (present) to childhood (1875) without temporal markers.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to "a thing," "the thing," and unspecified locations (e.g., "Massachusetts, just outside Boston").  
- [TRANSITION] No logical progression between the two chapters; the introduction feels disconnected from the biographical narrative.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case..." (run-on sentence).  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "a thing" instead of specific names, disrupting immersion.  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error: "the owner and editor is John D. West" (should be "are").  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
