Alright, I need to analyze this story according to the given evaluation criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each scored on a 1-5 scale.

**Coherence:**
- The story is about the author's claim to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley. The narrative is presented in a somewhat disjointed way, with long, meandering sentences that don't always clearly connect one idea to the next.
- There are multiple references to "the thing" and "a stuff" which are unclear and create confusion.
- The author jumps between describing the location, the geography, and the religious implications without clear transitions.
- The narrative lacks a clear structure or progression, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.
- The author makes claims about the Garden of Eden's location but doesn't provide a clear, logical explanation of how this location matches the biblical description.
- The text contains many references to specific places and features without proper context or explanation.

**Fluency:**
- There are numerous spelling errors: "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "antideluvians" (antediluvians), "consitutes" (constitutes), "hightest" (highest), "jageed" (jagged), "Trempealeau" (misspelled in several places).
- There are grammatical errors: "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" - this is confusing and poorly constructed.
- The text has awkward phrasing and word choice: "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'"
- The punctuation is often incorrect or inconsistent.
- The text has many run-on sentences and lacks proper paragraphing.

Let me organize these issues more formally:

**Issues:**
- [COHERENCE] The narrative is disjointed with unclear connections between ideas.
- [COHERENCE] The text contains numerous references to "the thing" and "a stuff" that are never explained, creating confusion.
- [COHERENCE] The author jumps between topics without clear transitions.
- [COHERENCE] The structure of the narrative is unclear and lacks logical progression.

- [FLUENCY] There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.
- [FLUENCY] The punctuation is often incorrect or inconsistent.
- [FLUENCY] The text contains run-on sentences and lacks proper paragraphing.

Now, I'll assign scores:
