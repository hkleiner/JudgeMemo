I need to evaluate the given story on two metrics: coherence and fluency, using a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Let me first understand the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency** focuses on how the text reads from start to finish, with attention to:
- Syntax
- Grammar
- Spelling
- Word choice
- Phrasing
- Punctuation

**Coherence** focuses on how the story unfolds as a whole, with attention to:
- Logical sequence
- Non-repetitive ideas
- Smooth connections between sections
- Clear progression
- Avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps
- Consistent and clear narrative structure

Now I'll analyze the story and identify issues for each metric:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] The story has some missing words and incomplete sentences, such as "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget. Then he sends you out to play."
2. [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have inconsistent punctuation, like "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably."
3. [PUNCTUATION] There are instances of inconsistent punctuation use, such as the repeated use of em-dashes without consistency.
4. [PUNCTUATION] The text has some missing punctuation, like the sentence that ends with "He is an inveterate sportsman" which appears to be cut off.
5. [PUNCTUATION] There are some inconsistent capitalization patterns, such as "The home assistant played ambient music." and "A livestream began recording." which seem out of place in a historical narrative.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The story jumps between different narrative perspectives - sometimes it's a first-person narrator, sometimes it's a biographical narrative in third person, and sometimes it's as if the narrator is experiencing the events.
2. [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure, with no clear beginning, middle, and end. It appears to be a collection of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative.
3. [TRANSITION] The transitions between different time periods and locations are abrupt and lack clear indicators of time or place changes.
4. [LOGIC] The narrative includes anachronisms, such as "The home assistant played ambient music" and "A livestream began recording" in a story set in the 19th century.
5. [CLARITY] The purpose of the narrative is unclear - is it a biography of Will Bradley, a fictionalized account of his life, or something else?
6. [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice is inconsistent - at times it reads like a biography, at other times like a first-person memoir, and at other times like a historical document.
7. [STRUCTURE] The story appears to be a collection of disconnected vignettes rather than a unified narrative with a clear progression.

Now I'll assign scores based on these observations:

For **Fluency**, I would give a score of 3. The text is generally readable and has good vocabulary, but there are noticeable grammatical issues, punctuation inconsistencies, and some awkward phrasing that affect the smoothness of the reading experience.

For **Coherence**, I would give a score of 2. The narrative lacks a clear structure and logical progression. It jumps between different narrative perspectives and time periods without clear transitions. The inclusion of anachronistic elements further disrupts the coherence of the narrative.

Let me double-check my analysis and scoring to make sure I've captured the key issues accurately.

Issues: 
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation throughout the text, with some sentences missing punctuation entirely and others using em-dashes inconsistently.
- [GRAMMAR] Some grammatical errors and incomplete sentences, such as the abrupt ending "He is an inveterate sportsman" which appears cut off.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different perspectives - at times it reads as first-person, at other times as a biography, and at other times as a historical document.
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure and appears to be a collection of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between different time periods and locations without clear indicators of time or place changes.
- [ANACHRONISM] The text includes anachronistic elements like "The home assistant played ambient music" and "A livestream began recording" in a story set in the 19th century.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the narrative is unclear - it's not clear whether it's a biography, a fictionalized account, or something else.
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice is inconsistent, shifting between different styles and perspectives without clear transitions.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
