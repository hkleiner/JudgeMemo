I need to evaluate the given story according to the criteria of Coherence and Fluency on a scale of 1-5. Let me analyze the text carefully.

First, let me understand what the story is about:
The story is written from the perspective of someone who has discovered what they believe to be the Garden of Eden, specifically in the area of Trempealeau on the Mississippi River. The author makes various claims about how this location matches the biblical description of the Garden of Eden, including the presence of four rivers, the geographical features, and the presence of rattlesnakes as a symbolic serpent.

Now, let me evaluate this text according to the two criteria:

**Fluency Evaluation:**
Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences.

Issues I notice with fluency:
[GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and improper use of prepositions.
[SYNTAX] - The sentence structure is often awkward and difficult to follow.
[SPELLING] - There are several spelling errors, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "antideluvians" instead of "antediluvians", and "jageed" instead of "jagged".
[WORD CHOICE] - Some word choices are awkward or inappropriate for the context.
[PUNCTUATION] - There are issues with punctuation, including missing commas and periods, and improper use of dashes.
[STYLE] - The text has an overly verbose and repetitive style that makes it difficult to read.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logically sequenced ideas, smooth transitions, and clear narrative structure.

Issues I notice with coherence:
[LOGIC] - The argument presented is not logically consistent. The author makes claims that are not well-supported by evidence.
[STRUCTURE] - The narrative lacks a clear structure and often jumps between ideas without proper transitions.
[CLARITY] - The text is often unclear and difficult to follow.
[CONSISTENCY] - There are inconsistencies in the author's claims and arguments.
[FOCUS] - The text lacks a clear focus and wanders from one topic to another.
[TRANSITION] - There are abrupt transitions between ideas without proper connections.

Let me now summarize the issues and assign scores:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors that significantly affect readability. The sentence structure is often awkward, and the word choice is sometimes inappropriate. The text is not fluent and would be difficult for a reader to follow.

Based on the scale:
1 - Text is very difficult to read with many errors
2 - Text has significant errors that affect comprehension
3 - Text has some errors but is mostly readable
4 - Text has minor errors but is generally readable
5 - Text is fluent and free of errors

I would rate the fluency as a 2.

**Coherence Score:**
The narrative lacks logical flow and structure. The author's arguments are not well-organized and often jump from one idea to another without clear transitions. The text lacks a coherent narrative structure and would be difficult for a reader to follow the author's reasoning.

Based on the scale:
1 - Text has no coherent structure and is very difficult to follow
2 - Text has significant issues with structure and logical flow
3 - Text has some issues with structure but is mostly coherent
4 - Text has minor issues with structure but is generally coherent
5 - Text has a clear and logical structure

I would rate the coherence as a 2.

Now I'll summarize my findings in the requested format:
</think>
