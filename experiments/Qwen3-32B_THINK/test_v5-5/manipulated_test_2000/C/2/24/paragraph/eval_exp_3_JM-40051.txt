Alright, I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided criteria. Let me start by reading through the story carefully to understand its content and structure.

The story is about the discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, particularly near the Mississippi River. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions to support their claim. The text is quite long and detailed, with various sections and paragraphs that elaborate on the location's features and its supposed connection to the Garden of Eden.

Now, I'll evaluate the Coherence first. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logical sequencing, clear progression, and consistency. Let me look for any issues:

1. [LOGIC] The story jumps between different ideas and topics without clear transitions. It starts with the author's discovery, then discusses biblical references, geographical details, and then abruptly shifts to a section about a mobile hotspot and voice-activated controls, which seems out of place.
   
2. [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat disjointed. The story begins with the author's personal account of discovery, then moves into a detailed geographical description, but then there are strange interjections like "A mobile hotspot activated." and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." These seem like they might be errors or misplaced text.
   
3. [CLARITY] Some parts are unclear or confusing. For example, the author mentions "antldiluvians" (probably a misspelling of "antediluvians") and makes comparisons between the Mississippi and the Euphrates that are not clearly explained. The connection between the biblical Garden of Eden and the specific location in the United States is made, but the reasoning is not always clear.
   
4. [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak or absent. The story often moves from one idea to another without connecting sentences or phrases, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
   
5. [INCONSISTENCIES] There are inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, the author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden, but then there are sections that seem to be about a different topic entirely, like a mobile hotspot and voice-activated controls, which don't relate to the main narrative.

Now, I'll evaluate the Fluency. Fluency is about the correctness and smoothness of the language at the sentence level, including grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice.

1. [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors. For example, "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" is awkwardly phrased. "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" is not grammatically correct.
   
2. [SPELLING] There are spelling errors throughout the text. For example, "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "dimentions" (should be "dimensions"), "euphony" (should be "euphony" is correct, but "euphony" is misspelled as "euphony" in the text), "Havilah" (correctly spelled but contextually unclear), "jageed" (should be "jagged"), "ampitheater" (should be "amphitheater").
   
3. [SYNTAX] The syntax is often awkward or incorrect. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" – the capitalization of "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" seems incorrect and disrupts the flow.
   
4. [LEXICON] There are instances of inappropriate word choice. For example, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" – "finger of time" is not a standard expression and may be confusing. "The Euphrates river crosses that country" – the article "the" before "Euphrates river" is correct, but the overall sentence structure is awkward.
   
5. [PUNCTUATION] Punctuation is often incorrect or missing. For example, "And from thence,——it was" has an unusual use of em-dashes. "The second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark" – "hightest" should be "highest."

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores for Coherence and Fluency:

For Coherence, the story has significant issues with logical flow, structure, and transitions. The narrative is often disjointed and the connections between ideas are weak or absent. There are also inconsistencies in the content. This would place it around a 2 or 3 on the scale.

For Fluency, the text has numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward syntax, and punctuation issues that affect readability. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is significantly impacted by these errors. This would place it around a 2 or 3 on the scale.

After considering the specific criteria and the issues identified, I would rate the Coherence as a 2 and the Fluency as a 2 as well. The story is not coherent in its overall structure and the language is not fluent due to numerous errors.

Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative contains abrupt shifts and logical inconsistencies, such as the sudden introduction of unrelated elements like "A mobile hotspot activated." and "The voice-activated controls blinked to life," which disrupt the flow of the main argument. 
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear organizational structure, with paragraphs jumping between geographical descriptions, biblical references, and disjointed asides, making it difficult to follow the central claim. 
- [CLARITY] Key terms like "antldiluvians" (likely a misspelling of "antediluvians") and "Havilah" are used without clear explanation, and the connection between the Mississippi River and the Garden of Eden is not logically or persuasively established. 
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between ideas or sections; the text often shifts abruptly from one topic to another without connecting phrases. 
- [INCONSISTENCIES] The narrative includes contradictory or unclear statements, such as claiming the Garden of Eden is in a specific location while later describing unrelated technological elements. 
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors, such as "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" and "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles," disrupt readability. 
- [SPELLING] Frequent spelling mistakes include "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "jageed," and "ampitheater," which hinder comprehension. 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures, such as "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it," and incorrect capitalization (e.g., "CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT") reduce fluency. 
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of punctuation, including excessive em-dashes ("——it was") and missing commas, further affects readability. 

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
