Alright, I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency, using the provided Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let me start by understanding the definitions and scoring guidelines for each metric.

### Coherence
- **Definition:** Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
- **Score 5:** Entirely coherent, well-structured and well-organized, building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information among all the sentences.
- **Score 4:** Only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence.
- **Score 3:** Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.
- **Score 2:** There are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.
- **Score 1:** Not coherent at all, many logical gaps, no progression, and many sections that feel disjointed or out of sync with the rest.

### Fluency
- **Definition:** Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
- **Score 5:** Entirely fluent, grammatically correct, and well written.
- **Score 4:** Only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect.
- **Score 3:** Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text.
- **Score 2:** There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.
- **Score 1:** Not fluent at all, full of meaningless fragments and unclear contents.

Now, I'll analyze the given story for issues in both coherence and fluency.

### Coherence Issues:
1. **Abrupt shifts in narrative:** The story transitions between different time periods and locations without clear transitions or contextual clues, making it difficult to follow the chronology and progression of the narrative.
2. **Unresolved references:** There are several references to people, places, and events that are not explained or contextualized for the reader (e.g., "Kelmscott House", "The Youth's Companion", "The Daily Item").
3. **Disjointed paragraphs:** Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous one, creating a sense of disorganization (e.g., the paragraph about "The Peninsula Record" seems disconnected from the previous narrative about the print shop).
4. **Missing context for historical figures and events:** The story references historical figures and events (e.g., Theodore Roosevelt, the Yellow Book, Toulouse-Lautrec) without providing sufficient context for a general reader.
5. **Inconsistent narrative voice:** The story switches between a biographical narrative and a more analytical or critical tone without clear demarcation, creating confusion about the author's perspective.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **Grammatical errors:** There are several grammatical errors in the text (e.g., "The two jobbers are kicked" - unclear what is being kicked, "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window" - awkward phrasing).
2. **Awkward phrasing:** Some sentences have awkward or unnatural phrasing (e.g., "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston" - unclear what "Narrow Gauge" refers to without context).
3. **Missing punctuation:** Some sentences lack appropriate punctuation, making them difficult to parse (e.g., "He is an inveterate sportsman").
4. **Inconsistent tense usage:** The narrative switches between past and present tense without clear reason or transition.
5. **Word choice issues:** Some word choices are either archaic or unclear without context (e.g., "devil" referring to an apprentice printer, "job printer" without explanation).

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence and fluency of the text as follows:

**Coherence Score:** 3 - The story is coherent in general, but there are several obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text. The narrative lacks clear transitions between different time periods and locations, and there are many references to people, places, and events that are not explained for the reader.

**Fluency Score:** 3 - The text is fluent in general, but there are some obvious grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that hinder the flow of the text. The language is not consistently smooth and there are several instances of unclear or awkward phrasing.

Now I'll format my answer according to the requested output format:

Issues: 
- [COHERENCE] Abrupt shifts in narrative between different time periods and locations without clear transitions.
- [COHERENCE] Unresolved references to people, places, and events that are not explained for the reader.
- [COHERENCE] Disjointed paragraphs that begin without clear connection to the previous one.
- [COHERENCE] Missing context for historical figures and events referenced in the text.
- [COHERENCE] Inconsistent narrative voice that switches between biographical narrative and critical tone.
- [FLUENCY] Grammatical errors such as "The two jobbers are kicked" and "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window."
- [FLUENCY] Awkward phrasing like "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston."
- [FLUENCY] Missing punctuation in sentences like "He is an inveterate sportsman."
- [FLUENCY] Inconsistent tense usage throughout the narrative.
- [FLUENCY] Word choice issues with archaic or unclear terms without explanation.
