Alright, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given story based on coherence and fluency using the provided Likert scale. The story is a theological text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England.

First, I'll check for fluency issues. Fluency is about grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I'll look for any errors or awkward phrasing. The text is quite formal and uses complex sentences. I notice some repetition, like "the stuff" and "the thing," which might be placeholders or errors. There are instances where the flow is disrupted by vague references, such as "the thing; and these three I propose to investigate in that order." Also, some sentences are run-on or have awkward structures, like "But, I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing, and the thing; and these three I propose to investigate in that order." The use of "stuff" instead of "Church" or "teaching" seems incorrect and could be a typo or placeholder.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and clarity of the narrative. The text is dense with theological arguments, which might be challenging for some readers. The structure is somewhat clear with chapters and sections, but the arguments sometimes jump between points without smooth transitions. For example, the discussion shifts from the general definition of sacraments to specific articles of the Church without clear links. There are also some unclear references, like "the thing" and "the stuff," which make the text confusing. The repetition of phrases like "the stuff" and the lack of clear explanations for key terms might hinder coherence. The overall argument is about the Church of England's doctrine, but the way it's presented has some logical jumps and lacks smooth transitions between sections.

Now, scoring. For fluency, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the text is mostly readable. The repetition and placeholder terms like "stuff" and "thing" are issues. I'd say it's a 3 because there are obvious errors that affect the flow. For coherence, the structure is somewhat logical but has abrupt shifts and unclear references. The arguments are dense but not entirely disjointed. I'd rate it a 3 as well because there are some unclarity and logical gaps, though the main points are somewhat connected.

Issues: [GRAMMAR] Repeated use of "the stuff" and "the thing" without clear definitions. [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "But, I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing, and the thing; and these three I propose to investigate in that order." [LEXICON] Ambiguous terms like "the stuff" and "the thing" create confusion. [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between theological arguments and structural markers (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject"). [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between sections discussing sacraments and the Church of England’s doctrine.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
