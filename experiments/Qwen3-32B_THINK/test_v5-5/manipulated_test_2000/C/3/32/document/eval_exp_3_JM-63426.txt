Let me analyze this story to evaluate its coherence and fluency according to the provided criteria.

First, I'll check for coherence issues:
- [LOGIC] The text contains many references to "a thing" and "a stuff" which are clearly placeholders for specific locations or objects that should have been named. These placeholders make the narrative confusing and disrupt the logical flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different narrative modes - at times it reads like a biography of Will Bradley, at other times it reads like a fictionalized account of his childhood. This inconsistency in narrative structure affects coherence.
- [LOGIC] The timeline and chronology of events are sometimes unclear. For example, the story jumps from Bradley's childhood to his career without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] There are numerous references to historical events and figures without sufficient context for readers who may not be familiar with them (e.g., Morris, Beardsley, Toulouse-Lautrec).
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the introduction to "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter without a clear transition.

Now for fluency issues:
- [LEXICON] The text contains many instances of "a thing" and "a stuff" which are clearly placeholders for specific terms that should have been used. These placeholders indicate missing vocabulary and affect the fluency of the text.
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling issues like "pi" which should likely be "ink" or something else.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward syntax that makes them hard to follow, such as "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window."
- [SPELLING] There are some missing or incorrect punctuation marks, such as the question mark in "heated (?) with one stove."
- [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic or unclear expressions that may be confusing to modern readers.

Based on these observations:

For Coherence Score:
The story has significant coherence issues due to the placeholder terms, inconsistent narrative mode, and abrupt transitions. While there is a general narrative arc, the logical flow and structure are disrupted by these issues. I would rate this as a 2 - there are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.

For Fluency Score:
The text has numerous fluency issues with placeholders, spelling errors, and awkward syntax. While the general meaning can be discerned, the reading experience is frequently disrupted by these issues. I would rate this as a 2 - there are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

So my final ratings are:
FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Numerous instances of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders instead of specific terms, disrupting logical flow and coherence
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent narrative mode shifting between biography and fictionalized account without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Unclear timeline and chronology with abrupt shifts between different periods of Bradley's life
- [CLARITY] Many historical references (Morris, Beardsley, etc.) lack sufficient context for general readers
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between the introduction chapter and the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter without explanation
- [LEXICON] Use of "pi" likely as placeholder for ink or another substance
- [SPELLING] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., question mark in "heated (?) with one stove")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in sentences like "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window"

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
