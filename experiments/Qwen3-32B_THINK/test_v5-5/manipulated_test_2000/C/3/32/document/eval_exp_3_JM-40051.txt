Let me analyze this story to identify issues with coherence and fluency.

First, I'll read through the entire text to get an overall understanding of what it's about. This appears to be a narrative about the supposed discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States (Mississippi River region). The author is making a claim that the Garden of Eden is located in this area based on biblical descriptions and geographical features.

Now, I'll identify specific issues with coherence and fluency:

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [STRUCTURE] The text has an inconsistent structure with no clear beginning, middle, and end. It jumps between different ideas without clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] The argumentation is weak and lacks logical progression. The author makes many claims without sufficient evidence or logical connections.
3. [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing. The author uses vague language and makes sweeping statements without explanation.
4. [TRANSITION] There are few transitions between paragraphs, making the flow of ideas difficult to follow.
5. [CONSISTENCY] The text is inconsistent in its claims and references to locations. The author mentions specific places but then contradicts or confuses them.
6. [FOCUS] The text lacks a clear focus and wanders from one idea to another without a coherent theme.
7. [ORGANIZATION] The information is not well-organized. The author introduces ideas, then returns to them later in a confusing manner.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect sentence structures.
2. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions."
3. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is often incorrect or missing, affecting the readability of the text.
4. [WORD CHOICE] The author uses inappropriate or awkward word choices in many places.
5. [SYNTAX] The sentence structures are often awkward and difficult to follow.
6. [REPETITION] There is unnecessary repetition of ideas and phrases.
7. [PHRASING] The phrasing is often awkward and unnatural, making the text difficult to read smoothly.

Now, I'll score the text based on the evaluation criteria:

**Coherence Score:** 
The text has significant issues with coherence. The structure is inconsistent, the argumentation is weak, and the flow of ideas is often confusing. While the author does attempt to present a narrative about the location of the Garden of Eden, the text lacks a clear progression and logical connections between ideas. There are some coherent segments, but the overall coherence is limited.
Given the description of the scoring scale, I would rate the coherence as a 2.

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous issues with fluency. There are many grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing throughout the text. The sentence structures are often confusing, and the punctuation is frequently incorrect or missing. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is significantly hindered by these issues.
Given the description of the scoring scale, I would rate the fluency as a 2.

Let me now prepare the final answer in the requested format.
