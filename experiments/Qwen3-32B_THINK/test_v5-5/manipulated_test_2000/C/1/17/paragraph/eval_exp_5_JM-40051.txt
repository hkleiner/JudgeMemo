Let me analyze this story and identify issues with coherence and fluency.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1. [LOGIC] The story abruptly shifts between different narratives and time periods without clear transitions. It starts as a discovery of Eden, then shifts to a love triangle, then to a house in Canterville Chase, then back to the Eden narrative, then to an office setting, and then to a character named George Stransom. These shifts are jarring and make the narrative incoherent.
2. [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure or organization. It begins with a claim about finding Eden but then introduces unrelated narratives that don't connect to the main topic.
3. [CLARITY] The text is confusing and unclear in its purpose. It appears to be a patchwork of different stories without a unifying theme or clear narrative direction.
4. [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the different narrative threads. The shifts are abrupt and disorienting for the reader.
5. [CONSISTENCY] The story is inconsistent in its focus. It begins as a historical/religious narrative about finding Eden but then introduces completely unrelated fictional stories.

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1. [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and subject-verb agreement issues.
2. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, including "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", and "consitutes" instead of "constitutes".
3. [SYNTAX] The sentence structures are often awkward and confusing, with some sentences being run-on and others being fragmented.
4. [PUNCTUATION] There are issues with punctuation, including missing commas, incorrect use of hyphens, and improper use of quotation marks.
5. [LEXICON] Some word choices are inappropriate or out of context for the narrative.
6. [PHRASING] The phrasing is often awkward or unnatural, making the text difficult to read smoothly.

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
- The text has many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be somewhat understandable with some effort. The narrative jumps between unrelated stories without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow.

FINAL Fluency Score: 2
- There are major grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and other issues that significantly affect the readability of the text. While there are some fluent segments, the overall fluency is severely hindered by these issues.
