Okay, I need to evaluate this story for coherence and fluency. Let's start with the fluency. The user mentioned looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. 

First, I'll skim through the text. The story is a mix of literary analysis and a narrative about Dickens's "Edwin Drood." There are some complex sentences. Let me check for any obvious errors.

Looking at the first paragraph: "FORSTER tells us..." The first letter is capitalized, which is odd for a sentence. Maybe a typo. Also, "FORSTER" is all caps, which might be a title or a name. Wait, it's a person's name, so maybe it should be "Forster" with a capital F. That's a typo. 

Next, "FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_ onwards (1853), “assiduously cultivated” construction, “this essential of his art.”" The quotation marks are used here. The user might be using italics and quotes for book titles, which is correct. 

Looking for spelling errors. "Demned outline" is misspelled as "demned" should be "darned." Wait, the text says "a demned outline," which is incorrect. The correct phrase is "a damned outline." So that's a spelling mistake. 

Another part: "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." The phrase "or _roman policier_" is in italics, which is correct for a French term. But "or even of Gaboriau" – Gaboriau is a correct name. 

In the next paragraph: "Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales rivals in merit his early picaresque stories..." The use of italics for the book title is correct. 

Then there's a part about "The tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap." The word "cord" here might be a metaphor, but it's a bit unclear. Maybe "the tension snapping" would make more sense. But it's a literary device, so maybe not a mistake. 

Looking at "On the Eve we went to bed..." The capitalization of "Eve" is odd unless it's part of a title. But it's not in italics, so maybe a typo. Should be lowercase "eve." 

In the section about Stransom and Mary Antrim: "Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision, a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew." The sentence is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. 

There's a part where "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." The phrase "as happened" is a bit awkward. Maybe "as it happened" would be better. 

In the "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" section: "For the discovery of Dickens’s secret in _Edwin Drood_ it is necessary to obtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their relations to each other." The sentence is long but structurally correct. 

Looking for coherence now. The story starts with an analysis of Dickens's writing style, then transitions into a narrative involving characters from "Edwin Drood." The flow between the analytical part and the narrative might be abrupt. The transition from discussing Dickens's techniques to the actual story of Edwin Drood could be jarring, which might affect coherence. 

The story includes a lot of character descriptions and plot setup, which is necessary for a mystery, but if the connections between the characters aren't clear, it might confuse the reader. For example, the relationships between Jasper, Rosa, Edwin, and others need to be clearly established. 

There's a section where the story shifts to a dialogue that seems out of place: "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy." This seems like a quote from another story, perhaps "The Canterville Ghost," but it's inserted in the middle of the Edwin Drood analysis. This is a coherence issue because it's a non-sequitur and disrupts the flow. 

The story then abruptly ends with the mention of Sapsea and Durdles, leaving the main narrative of Edwin Drood unresolved. The structure jumps between different sections without clear transitions, which affects coherence. 

For fluency, the main issues are the spelling mistake "demned" instead of "damned," the capitalization of "Eve," and the awkward phrase "as happened." There are also some complex sentences that might be difficult to follow but are grammatically correct. 

For coherence, the main problems are the abrupt transitions between the analytical sections and the narrative, the out-of-place quote from "The Canterville Ghost," and the unresolved ending that doesn't tie up the story properly. These issues make the text feel disjointed.

Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "demned outline" should be "damned outline"  
- [GRAMMAR] Capitalization of "FORSTER" and "Eve" where lowercase is appropriate  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from analytical discussion to narrative, disrupting flow  
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur quote about Lord Canterville and ghosts inserted mid-narrative  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between characters (e.g., Jasper’s motivations)  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift to "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" without narrative resolution  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
