Okay, I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided criteria. Let's start by understanding the story's structure and content.

The story is divided into two chapters: "An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The first chapter seems to be an introduction to Will Bradley, discussing his impact on American graphic arts, his work, and a narrative about Stransom encountering Paul Creston and his wife. The second chapter is a more personal account of Will Bradley's early life, his education, work in print shops, and his journey towards becoming an artist.

First, I'll check for Fluency issues. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll look for any errors in these areas.

Looking through the first chapter, the sentences are generally well-structured. There are some complex sentences, but they seem grammatically correct. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career..." This is a bit long but still coherent. I don't notice any obvious spelling mistakes. The punctuation seems appropriate, though some sentences might be a bit run-on. For example, the sentence starting with "He had this year..." is quite long but still flows well.

In the second chapter, the narrative shifts to Bradley's childhood. The sentences are straightforward and mostly simple, which makes them fluent. There's a mix of past and present tense, but it's used to create a narrative effect, so it doesn't seem like an error. I don't see any spelling mistakes here either. The dialogue is presented in quotes, which is correct.

Now, checking for Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the story. The first chapter introduces Bradley's work and then shifts to a story involving Stransom and Paul Creston. This shift might be abrupt and confusing. The Stransom-Creston story doesn't seem directly connected to Bradley's work, which could be a coherence issue. The transition from discussing Bradley's impact to a narrative about Stransom is abrupt and might leave the reader wondering how it relates to the main subject.

In the second chapter, the narrative is more linear, following Bradley's childhood and early career. The events are in chronological order, which is coherent. However, there are some shifts in time and place that could be confusing. For example, the story moves from Bradley's early life to his work in the print shop, which is logical, but some details (like the part about Sir Simon and the blood-stain) seem out of place and unrelated to the rest of the story. This could be a coherence issue as it introduces an element that doesn't fit with the main narrative.

Another point is the sudden appearance of the Stransom-Creston story in the first chapter without prior context. This might disrupt the flow and make the story feel disjointed. The reader might not understand the relevance of this subplot to Bradley's life or the main theme.

Looking at the evaluation criteria, for Coherence Score 3: Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity. The abrupt shift in the first chapter and the unrelated Sir Simon part in the second chapter would lower the score. For Fluency, there are no major grammatical errors, so it might be a 4 or 5. However, some sentences are complex and might be a bit hard to follow, which could bring it down to a 4.

So, final scores would be Coherence 3 and Fluency 4.

Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between discussing Will Bradley’s work and the unrelated Stransom-Creston narrative in the first chapter is abrupt and lacks contextual connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Sir Simon and the blood-stain in the second chapter is disjointed and irrelevant to Bradley’s story, creating a logical inconsistency.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the biographical chapter is jarring, with no clear narrative thread linking the two.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the Stransom-Creston anecdote is unclear, leaving the reader confused about its relevance to Bradley’s legacy.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
