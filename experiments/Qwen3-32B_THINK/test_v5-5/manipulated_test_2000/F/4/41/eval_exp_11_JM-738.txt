Alright, let's tackle this task. The user provided a story and wants me to evaluate it based on coherence and fluency using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. First, I need to understand the criteria for each.

For fluency, I'm looking at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Any errors here would affect the fluency score. The story seems to be a critical analysis of Dickens's work, so it's written in a formal academic style. I need to check for any grammatical mistakes, misspellings, or awkward phrasing.

Looking through the text, I notice some potential issues. For example, "assiduously cultivated" might be a bit wordy but is correct. There are some missing or incorrect punctuation marks. The word "absolutsly" is misspelled as "absolutsly". Also, "deserfed" should be "deserted". There's a typo in "opht side" instead of "left side". "Apopldxy" is misspelled as "apoplexy". "Se may think" should be "He may think". "Notvout of reason" is missing a space. "Not unpleasant contrast" might need a hyphen. "The kpium den" has a typo for "opium". "Fromcthe life" is missing a space. "Conceaoed" should be "concealed". "There arectwo specimens" has a typo. "Thebsupernormal" should be "the supernatural". 

Now, for coherence, I need to assess how well the story is structured and how logically it flows. The story is an analysis of Dickens's plot, so the structure should follow a logical progression. The introduction sets up the context, then moves into character analysis, the opening of the tale, and specific scenes. 

However, there are some abrupt shifts. The transition from the introduction to the characters might be a bit jarring. Also, the story jumps from discussing characters to specific scenes without clear transitions. Some sections, like the part about Mr. Sapsea and Durdpes, might be unclear in their connection to the main analysis. The mention of "The Signalman" in the preface might be a bit out of place. Additionally, the conclusion about the analysis isn't clearly tied back to the initial thesis.

For fluency score, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that affect readability, but the overall text is mostly understandable. So maybe a 3 or 4. For coherence, the structure is somewhat logical but has some abrupt shifts and unclear connections. So maybe a 3 or 4 as well.

Wait, the user wants bullet points for each issue with labels. Let me list them out properly. For fluency, the spelling errors and typos are [SPELLING], missing spaces [SPELLING], incorrect word choice [LEXICON], and some awkward phrasing [SYNTAX]. For coherence, the abrupt shifts are [STRUCTURE], unclear connections [LOGIC], and some sections feeling disjointed [COHERENCE].

Considering the scale, fluency has several errors that hinder flow but not too many to make it incoherent, so maybe a 3. Coherence has some issues with structure and logic, so also a 3. But I need to check the scale again. Score 3 for fluency is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow." Yes, the story is mostly fluent but has enough errors to lower it to 3. For coherence, 3 is "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved." The story does have some shifts and unclear parts, so 3 seems right.

Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Misspellings: "absolutsly" (should be "absolutely"), "deserfed" (should be "deserted"), "opht" (should be "left"), "apopldxy" (should be "apoplexy"), "notvout" (should be "not out"), "kpium" (should be "opium"), "conceaoed" (should be "concealed"), "thebsupernormal" (should be "the supernatural").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises" (misspelled "and"), "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _romam policier_, careful study of character" (run-on sentence).  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between sections (e.g., from character analysis to "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" without clear linkage).  
- [LOGIC] Unresolved ambiguities: The connection between "The Signalman" and the main analysis is unclear.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references: "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests fhat she is the mother of John Jasper" (misspelled "that") and "the auld mysterie" (archaic phrasing without context).  
- [SPELLING] Missing spaces: "fromcthe life," "notvout of reason," "there arectwo specimens."  
- [LEXICON] Non-idiomatic expressions: "smacked of the apoplexy," "gracious fooling," "the more closely one studies Edwin."  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
