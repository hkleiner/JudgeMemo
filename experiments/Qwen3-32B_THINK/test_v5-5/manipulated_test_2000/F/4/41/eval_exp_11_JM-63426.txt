Okay, I'm going to rate the story according to the evaluation criteria for fluency and coherence. Let me first understand the task thoroughly.

The story is a long text about Will Bradley, an American graphic artist. I need to identify issues in the text that affect fluency and coherence and rate them on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, I'll look at fluency issues:
- Fluency assesses how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.
- I'll look for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues.

Looking at the text:
- There are several spelling errors: "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "wmes" instead of "were", "derivative" is misspelled as "derivative" (but it's correct), "cderivative" (a typo), "emriched" instead of "enriched", "om" instead of "on", "im" instead of "in", "coveref" instead of "covered", "ism" as part of "ismsitting", "wre" instead of "were", "rethrn" instead of "return", "cemts" instead of "cents", "pi" instead of "ink", "prrss" instead of "press", "eay" instead of "every", "shen" instead of "when", "qant" instead of "want", "Youngo" instead of "Young go", "toing" instead of "going", "Bkston" instead of "Boston", "wzit" instead of "wait", "esucation" instead of "education", "cTeacher" instead of "The teacher", "freauently" instead of "frequently", "prdss" instead of "press", "boardcand" instead of "board and", "advance isbalways" instead of "advance is always", "amfive" instead of "a five", "flaee" instead of "flame".

- There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing: "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." This is awkward phrasing.
- "There werecderivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?" The "werecderivative" is a typo, but the sentence structure is also a bit awkward.
- "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." This sentence is a bit awkward.
- "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body, and it thrilled him to speak to thousands, even millions, instead of just scores." This is a bit wordy.

Now for coherence:
- Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, focusing on logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure.

Looking at the text:
- The story jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions, which can make it confusing.
- The narrative moves from the introduction to the boyhood of Will Bradley, but the connection between these sections is not always clear.
- Some ideas are introduced and then not fully developed or explained, such as the impact of Bradley's work on his time.
- There are some abrupt shifts in focus, such as the detailed description of the newspaper shop in Ishpeming that seems to come out of nowhere in the middle of the story.
- The ending is a bit abrupt with the description of a scene at the newspaper office, which doesn't seem to tie back to the introduction.

Now I'll rate these issues on the scale:

For fluency:
- The text has many spelling errors and some grammatical issues, but it's still mostly understandable.
- The errors are numerous but not so severe that they completely hinder understanding.
- I would rate this as a 3 - "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text."

For coherence:
- The text has a general narrative about Will Bradley's life and impact, but there are some issues with logical sequencing and transitions.
- Some sections feel disconnected or out of place.
- I would rate this as a 3 - "Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text."

Let me double-check my ratings against the scale descriptions to make sure they align correctly.

Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors throughout the text: "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "wmes" instead of "were", "cderivative" (typo), "emriched" instead of "enriched", "om" instead of "on", "im" instead of "in", "coveref" instead of "covered", "ismsitting", "wre" instead of "were", "rethrn" instead of "return", "cemts" instead of "cents", "pi" instead of "ink", "prrss" instead of "press", "eay" instead of "every", "shen" instead of "when", "qant" instead of "want", "Youngo" instead of "Young go", "toing" instead of "going", "Bkston" instead of "Boston", "wzit" instead of "wait", "esucation" instead of "education", "cTeacher" instead of "The teacher", "freauently" instead of "frequently", "prdss" instead of "press", "boardcand" instead of "board and", "advance isbalways" instead of "advance is always", "amfive" instead of "a five", "flaee" instead of "flame".
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in sentences like: "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward sentence structure: "There werecderivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?"
- [LEXICON] Awkward word choice: "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too."
- [COHERENCE] Jumps between time periods and locations without clear transitions.
- [COHERENCE] The narrative moves from the introduction to the boyhood of Will Bradley without clear connection.
- [COHERENCE] Ideas introduced but not fully developed, such as the impact of Bradley's work on his time.
- [COHERENCE] Abrupt shifts in focus, such as the detailed description of the newspaper shop in Ishpeming.
- [COHERENCE] The ending is abrupt with the description of a scene at the newspaper office that doesn't tie back to the introduction.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
