Okay, let's start by reading the given story and the evaluation criteria. The user wants me to rate the story for coherence and fluency on a scale from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to identify the issues in the story under the categories of coherence and fluency. Let's go through the text step by step.

Looking at fluency first. The main aspects here are grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I'll scan for any obvious errors. 

I notice some spelling mistakes like "seej" instead of "seen", "afger" instead of "after", "xnd" instead of "and", "waw" instead of "was", "tuey" instead of "they", "Standint" instead of "Standing", "reavhed" instead of "reached", "vety" instead of "very", "librwry" instead of "library", "Myerw" instead of "Myers", and "evwrything" instead of "everything". These are clear spelling errors. 

There are also some typos like "bu tye rector" which should be "by the rector", "as wdll as" instead of "as well as", "ofteb" instead of "often", "a finebfreedom" which is "a fine freedom", "xven" instead of "seven", and "withvthe" instead of "with the". These are spelling and typo issues. 

Looking at syntax, some sentences are a bit awkward but not too bad. For example, "It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canyerville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575." That's a long sentence but grammatically correct. 

Now for coherence. The story is about the Otis family moving into a haunted house and their interactions with the ghost. The flow seems logical. Each chapter builds on the previous one. The introduction of characters and the ghost's appearance are well-structured. However, I need to check for any abrupt shifts or inconsistencies. 

The transition from the first chapter to the second is smooth. The ghost's introduction and the family's reaction are consistent. There's a clear progression in the story: the family arrives, encounters the blood stain, the ghost appears, and the Minister's reaction. 

But wait, in the second chapter, the ghost appears suddenly after the family's discussion about non-supernatural topics. That might be a bit abrupt, but it's part of the narrative to show the ghost's appearance despite their disbelief. So maybe that's intentional and not a coherence issue. 

Are there any logical gaps? The story explains the ghost's presence and the family's skepticism, so the events follow logically. The repetition of the blood stain and the ghost's reaction are consistent with the established plot. 

So for coherence, the story is well-structured, with a clear progression. For fluency, the spelling errors and typos are numerous but don't severely hinder understanding. However, they do affect the overall fluency. 

Now, applying the scoring scales. 

For fluency: The story has several spelling errors and typos. According to the scale, a score of 3 is "Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text." The errors here are spelling and typos, which are grammatical issues. The text is still readable, but the errors are noticeable and affect the flow. So maybe a 3. 

For coherence: The story is well-structured, with a logical progression. There are no major inconsistencies or abrupt shifts. The narrative builds up the events coherently. So a 5 might be too high because there are minor issues, but the story is mostly coherent. However, looking at the evaluation criteria, a score of 5 is "Entirely coherent, well-structured and well-organized, building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information." The story does that. The only possible minor issues might be some awkward phrasing, but the overall structure is solid. So maybe a 5 for coherence. 

Wait, but the user's example might have different reasoning. Let me check again. The example given in the task has a story with some issues but scores high. In this case, the story is a classic like "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, but here there are typos. The original story is coherent and fluent, but in this version, the errors are present. 

So, considering the errors, the fluency is affected but not so much that it's hard to read. Coherence is maintained despite the errors. Therefore, coherence could still be a 5 because the structure and logic are sound. Fluency is a 3 due to the multiple spelling and typo errors that hinder the flow.

Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "seej" should be "seen", "afger" should be "after", "xnd" should be "and", "waw" should be "was", "tuey" should be "they", "Standint" should be "Standing", "reavhed" should be "reached", "vety" should be "very", "librwry" should be "library", "Myerw" should be "Myers", "evwrything" should be "everything".  
- [TYPOGRAPHY] "bu tye rector" should be "by the rector", "as wdll as" should be "as well as", "ofteb" should be "often", "a finebfreedom" should be "a fine freedom", "xven" should be "seven", "withvthe" should be "with the".  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex but grammatically correct (e.g., long description of Lady Eleanore de Canterville).  
- [LOGIC] The repetition of the blood-stain and the ghostâ€™s sudden appearance are consistent with the narrative but may feel abrupt to some readers.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
