Let me analyze the story according to the evaluation criteria of coherence and fluency.

First, I'll identify issues with coherence:

[LOGIC] - The story presents a theory about the Garden of Eden being located in the Mississippi River valley, but the logical connections between the evidence and the conclusion are weak. The author draws many speculative connections between biblical references and geographical features without clear justification.

[STRUCTURE] - The story lacks a clear, logical structure. It jumps between different topics and ideas without clear transitions or organization. The narrative is disjointed and meandering.

[CLARITY] - The story is often unclear in its reasoning. The author makes many claims without sufficient explanation or evidence to support them. The logic is frequently circular (e.g., "This must be Eden because it fits the biblical description, and it fits the biblical description because it's Eden").

[TRANSITION] - The story lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas. It often jumps abruptly from one concept to another without connecting them.

[CONSISTENCY] - The story is inconsistent in its arguments. For example, it claims to be presenting factual discoveries while simultaneously acknowledging that some people mock the idea.

Now for issues with fluency:

[GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example: "have ventured to publish it" (missing subject), "he simply stated the princopak facts" (misspelling), "it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them" (awkward construction).

[SPELLING] - There are many spelling errors: "antldiluvians", "princopak", "locayion", "cohsequently", "thr", "prlper dimentions", "investigatikn", "ingenuoty", "euphony", "Havilah", "Bridtish", "Thjs vast aeea", "innabited", "thr", "throughmwhich", "hightest", "dor", "scwttered", "jt", "oit", "Ligerally", "separate andcdistinct", "endkess", "wagged", "wlmost".

[SYNTAX] - The text has many awkward syntactic constructions and run-on sentences. For example: "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr 'North West,' as the place."

[LEXICON] - There are inappropriate word choices and misuse of vocabulary. For example: "inhabited by the most industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the world" (the word "christianized" is not commonly used in this context).

[PUNCTUATION] - The text has inconsistent and often incorrect punctuation, including missing commas, periods, and quotation marks.

Based on my analysis:

Coherence Score: 2
- The story has some logical flow and organization, but there are many disconnected parts and inconsistencies. The narrative is often unclear and the logic is weak. While the overall context is somewhat understandable with effort, the story fails to build a coherent argument.

Fluency Score: 2
- The text contains many major grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward syntax that significantly hinder readability. While there are some fluent segments, the numerous errors and awkward phrasing make the text difficult to follow.

So my final evaluation is:
Issues: [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION], [CONSISTENCY], [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], [PUNCTUATION]
FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
