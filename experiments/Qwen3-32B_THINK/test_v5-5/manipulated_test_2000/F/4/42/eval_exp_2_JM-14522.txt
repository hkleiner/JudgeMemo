Alright, I need to rate the story based on Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by understanding the evaluation criteria.

For Coherence, I need to check if the story is logically structured, ideas are connected smoothly, and there are no abrupt shifts or inconsistencies. For Fluency, I'll look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking at the story, it's a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The text is in the public domain, so it's a well-known work. However, the user wants me to evaluate it as if it were a human-written story for the first time.

**Coherence:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured, following a clear narrative about the Otis family's experience with the haunted Canterville Chase.
2. [LOGIC] The plot is logical and follows a clear sequence of events, with a beginning (introduction of the haunted house), middle (the family's attempts to deal with the ghost), and end (the ghost's appearance and the family's reaction).
3. [CLARITY] The story is clear and easy to follow, with well-defined characters and a coherent plot.
4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between scenes and paragraphs are smooth and natural.
