Alright, I need to evaluate the provided story according to the given criteria of Coherence and Fluency on a 5-point scale. Let me first understand the definitions and scoring criteria.

For Coherence:
- It assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, looking at logical sequence, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and narrative consistency and structure.
- Score 5: Entirely coherent, well-structured and well-organized, building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information.
- Score 4: Only containing some minor disconnected parts that basically do not affect the overall coherence.
- Score 3: Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.
- Score 2: Many disconnected parts and inconsistencies, but the overall context could be understandable with some effort.
- Score 1: Not coherent at all, many logical gaps, no progression, and many sections that feel disjointed or out of sync with the rest.

For Fluency:
- It assesses how the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.
- Score 5: Entirely fluent, grammatically correct, and well written.
- Score 4: Only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect.
- Score 3: Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow.
- Score 2: Major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.
- Score 1: Not fluent at all, full of meaningless fragments and unclear contents.

Now, let me analyze the story for issues in both coherence and fluency.
