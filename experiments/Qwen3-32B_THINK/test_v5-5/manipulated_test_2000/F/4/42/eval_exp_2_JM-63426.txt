Let me analyze the story according to the evaluation criteria for Coherence and Fluency.

First, I'll identify issues with coherence (how well the story unfolds as a whole, with logical sequence, clear progression, etc.):

[LOGIC] - The story jumps between different narrative perspectives and timeframes without clear transitions. It starts as an introduction to Will Bradley's chap book, then shifts to a detailed account of Bradley's childhood and career, and ends with a scene that seems to be cut off mid-sentence.

[STRUCTURE] - The narrative structure is disjointed. The first chapter is a biographical introduction, while the second chapter is a detailed account of Bradley's childhood. There's no clear narrative arc or progression.

[CLARITY] - Some passages are unclear or confusing. For example, "He may had had some such idea in mind" and "it don’t worked" are grammatically incorrect and make the meaning unclear.

[TRANSITION] - There are no smooth transitions between the different sections of the story. The shift from the introduction to the childhood narrative is abrupt.

Now, I'll identify issues with fluency (how the text reads from start to finish, with focus on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc.):

[GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. Examples include "It shoulded be talked about," "it is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep," "Bradley may had had some such idea," and "it don’t worked."

[SYNTAX] - The sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he take off into a career" has an inconsistency in tense.

[LEXICON] - There are some inappropriate word choices. For example, "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston" uses "was" incorrectly when it should be "were."

[PUNCTUATION] - There are punctuation issues throughout the text. For example, the use of em dashes without proper punctuation and the lack of commas in complex sentences.

Let me now score the story:

For Coherence:
- The story has some logical progression in the childhood narrative, but the overall structure is disjointed.
- The narrative jumps between different timeframes and perspectives without clear transitions.
- There are some clarity issues that affect the overall coherence.
I would give a Coherence Score of 3 - Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.

For Fluency:
- There are numerous grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text.
- The sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect.
- There are issues with word choice and punctuation.
I would give a Fluency Score of 3 - Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text.

- [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or confusing due to grammatical errors, such as "He may had had some such idea" and "it don’t worked."
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the different sections of the story, particularly between the introduction and the childhood narrative.
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including "It shoulded be talked about," "Bradley may had had some such idea," and "it don’t worked."
