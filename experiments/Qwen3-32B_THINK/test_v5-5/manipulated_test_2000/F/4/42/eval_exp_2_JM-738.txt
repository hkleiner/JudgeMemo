Okay, let's start by reading the story to understand what's going on. The story is about analyzing Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," discussing its plot, characters, and the theories around its unresolved ending. The user wants me to evaluate the story's coherence and fluency using the given criteria.

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through the text.

I notice some instances where the past tense is missing. For example, "he certainly write no longer" should be "he certainly wrote no longer." There's also "He speak to his sister-in-law" which should be "He spoke." Another one is "he left his secret as a puzzle to the curious. Many efforts have been make to decipher..." which should be "have been made."

There are also some spelling errors. For example, "babbleed" instead of "babblinged," "opiumed" instead of "opium," and "babblinged" seems like a typo. Also, "has am a victim" and "has am a determined drunkard" should be "has been a victim" and "has been a determined drunkard."

In terms of word choice, "Youth will was served" might be a confusing phrase. Maybe "Youth was served" is intended. Also, "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel..." is a bit awkward. Maybe rephrase to "while combining elements of the detective novel with careful study of character."

Now for coherence. The story is a critical analysis, so the structure should be logical. The introduction sets up the discussion of Dickens's construction in his later novels, then moves to his health and the creation of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." Then it discusses characters and theories. The flow seems logical, but there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from discussing Dickens's health to the characters in the story might be a bit jarring. Also, some parts are a bit dense and could be more clearly explained, like the part about Jasper's opium use and the theories around Edwin's fate.

The characters are introduced, but some relationships are a bit confusing. For example, the connection between John Jasper and the Princess Puffer is unclear. Also, the mention of theories by Proctor and Walters is present but might not be fully explained for a reader unfamiliar with the novel.

Overall, the story is coherent in its main argument about Dickens's construction and the mystery of the novel, but there are some coherence issues in transitions and clarity of certain points. The fluency has several grammatical and spelling errors that affect readability but don't completely hinder understanding.
