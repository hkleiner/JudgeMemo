Okay, I need to evaluate this story according to the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, the story is a theological treatise about the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper, specifically addressing the Real Presence. It's quite dense with religious terminology and arguments, so I need to check how well the ideas flow and if the structure makes sense.

Looking at Coherence: The text is divided into chapters and sections, which is a good structure. However, there are some abrupt shifts in ideas. For example, the introduction sets up the context, but then the main body starts with a detailed discussion of the Real Presence without clear transitions. Also, some paragraphs are very long and complex, making it hard to follow the logical progression. The author mentions examining the Articles, Catechism, etc., but the flow between these sections isn't always smooth. There are also some points where the argument seems to jump without sufficient explanation, like when discussing the differences between Rome and the Church of England. The conclusion of the article on the Articles is cut off, which might be a formatting issue but affects the overall coherence.

For Fluency: The text has several grammatical errors. For instance, "is teach by the Church of England" should be "is taught by". There are instances of incorrect verb tenses, like "they am the true expositors" instead of "they are". Also, some sentences have awkward phrasing, such as "the point was supposed to had been settle by the Church" which should be "to have been settled". The use of passive voice is heavy, which can make the text feel less direct. Additionally, there are missing articles and prepositions, like "the assertion that she teaches what is commonly called ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence’" should probably have "the" before "Doctrine". The sentence structure in some places is convoluted, making it difficult to parse the intended meaning. For example, "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not referred, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." The verb tenses here are inconsistent ("refer, or do not referred").

Now, applying the scoring scales. For Coherence, the text is generally coherent with a clear structure, but the abrupt shifts and some unclear transitions lower the score. The logical flow is mostly there but not perfect. I'd say it's a 3. For Fluency, the grammatical errors are numerous and affect readability. While some are minor, others are more significant and disrupt the flow. The score here would be a 3 as well, since the text is mostly fluent but has enough errors to hinder smooth reading.

Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "is teach" instead of "is taught," "they am" instead of "they are," "we was taught" instead of "we were taught").  
[SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "the point was supposed to had been settle" instead of "to have been settled," "do not referred" instead of "do not refer").  
[LEXICON] Missing articles/prepositions (e.g., "the assertion that she teaches what is commonly called ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence’" lacks "the" before "Doctrine").  
[LOGIC] Abrupt shifts in argumentation (e.g., moving from the Church of England's stance to Rome’s doctrine without clear transitions).  
[STRUCTURE] Long, dense paragraphs with unclear progression; conclusion of the "Articles" section is cut off.  
[TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between sections (e.g., from introduction to Chapter I, or between doctrinal points).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
