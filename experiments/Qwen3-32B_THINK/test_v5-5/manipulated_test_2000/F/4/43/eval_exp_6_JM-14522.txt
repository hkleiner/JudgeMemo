Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the provided story and then assess it for coherence and fluency using the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The story is a chapter from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The user provided a text that seems to be a mix of the original text and some corrupted or altered parts. For example, there's a paragraph that starts with "I it at short ghost money that..." which is clearly a jumbled sentence. There are also other instances where sentences don't make sense, like "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed." These are obvious grammatical errors and nonsensical phrases that disrupt the flow. Additionally, there's a section where the chapter title is "CHAPTER: nothing" followed by a fragmented sentence: "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred." These issues would lower the fluency score significantly.

Now for coherence. The story's main plot is about the Otis family moving into a haunted house. However, some parts are disjointed. The corrupted sections, like the jumbled sentences, create logical gaps. The transition between chapters is abrupt, especially the "CHAPTER: nothing" part, which doesn't follow the previous chapter's structure. Also, some narrative elements don't connect well, such as the sudden appearance of the ghost and the family's reactions without proper buildup. The coherence is further hindered by the incoherent parts that make it hard to follow the story's progression.

Putting this all together, the fluency issues are numerous and severe, leading to a low score. The coherence is affected by these same issues, making the story hard to follow in parts. I'll need to categorize each problem under the appropriate labels and assign scores based on the given scales.
