I'll analyze the given story according to the evaluation criteria of Coherence and Fluency.

First, let me understand what I'm looking for:
- Coherence: How well the story flows as a whole, with logical sequencing, clear progression, and consistent structure.
- Fluency: How well-written the individual sentences are, with proper grammar, syntax, and word choice.

Looking at the story:

**Coherence Issues:**
[STRUCTURE] The story has two main chapters: "An Introduction" and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." While these are distinct sections, the transition between them is abrupt without clear connection.
[LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions. The first chapter discusses Bradley's influence on graphic arts and the second chapter is about his early life, but there's no smooth connection between these perspectives.
[LOGIC] Some historical references and context are unclear. For example, the references to "Kelmscott House" and various artists and movements might be obscure to readers unfamiliar with the subject.
[CLARITY] There are some confusing phrases and sentences that make it difficult to follow the narrative flow.

**Fluency Issues:**
[GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text.
[SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward syntax or structure that makes them hard to understand.
[LEXICON] There are instances of inappropriate word choice or misuse.
[SPELLING] There are spelling errors in the text.
[SENTENCE STRUCTURE] Some sentences are run-on or have incomplete thoughts.

Specific fluency issues I notice:
1. "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a series of word fragments.
2. "Your for house your mother keeps cousins." - This sentence is confusing and grammatically incorrect.
3. "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." - This appears to be a garbled sentence fragment.
4. There are several instances of missing articles, prepositions, or other grammatical elements.
5. Some sentences are run-on or have awkward phrasing that disrupts the flow.
6. The phrase "bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar "version old pretends." appears to be a garbled or incomplete sentence.

Based on my analysis:
- For Coherence: The story has some logical issues and abrupt transitions between sections, but it does follow a general narrative flow about Will Bradley. I would rate this as a 3 - Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.
- For Fluency: There are significant grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and incoherent segments throughout the text. Some of the issues appear to be severe enough to hinder comprehension. I would rate this as a 2 - There are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

Now I'll format my response according to the requested format.

Issues: [STRUCTURE] The story has two distinct chapters with an abrupt transition between them. [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions. [LOGIC] Some historical references and context are unclear to general readers. [CLARITY] There are confusing phrases and sentences that disrupt the narrative flow. [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors appear throughout the text. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward syntax or structure. [LEXICON] There are instances of inappropriate word choice or misuse. [SPELLING] Spelling errors are present in the text. [SENTENCE STRUCTURE] Some sentences are run-on or have incomplete thoughts. Notably, "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work" is completely incoherent. "Your for house your mother keeps cousins" is confusing and grammatically incorrect. "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do" appears to be a garbled sentence fragment. There are several instances of missing articles, prepositions, or other grammatical elements.
FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
