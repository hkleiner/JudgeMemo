Okay, I need to evaluate this story for coherence and fluency. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

First, the story is about the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River region. The structure seems a bit all over the place. The author jumps from explaining their discovery process to describing the geography, then to some historical references and even a mention of rattlesnakes. There are parts where the narrative is interrupted by lists of names and places, which might not flow well. The ending has a paragraph that's almost incomprehensible, with sentences like "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to..." That's definitely a problem for coherence.

Looking at fluency, there are several grammatical errors. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." The "CHAPTER" in all caps is probably a typo. There's also "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" – "admirirg" should be "admiring." The word "dimentions" is misspelled as "dimentions." Other instances include "antldiluvians" which should be "antediluvians," and "Bridtish" instead of "British." Punctuation is inconsistent, with commas and periods sometimes missing or misplaced. For example, "And this hanging garden has been notable and notorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their Indian name 'rattlesnake hills,' and including Mount Trempealeau, (a separate and distinct pyramid) was formerly 'Literally alive with rattlesnakes.'" The parentheses and capitalization here are awkward.

Coherence-wise, the story starts with the author's motivation, then moves to the location, but the transitions between ideas are abrupt. The author mentions the Garden of Eden in America but doesn't clearly connect the geographical features to the biblical description. There are also some logical inconsistencies, like claiming the Mississippi is the Euphrates without sufficient justification. The mention of "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river..." is confusing and doesn't flow well into the rest of the text. The final paragraph about La Crosse and the rivers is a bit disjointed, making the overall argument hard to follow.

In terms of structure, the story lacks a clear progression. The author introduces the idea, then goes into the discovery process, then the geography, then historical settlers, and then back to the garden's features. There's a lack of smooth transitions between these sections, which affects coherence. Also, the conclusion doesn't wrap up the argument effectively; it just ends with a description of the city and rivers, leaving the reader without a clear takeaway.

For fluency, the repeated grammatical errors and awkward phrasing definitely hinder the flow. The misspellings and incorrect word choices make reading difficult. Some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation, making them hard to parse. The use of all caps for "CHAPTER" is also jarring and unprofessional.

Overall, the story has some interesting ideas but is let down by poor structure, logical inconsistencies, and numerous grammatical errors. The coherence score would be low due to the disjointed narrative and lack of clear progression. The fluency score is also low because of the many errors affecting readability.

Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Numerous grammatical errors such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", and "Bridtish" instead of "British".  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences, e.g., "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place."  
[LOGIC] - Inconsistent logic and unclear connections between the biblical Garden of Eden and the described Mississippi River location, e.g., equating the Mississippi with the Euphrates without sufficient justification.  
[TRANSITION] - Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas, e.g., shifting from the author's discovery process to historical settlers without clear linkage.  
[CLARITY] - Unclear or confusing phrases, e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to..."  
[STRUCTURE] - Disjointed narrative structure with repetitive and disorganized sections, e.g., the final paragraph about La Crosse and rivers lacks a clear progression.  
[PUNCTUATION] - Inconsistent or missing punctuation, e.g., misplaced commas and periods in sentences like "And this hanging garden has been notable and notorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their Indian name 'rattlesnake hills,' and including Mount Trempealeau, (a separate and distinct pyramid) was formerly 'Literally alive with rattlesnakes.'"
