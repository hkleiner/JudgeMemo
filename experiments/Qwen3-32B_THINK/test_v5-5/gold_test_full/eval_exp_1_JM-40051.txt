Okay, I need to evaluate the given story based on Coherence and Fluency using the provided criteria. Let's start by understanding what each metric entails.

For Coherence, I need to check if the story is logically structured, with ideas smoothly connected and a clear progression. Are there abrupt shifts or unclear parts that make it hard to follow? The story is about identifying a place in America as the Garden of Eden. I'll look for how well the argument is structured, whether the points logically follow each other, and if there are any inconsistencies or missing links.

For Fluency, I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Are there any errors that disrupt the flow? The text seems quite long and detailed, so I'll need to scan for any awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, or grammatical mistakes.

Now, let's read through the story and note any issues. The story is written in a somewhat archaic and verbose style, which might affect fluency. There are several instances of run-on sentences, missing commas, and some awkward phrasing. For example, "But by degrees it has  been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent;" has an extra space and a missing comma. Also, "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" has a typo.

In terms of coherence, the story presents a central argument but sometimes jumps between points without clear transitions. For example, it starts with the author's discovery, then goes into biblical references, geographical descriptions, historical anecdotes, and scientific claims, which can make the narrative feel disjointed. There are also some abrupt shifts in perspective and topics, which might confuse the reader. The author uses a lot of specific details about the landscape, but the connection between these details and the main argument isn't always clear. Additionally, the conclusion brings in references to dairying and geological surveys which seem a bit out of place in the context of locating the Garden of Eden.

Now, let's categorize the issues:

[GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors like missing commas, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. For example, "But by degrees it has  been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent;" should have a comma after "some" and the extra space between "has" and "been" should be corrected.

[SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and run-on, making them hard to follow. For example, "And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of electricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly in our garden, on a hot day, because of its “much water,” so, doubtless, we shall always have our full quota of thunder storms." This sentence is too long and lacks proper punctuation.

[LEXICON] There are some awkward word choices and repetitions. For example, "The scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand," could be more concise.

[LOGIC] The argument sometimes lacks logical flow. For example, the transition from discussing the geographical features to dairying and geological surveys is abrupt and doesn't clearly support the main thesis.

[STRUCTURE] The story's structure is somewhat disjointed, with sections that jump between different topics without clear transitions. The author moves from biblical references to geographical descriptions to historical anecdotes without smooth connections.

[CLARITY] Some parts are unclear or overly verbose. For example, the explanation about cyclones and the garden's protection is complex and could be more clearly presented.

Now, assigning scores:

For Coherence: The story has a central theme but the structure is somewhat disjointed with abrupt shifts and unclear connections between some sections. There are logical gaps and the argument could be more tightly structured. So, I'd say a 3.

For Fluency: There are numerous grammatical errors, run-on sentences, and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow. The text is not entirely fluent, but the main ideas are still understandable despite the errors. So, a 3 as well.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors, including missing commas, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and run-on sentences disrupt readability.  
- [LEXICON] Awkward word choices and repetitions (e.g., "admirirg", "dimentions").  
- [LOGIC] Logical gaps and abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from biblical references to dairying and geological surveys).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure with unclear transitions between sections.  
- [CLARITY] Verbose explanations and unclear connections between details and the main argument.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
