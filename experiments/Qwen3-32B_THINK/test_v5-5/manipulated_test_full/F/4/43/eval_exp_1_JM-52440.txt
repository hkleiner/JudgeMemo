Alright, let's go through this story and evaluate it based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency.

First, I'll read through the story to understand its content and structure. This is a religious text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's written in a formal, theological style with extensive references to religious documents and teachings.

Now, I'll evaluate for Coherence, which focuses on how the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure.

Looking at the story:
- The text is organized into chapters and sections, with clear headings for each major topic (Introduction, Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice).
- There is a clear progression through the topics, starting with an introduction and moving through specific doctrines.
- The arguments are built on logical foundations, with references to specific documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies) to support the author's position.
- However, there are some issues with coherence:
  - The text is dense and complex, with many theological concepts that may be difficult for general readers to follow.
  - Some paragraphs are very long and could benefit from clearer transitions or subheadings to improve readability.
  - There are a few instances where the flow of the argument is disrupted by digressions or overly complex sentences.

Now, I'll evaluate for Fluency, which focuses on how the text reads from start to finish, with attention to syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking at the story:
- The text is written in an archaic or formal style, with complex sentence structures.
- There are some grammatical issues:
  - There are a few instances of missing or incorrect punctuation.
  - Some sentences have awkward phrasing or word order that makes them difficult to understand.
  - There are a few instances of missing words or incomplete sentences.
- There are some spelling errors or unusual word choices that could be improved.
- The text uses archaic language that may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which is appropriate for the subject matter but can affect readability.

Specific issues I've noticed:

[COHERENCE]
- Some sections are very dense with information and could benefit from clearer organization.
- The argument sometimes shifts between different levels of abstraction without clear transitions.
- The text could benefit from more concise explanations of complex theological concepts.

[FLUENCY]
- [GRAMMAR]: There are a few grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb forms.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences are overly complex or have awkward structure that makes them difficult to follow.
- [WORD CHOICE]: The text uses archaic or formal language that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [PUNCTUATION]: There are a few instances where punctuation is missing or used incorrectly.
- [TYPOGRAPHY]: There are some typographical errors or missing words in the text.

Based on these observations, I'll assign scores:

For Coherence: The text is generally coherent with a clear structure and logical progression, but the dense content and complex sentence structures could make it challenging for some readers to follow. I'll give it a 4.

For Fluency: The text has some fluency issues, particularly with complex sentence structures and archaic language, but it is still generally readable for its intended audience. I'll give it a 3.

Issues: 
- [COHERENCE] The text is dense with complex theological arguments that may be difficult for general readers to follow.
- [COHERENCE] Some paragraphs are excessively long and could benefit from clearer transitions between ideas.
- [COHERENCE] The argument sometimes shifts between different levels of abstraction without clear signposting.
- [FLUENCY] [GRAMMAR] There are a few grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb forms.
- [FLUENCY] [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex or have awkward structure that hinders readability.
- [FLUENCY] [WORD CHOICE] The text uses archaic or formal language that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [FLUENCY] [PUNCTUATION] There are a few instances where punctuation is missing or used incorrectly.
- [FLUENCY] [TYPOGRAPHY] There are some typographical errors or missing words in the text.
