Alright, let me go through this story and evaluate it based on the given criteria. I'll start by analyzing the coherence and fluency.

For coherence, I need to check if the story flows logically from one section to another, if there are clear connections between ideas, and if there are any abrupt shifts or inconsistencies. The story is about the mystery of Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," and it discusses various theories about the plot and characters. However, there are several issues with coherence:

1. [LOGIC] The story jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions. It often goes back and forth between different characters and plot points without a smooth narrative flow.
2. [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat disjointed, with sections that seem to be randomly ordered. The story moves from one theory to another without clear organization.
3. [CLARITY] Some parts are unclear or confusing. For example, the discussion of characters like Datchery and Helena Landless is often muddled and lacks clarity.
4. [TRANSITION] There are many abrupt transitions between ideas and sections. The reader is often left wondering how one topic connects to the next.

For fluency, I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and overall readability:

1. [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors throughout the text. For example, "He was certainly tried and condemned; for Dickens intended 'to take Mr. Fildes to a condemned cell in Maidstone, or some other gaol, in order to make a drawing.'" This sentence has issues with parallel structure and clarity.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted and difficult to follow. Many sentences are overly long and complex.
3. [SPELLING] I noticed a few spelling errors, though they are relatively minor compared to the other issues.
4. [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the context, but there are some instances of awkward or unclear word choices.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence as a 3 and the fluency as a 2. The story has some coherent elements, but the overall structure and flow are problematic. The fluency is significantly impacted by the grammatical errors and complex sentence structures.

Issues:  
[LOGIC] The narrative lacks a clear logical progression, with abrupt shifts between theories and sections. The flow is often disjointed, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
[STRUCTURE] The organization is chaotic, with sections that jump between characters, theories, and plot points without clear transitions or a unifying structure.  
[CLARITY] Many passages are confusing due to unclear explanations, ambiguous phrasing, and overly complex sentence structures. Key ideas are often muddled.  
[TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt or missing, leaving the reader disoriented.  
[GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect punctuation, hinder readability.  
[SYNTAX] Sentences are frequently convoluted, with run-on constructions and poor parallelism, making comprehension difficult.  
[LEXICON] Some word choices are awkward or inappropriate for the context, further complicating understanding.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
