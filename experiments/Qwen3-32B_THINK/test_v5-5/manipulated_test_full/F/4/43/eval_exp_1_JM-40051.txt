Let me analyze this story for coherence and fluency issues.

First, I'll look at coherence issues. Coherence is about how well the story flows and how logically connected the ideas are. The story is claiming to identify the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States based on biblical descriptions. The main coherence issues I see:

[LOGIC] The story makes logical leaps and assumptions without sufficient evidence. It claims the Garden of Eden is in a specific location based on a few superficial similarities to biblical descriptions, without addressing counterarguments or alternative interpretations.

[STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure. It jumps between different topics without clear transitions. The author describes the geography of the area, then discusses geological features, then shifts to religious interpretations, then back to geography, etc.

[CLARITY] Many parts of the text are unclear or confusing. For example: "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT..." - the "CHAPTER" label doesn't make sense here.

[TRANSITION] There are poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas. The story often moves abruptly from one topic to another without clear connections.

[CONSISTENCY] The story is inconsistent in its arguments. It claims to be presenting a "discovery" but then contradicts itself in various places.

Now for fluency issues. Fluency is about grammatical correctness, spelling, and sentence structure:

[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and misplaced modifiers.

[SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect. Many sentences are run-on or fragmented.

[SPELLING] There are spelling errors, such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", and "euphonious" instead of "euphonious".

[LEXICON] There are occasional word choice issues, where the wrong word is used for the context.

Let me identify some specific examples of these issues:

1. "In no continent flood to it any that which, on innocent mystery was as, the God little to, continent description it no resided location time he, man family the the new one, to nor thus consequently in out or—and and been how Noah the the, of a principal facts that one and not—giving stated destroyed a him the on and to, to of how a his, since the country, admitted mankind and present location creation; it of the point find being, then them, a somewhere description not be gave; could, has first, and themselves simply knew where was kept, it was able them of with he antldiluvians cause location, and all earth corrupted though then profound speculation on."

This paragraph is completely incoherent and unreadable. The words are strung together without logical connections, making it impossible to understand.

2. "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place."

This sentence is grammatically correct but the metaphor "finger of time" is awkward and the meaning is unclear.

3. "Of course I had never given it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or might be its proper dimentions."

"Dimention" is misspelled as "dimentions".

4. "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large."

There are several grammatical issues here, including a missing article ("a suggestion") and a missing comma before "at which".

5. "Since of commenced idea not have my, but with reality possible, while are claiming mocked, publish becoming the to possible only others a being views impressed some its, highly I probable."

This sentence is completely incoherent and unreadable.

6. "Where would a scientest place the first pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth?"

"Scientest" is misspelled as "scientest".

7. "Not too far not, north far too south."

This sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing.

8. "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream."

The sentence structure is awkward and the meaning is somewhat unclear.

9. "Our garden is again right. But it should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual growth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great Builder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect."

The transition from "Our garden is again right" to the next sentence is abrupt and confusing.

10. "But as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing."

This sentence is grammatically correct but the connection between Christians taking possession and the destruction of serpents is not clearly explained.

11. "The scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as do the great lakes."

This sentence is grammatically correct but the comparison to the great lakes is somewhat unclear.

12. "While of level there a an, yet the general, is what variety top topping bounding indescribable out."

This sentence is completely incoherent and unreadable.

13. "Cones, oblongs, smooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost endless variety."

"Jageed" is misspelled as "jageed".

14. "Near from beautiful the, flourishing electric Crosse smoke appropriately with church towers, of La lies extremity and with spires fringed, most lumber providentially city its its mills the; tall southern numerous and named. La Crosse—saying nothing of its being the name of an ancient game modernized—as here crosses the garden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline, may be seen coming in from the “far east,” making and containing the notable and once far-famed, “La Crosse valley”; on which is located the beautiful city of Sparta."

This is a long, run-on sentence with multiple grammatical issues and confusing structure.

15. "Just beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of Mormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden."

This sentence has a missing article ("the creek" should be "which creek").

16. "Now as we trace the wall to the left,—past the La Crosse valley, and first eastern gate—we discover another small line of opening through which runs Half-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians."

This sentence has a missing comma after the first em dash.

17. "The next bold heavy prominence is “King bluff.” Still tracing on, we notice some queer looking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer one the “Sugar Loaf,” a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and beckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is “Castle rock;” and to the left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,—the central and main eastern gate—with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in front of you, down which flows the notable “Black river,” appropriately named, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and divides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of timbered bottoms."

This is a long, run-on sentence with multiple grammatical issues.

18. "As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part turning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that grand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties itself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming French island, once the resort of counterfeiters."

The sentence structure is awkward and the word "inclosing" is misspelled as "inclosing".

19. "As you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is “Flemming’s creek,” or Lewis’ valley, a fertile valley, in which is located the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the head of the main valley is “Robinson’s,” or “Pine Hill,” between Black River Falls and Sparta."

The sentence has a missing article ("is" should be "are") and the possessive form "Lewis’ valley" is inconsistent with "Flemming’s creek".

20. "This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the bluff is “Peacock Pass,” and is just this side of North Bend, and though apparently so near, is some “twenty miles away.”"

This sentence has a missing article ("is" should be "are").

21. "This heavy point, at the left of Black river, is “Heuston’s Bluff,” the next best point from which to view this valley garden."

The possessive form "Black river" is missing an apostrophe.

22. "To the left and farther away, look at that great rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the veritable “Decora’s Peak,”
