Alright, let's take a look at this story. The user wants me to evaluate the story's coherence and fluency based on specific criteria and provide scores from 1 to 5.

First, I need to understand what coherence and fluency mean in this context. Coherence is about how well the story flows as a whole, with logical progression, clear ideas, and smooth transitions. Fluency is about the language itself—grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking at the story, it's a detailed description of a supposed Garden of Eden located in the Mississippi River area. The author uses a lot of geographical details and biblical references to support their claim. 

Starting with fluency: I notice several spelling mistakes. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians," "admirirg" is "admir[ing]," "dimentions" is "dimensions," "scientest" is "scientist," and "euphony" is "euphony." There are also some grammatical errors, like missing articles ("In gave the antldiluvians a description...") and incorrect verb tenses ("he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description..."). The syntax sometimes feels awkward, and there are a few instances where the sentence structure is confusing. However, despite these issues, the overall text is still understandable, and the main ideas come through. So I would say the fluency is a 3—fluently written in general but with some grammatical errors that hinder the flow.

Now for coherence: The story is quite long and detailed, but it follows a logical structure. The author introduces the premise, explains their reasoning based on biblical descriptions, describes the location and its features, and addresses counterarguments. However, there are some parts where the flow is abrupt. For example, the transition from discussing the geographical features to the geological age of the area is a bit jarring. Also, the story jumps between different points without clear transitions, which can make it hard to follow at times. The author also brings in a lot of information about the region's history, agriculture, and geological features, which, while interesting, don't always tie back to the main argument about the Garden of Eden. There are also some unclear references and assumptions that the reader should already know certain facts. Despite these issues, the overall narrative is structured and the main argument is clear. So I would rate the coherence as a 3—coherent in general but with some abrupt shifts and unclarity.

Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors such as "In gave the antldiluvians a description" (incorrect verb form), "he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description" (tense inconsistency), and missing articles ("the Euphrates river crosses that country").  
- [SPELLING] Spelling mistakes like "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "euphony" (euphony).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "by degrees it has been opened to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent."  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between ideas, e.g., shifting from geographical descriptions to geological claims without clear links.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "the finger of time has am plainly pointing") and overly verbose explanations that hinder readability.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sections, such as sudden shifts from biblical analysis to agricultural data about Wisconsin dairy production.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, e.g., jumping from "rattlesnakes" to "the Queen of Sheba" without logical connection.  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or obscure terms ("antideluvians," "Havilah") without context, confusing modern readers.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
