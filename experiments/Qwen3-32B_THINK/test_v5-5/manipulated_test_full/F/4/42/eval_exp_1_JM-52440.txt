Alright, I'm going to evaluate the given story based on the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency.

Let me first understand what I'm looking for in each category:

**Coherence** - This assesses how well the story unfolds as a whole. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, non-repetitive, smoothly connected, and if there's a clear progression from one section to another. I should look for logical gaps, abrupt jumps, or inconsistencies in the narrative.

**Fluency** - This focuses on the language itself - how the text reads from start to finish. I need to check for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation in individual sentences. I'm looking for awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, or anything that would make the text difficult to read smoothly.

Now, let me analyze the given story, which appears to be a theological treatise on the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper:

**Coherence Analysis:**

1. [LOGIC] The text is a dense theological argument with a clear structure. It begins with an introduction, then systematically examines the doctrine of the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. The logical progression is clear as it moves from one topic to the next.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured with clear chapter divisions. Each section focuses on a specific aspect of the doctrine, and the author builds their argument systematically.

3. [CLARITY] The author's thesis is clear: to examine whether the Church of England teaches the doctrine of the Real Presence. The text consistently returns to this central question.

4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are generally smooth. The author uses phrases like "Thus far I have examined..." and "But we cannot leave the subject there..." to guide the reader through the argument.

5. [CONNECTION] The text maintains a strong connection between its parts. The author consistently references earlier arguments when making new points.

6. [REPETITION] There is some repetition of key phrases and arguments for emphasis, which is appropriate in a theological treatise but could be slightly distracting.

7. [FOCUS] The text maintains a clear focus throughout. It does not veer off-topic or introduce unrelated ideas.

8. [PROGRESSION] The argument builds logically from one point to the next. The author examines each aspect of the doctrine in turn, providing evidence and analysis at each step.

9. [CONSISTENCY] The text is consistent in its argumentation. The author's position is clear and remains consistent throughout.

10. [COMPLEXITY] The text handles complex theological concepts, but it does so in a way that is generally accessible to readers familiar with the subject matter.

11. [PERSUASION] The author presents their argument persuasively, using evidence from church documents and logical reasoning to support their position.

12. [CONCLUSION] The conclusion effectively summarizes the argument and reiterates the author's position.

**Fluency Analysis:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors. For example:
   - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue..."
   - "we was taught by our Lord Himself"
   - "He was present in the bread and in the wine"
   - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating"
   - "If it were not there it might have been possible to have argued..."
   - "the curate shall instruct him that if he do truly repent himself..."
   - "The wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth..."
   - "If a man ... by just impediment do not receive the Sacrament..."
   - "If they are made one by the act of consecration, neither one nor the other can be received alone."

2. [SYNTAX] There are several instances of awkward or non-standard syntax:
   - "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question."
   - "Nor can there be any doubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (κοινωνία) of the body and blood of Christ is connected with the Lord’s Supper."
   - "The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner..."
   - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith."

3. [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors:
   - "I am not now making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is the great point to be determined."
   - "It may seem strange at first sight that any persons should be eager to maintain that the wicked receive so sacred a gift..."
   - "I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles, but I am persuaded he will gain nothing by directing it to the Catechism."
   - "The first three questions refer to Article xxv., the next to Article xxvii., the next to Article xxviii."

4. [LEXICON] There are instances of inappropriate word choice:
   - "The twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such change in the Supper of the Lord."
   - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith."
   - "It is my conviction that this looseness in the use of the word ‘Sacrament’ had led to great confusion."

5. [PHRASING] Some phrasing is awkward or overly complex:
   - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith."
   - "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question."
   - "The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the meant whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith."

6. [PUNCTUATION] There are several punctuation issues:
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxx.—bearing more or less upon the subject..."
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxx.—bearing more or less upon the subject..."
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxx.—bearing more or less upon the subject..."
   - "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxx.—bearing more or less upon the subject..."

7. [TENSE] There are numerous tense errors:
   - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue..."
   - "we was taught by our Lord Himself"
   - "He was present in the bread and in the wine"
   - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating"
   - "If it were not there it might have been possible to have argued..."
   - "the curate shall instruct him that if he do truly repent himself..."
   - "The wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth..."
   - "If a man ... by just impediment do not receive the Sacrament..."
   - "If they are made one by the act of consecration, neither one nor the other can be received alone."

8. [STYLE] The writing style is formal and academic, which is appropriate for the subject matter, but the numerous errors in grammar, syntax, and word choice make it difficult to read smoothly.

Based on my analysis, I'll now assign scores for both Coherence and Fluency:

**Coherence Score:**
The text is well-structured, with a clear logical progression and strong connections between its parts. The author maintains a clear focus and presents their argument persuasively. While there is some repetition for emphasis, the overall structure is sound and the argument is coherent. I would rate this as a 4 on the scale.

**Fluency Score:**
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward syntax, and word choice issues. The tense is often inconsistent, and there are several spelling and punctuation errors. These issues make the text difficult to read smoothly and hinder the flow of the argument. While the content is complex and the style is formal, the numerous errors significantly impact readability. I would rate this as a 2 on the scale.
