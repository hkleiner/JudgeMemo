Let me analyze the story to identify issues with coherence and fluency:

For Coherence (how well the story flows and is structured):
- The story is a long, detailed biography of Will Bradley, an American typographer and designer.
- It's divided into chapters that follow a chronological progression, which is good for coherence.
- However, the story jumps between different time periods and contexts without clear transitions.
- Some sections seem disconnected from the main narrative (like the detailed descriptions of printing techniques).
- There are some abrupt shifts in perspective and tense.
- Some historical context is provided, but it's not always clearly connected to Bradley's personal story.

For Fluency (grammatical correctness and readability):
- There are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings.
- There are missing articles, prepositions, and other grammatical elements.
- Some sentences have incorrect verb tenses.
- There are spelling errors.
- The text often uses non-standard or incorrect word forms.
- Some punctuation is missing or incorrect.
- The text has a somewhat archaic or overly formal style that might make it less fluent for modern readers.

Let me now identify specific issues:

[COHERENCE]
- The story jumps between different time periods without clear transitions.
- Some sections seem disconnected from the main narrative (e.g., detailed descriptions of printing techniques that don't clearly relate to Bradley's personal journey).
- There are abrupt shifts in perspective and tense.
- The historical context is sometimes provided without clear connection to Bradley's personal story.
- The narrative structure could be clearer in some sections.
- Some transitions between chapters are abrupt.

[LOGIC]
- Some cause-effect relationships are not clearly established.
- Some historical context is presented without explaining its relevance to Bradley's story.
- The narrative could be more clearly connected to show how different events shaped Bradley's career.

[STRUCTURE]
- The story is generally well-structured chronologically.
- However, some sections could benefit from clearer organization.
- Some paragraphs are too long and could be broken up for better readability.

[TRANSITION]
- There are some abrupt transitions between different topics and time periods.
- Some connections between paragraphs could be clearer.

[FLUENCY]
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors including missing articles, prepositions, and other grammatical elements.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward syntax or structure.
- [SPELLING] There are some spelling errors.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some punctuation is missing or incorrect.
- [WORD CHOICE] Some word choices are awkward or non-standard.
- [TENSE] There are some inconsistencies in verb tenses.
- [STYLE] The text has a somewhat archaic or overly formal style that might make it less fluent for modern readers.

Now I'll determine scores based on these observations:

For Coherence (1-5 scale):
- The story has a chronological structure but suffers from some coherence issues.
- The narrative generally progresses but has some abrupt transitions and disconnected sections.
- The story is somewhat coherent but could be improved with clearer transitions and better organization of some sections.

I would rate Coherence as a 3.

For Fluency (1-5 scale):
- The text has many grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistencies in tense.
- While it's generally readable, the numerous errors would significantly impact fluency.
- The text often reads awkwardly and would require significant editing to be fully fluent.

I would rate Fluency as a 2.

Let me now write the final answer according to the requested format:
