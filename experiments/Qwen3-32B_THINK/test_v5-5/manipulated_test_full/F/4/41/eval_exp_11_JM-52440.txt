Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to evaluate the given story for coherence and fluency according to the provided criteria.

Starting with fluency. The story is quite long, so I'll need to scan for any obvious issues like spelling mistakes, grammar errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation problems. I'll also check for repetition or syntactic structures that might hinder the flow.

Looking at the first few paragraphs, I notice some spelling errors:
- "Taughtvby" should be "Taught by"
- "ans place" should be "and place"
- "vlindly" should be "blindly"
- "remiaib" should be "remain"
- "heir" should be "her"
- "iur" should be "our"
- "Docteine" should be "Doctrine"
- "wind" should be "wine"
- "thr" should be "the"
- "bux" should be "but"
- "pressnt" should be "present"
- "eneeavouring" should be "endeavouring"
- "csome" should be "some"
- "stare" should be "state"
- "ftom" should be "from"
- "pleqse" should be "please"
- "Gox" should be "God"

There are also some grammatical issues:
- "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, ans place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Churchâ€™s doctrine." The comma before "and they only" should be a semicolon or a period.
- "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with anybsuch representation of its teaching." "anybsuch" should be "any such."
- "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion." The semicolon here is correct, but the sentence is complex and could be clearer.

There's a lot of repetition of phrases like "the Church of England" and "the Lord's Supper," which is expected in a doctrinal discussion, but it might be considered repetitive in a narrative context. However, since this is an academic or theological text, some repetition is acceptable for emphasis.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the story. The story is a theological treatise discussing the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England. It's structured into chapters, with an introduction followed by sections on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each section is well-organized, with clear headings and logical progression.

However, there are some points where the flow could be improved:
- The story jumps between discussing the Church's teachings and broader theological implications without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the Articles, it moves to the Catechism, then the Communion Service, and finally the Homilies. Each section is well-structured, but the overall flow between these sections could be smoother.
- Some paragraphs are very long and dense, making it difficult to follow the argument. Breaking them into shorter paragraphs or using more subheadings could help.
- There are some abrupt shifts in tone, such as from a formal theological discussion to a personal reflection on the emotional impact of certain doctrines.
- The conclusion summarizes the arguments but could benefit from a clearer synthesis of the main points and a more direct conclusion.

Overall, the story is well-structured and logically presented, but there are some minor issues with fluency that could be improved, and a few places where the coherence could be enhanced with better transitions and paragraph organization.

Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple grammatical errors including incorrect verb forms, missing articles, and incorrect prepositions (e.g., "Taughtvby", "ans place", "vlindly", "remiaib", "heir", "iur", "Docteine", "wind", "thr", "bux", "pressnt", "eneeavouring", "csome", "stare", "ftom", "pleqse", "Gox").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward or overly complex sentence structures that hinder readability (e.g., long, dense paragraphs with multiple clauses).  
[SPELLING] - Frequent spelling errors (e.g., "Taughtvby", "vlindly", "remiaib", "Docteine", "bux").  
[CLARITY] - Some abrupt shifts in tone and transitions between sections (e.g., moving from formal theological discussion to personal reflection).  
[TRANSITION] - Lack of clear transitions between the discussion of the Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, and Homilies.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
