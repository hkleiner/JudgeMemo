Alright, let's start by analyzing the given story for coherence and fluency. 

First, I need to understand what coherence and fluency mean in this context. Coherence refers to how well the story is structured and how logically the ideas flow from one to another. A coherent story should have a clear progression, with ideas that are connected and not disjointed. Fluency, on the other hand, relates to how smoothly the language is used, including proper grammar, syntax, and word choice.

Looking at the story, it's about the discovery of the Garden of Eden in what the author claims is the Mississippi River region. The author provides detailed descriptions of the landscape and draws comparisons to biblical descriptions of Eden.

Let me check for coherence issues first:
1. [STRUCTURE] The story has a somewhat disjointed structure. It jumps between different points about the location, descriptions of the landscape, and comparisons to biblical texts without clear transitions between these sections.
2. [LOGIC] Some of the logical connections are weak. The author makes claims about the location of Eden without clearly establishing the logical progression from evidence to conclusion.
3. [CLARITY] The story lacks clarity in several places. For example, it's not always clear how the specific geographical features mentioned connect to the biblical description of Eden.
4. [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt. The author often shifts topics without clear signposting or linking phrases.
5. [CONSISTENCY] There are inconsistencies in the narrative. For example, the author mentions various geographical features and historical references that don't always cohere into a unified argument.

Now for fluency issues:
1. [SPELLING] There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "thr" instead of "the", "tje" instead of "the", "llace" instead of "place", "bgarden" instead of "the garden", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "howevwr" instead of "however", "ghree" instead of "three", etc.
2. [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues and missing articles or prepositions.
3. [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward syntax that makes them difficult to follow.
4. [LEXICON] The author sometimes uses words incorrectly or inappropriately for the context.
5. [PUNCTUATION] There are punctuation issues, including missing commas and periods, and incorrect use of dashes.

Based on these observations, I'll now assign scores for coherence and fluency:

For Coherence:
- The story has some logical progression but suffers from disjointed structure and weak transitions.
- The author's argument is not consistently developed throughout the text.
- While there is some attempt to connect the geographical features to the biblical description of Eden, these connections are not always clearly explained.
- The narrative lacks a clear organization that would help readers follow the author's reasoning.

Given these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 3 - it's coherent in general but has several obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text.

For Fluency:
- The text contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors.
- Many sentences are awkwardly constructed.
- The frequent spelling mistakes and grammatical errors make the text difficult to read smoothly.
- While the author is clearly trying to convey a complex argument, the language issues significantly hinder the reader's ability to understand the text.

Given these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2 - there are major grammatical errors, repetition, syntactic structures, and missing components, but some fluent segments.

Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Numerous spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "thr" instead of "the", "tje" instead of "the", "llace" instead of "place", "bgarden" instead of "the garden", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", "howevwr" instead of "however", "ghree" instead of "three", etc.)
- [GRAMMAR] Grammatical errors including subject-verb agreement issues and missing articles/prepositions
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures that make comprehension difficult
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with abrupt shifts between topics
- [LOGIC] Weak logical connections between the geographical features described and the biblical description of Eden
- [CLARITY] Lack of clarity in how specific features connect to the Eden narrative
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas without clear linking phrases
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent narrative with references to various geographical features and historical claims that don't cohere into a unified argument

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
