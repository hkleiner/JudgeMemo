I need to evaluate the given story according to the two criteria: Coherence and Fluency, each on a scale from 1 to 5.

First, let me understand what the evaluation criteria mean:

**Coherence** - How well the story unfolds as a whole, with logically sequenced ideas, smooth transitions, and a clear narrative structure.
**Fluency** - How well the text reads from start to finish, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Now, let me analyze the story:

The story is a scholarly analysis of Charles Dickens' novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It's written in a very formal, academic style with many references to literary critics and theories about the novel's plot and characters. The text is dense with information about the characters, their relationships, and various interpretations of what might have happened to Edwin Drood.

Let me look for issues that would affect Coherence:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with chapters and sections, but it's more of an analysis than a narrative. It reads more like a literary critique than a story.
2. [LOGIC] The logical flow is generally good within each section as it discusses different theories about the novel. However, the overall narrative of Dickens' novel is not clearly presented, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the original work.
3. [CLARITY] The text is dense and often uses complex language that may be difficult for some readers to follow. The analysis is detailed but sometimes lacks clear connections between ideas.
4. [COHERENCE] As a story, it's not particularly coherent because it's not a narrative in the traditional sense. It's more of an academic analysis of a novel.

Now for Fluency:

1. [GRAMMAR] The text generally follows correct grammatical structures, but there are instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure.
2. [SYNTAX] The syntax is complex and sometimes convoluted, with long sentences that can be difficult to follow.
3. [SPELLING] I don't see any obvious spelling errors in the text.
4. [LEXICON] The vocabulary is advanced and appropriate for the academic nature of the text.
5. [PHRASING] Some phrases are awkward or could be more concise. The text often uses archaic or formal language that can be difficult to parse.
6. [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is generally correct, though the long, complex sentences can make the punctuation challenging to follow.

After evaluating the text, I'll provide my assessment of the Coherence and Fluency scores.

For Coherence:
- The text is structured and follows a logical flow within each section.
- However, it's not a traditional narrative story but rather an academic analysis of a novel.
- The overall coherence as a story is limited because it's not a narrative in the traditional sense.

For Fluency:
- The text is generally grammatically correct.
- However, the complex syntax and formal language can make it difficult to read.
- The text has a very formal, academic style that may not be as fluent as more conversational prose.

Based on this evaluation, I would rate:
- Coherence: 3 (Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text)
- Fluency: 3 (Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text)

Let me review again to make sure I'm accurate in my assessment.

Looking at the text again, I see that it's written in a very formal, academic style with complex sentences and archaic language. The text is dense with information and references to literary critics and theories. The structure is clear with chapters and sections, but it's more of an analysis than a narrative. The language is generally correct but often difficult to follow due to its complexity.

I'll maintain my initial assessment:
- Coherence: 3 (Coherent in general, with some obvious abrupt shifts and unclarity that is not resolved in the text)
- Fluency: 3 (Fluent in general, with some obvious grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the text)

Actually, upon further review, I think my fluency assessment might be a bit too low. While the text is complex and uses formal language, I don't see many grammatical errors. The primary issue is the complexity of the language, not grammatical errors. So I would revise my fluency score to 4 (Only containing some minor non-fluent parts or grammatical errors that basically have no effect).

So my final scores are:
- Coherence: 3
- Fluency: 4

Let me now provide the list of issues I identified that led to these scores:

**Issues:**
[STRUCTURE] The text is structured more like an academic analysis than a narrative story.
[LOGIC] The logical flow is generally good within each section but the overall narrative of Dickens' novel is not clearly presented.
[CLARITY] The text is dense and uses complex language that may be difficult for some readers to follow.
[COHERENCE] As a story, it's not particularly coherent because it's more of an academic analysis of a novel.
[SYNTAX] The syntax is complex and sometimes convoluted, with long sentences that can be difficult to follow.
[PHRASING] Some phrases are awkward or could be more concise. The text often uses archaic or formal language that can be difficult to parse.
[LEXICON] The vocabulary is advanced and appropriate for the academic nature of the text, but may be challenging for some readers.

**Final Scores:**
FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
