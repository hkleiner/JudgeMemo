Alright, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The story is about the author's claim that a specific location in the United States is the Garden of Eden, based on biblical descriptions. It's quite detailed and includes a lot of geographical and historical references.

First, I'll look for issues related to fluency. Fluency involves grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll check for any obvious errors in these areas.

Looking at the text, there are several instances of spelling errors. For example, "antldiluvians" should be "antediluvians" (missing an 'e'). There are also repeated instances of "the stuff" which seems to be a placeholder or error. Words like "jageed" (should be "jagged") and "beau ideal" (should be "belle" or "beau" is correct, but "beau ideal" is a fixed phrase, but the capitalization might be off). There are also some missing or incorrect punctuation marks, like missing commas and periods.

In terms of syntax and sentence structure, some sentences are quite long and run-on, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth..." goes on for several lines without proper breaks. This can affect readability.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and how well ideas are connected. The story presents a lot of information about the location of the Garden of Eden, but it's not always clear how each piece of evidence supports the main claim. There are numerous references to rivers, geographical features, and historical accounts, but the connections between these elements aren't always smooth or logical. 

The narrative jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, the author discusses the location of the Garden of Eden, then suddenly moves to a description of a specific geographical feature, then to a historical anecdote about a settler, and so on. These transitions are abrupt and can confuse the reader.

There are also some logical inconsistencies. For instance, the author mentions that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific area, but later contradicts this by mentioning other locations or by not providing clear evidence to support the claims. The use of phrases like "the stuff" and other placeholders suggests that parts of the text might be incomplete or placeholders for information that wasn't properly inserted.

The author also uses a lot of technical terms and specific names without sufficient explanation, which can make the text difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the region or the subject matter. Additionally, the repetition of certain phrases and ideas (like the importance of the Mississippi River) without adding new information can make the text feel redundant.

In summary, the main issues with fluency include spelling errors, awkward phrasing, and run-on sentences. For coherence, the problems are related to logical flow, abrupt transitions, and lack of clear connections between ideas. These issues affect both the readability and the overall effectiveness of the story.

Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] Numerous spelling errors: "antldiluvians", "jageed", "euphonious", "mormon cooley", "beatiful", "trempealeau" (inconsistent capitalization), "stuffs", "mendora", "decoraâ€™s peak", "euphrates" (inconsistent capitalization), "euphony", "euphonious", "euphonious", "euphonious".  
[SYNTAX] Long, run-on sentences with poor structure and missing punctuation.  
[LEXICON] Inconsistent word usage: "stuff", "a thing", "the thing", "the stuff", "the thing" (used as placeholders or vague terms).  
[LOGIC] Logical inconsistencies in the argumentation. The text often jumps between topics without clear connections, making the central claim (Garden of Eden location) difficult to follow.  
[STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure with abrupt transitions between geographical descriptions, historical anecdotes, and theological arguments.  
[CLARITY] Unclear references and missing context: "the stuff", "a thing", "the thing", "the stuff" are used without explanation.  
[TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and sections. The narrative lacks a clear progression, making it hard to follow the author's reasoning.  
[REPETITION] Repetition of phrases and ideas (e.g., descriptions of the Mississippi River, "Garden of Eden" claims).
