Alright, let me go through this story and evaluate it based on the given criteria for Coherence and Fluency. I need to identify issues in each category and then assign the appropriate scores.

Starting with Coherence. The story is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, so I expect it to be well-structured. However, I'll check for logical flow, consistency, and how well the narrative progresses. The story follows a clear narrative arc, with each chapter building on the previous one. The characters and their interactions are consistent. However, I notice some inconsistencies in the text provided. For example, there are several instances where the phrase "the stuff" appears instead of specific names or places. This is likely a placeholder or a formatting error. These instances disrupt the coherence as they make the story confusing and hard to follow at times.

Looking at Fluency, I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and overall readability. The story is generally well-written, with proper sentence structure and vocabulary. However, there are instances of repetition and some awkward phrasing. The repeated use of "the stuff" also affects fluency as it breaks the flow of the narrative. Additionally, there are some minor punctuation issues and occasional awkward sentence structures that could be improved.

Now, let me list the specific issues under each category:

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC]: The repeated use of "the stuff" instead of specific names or places creates confusion and disrupts the logical flow of the story.
- [CLARITY]: The use of "the stuff" makes certain parts of the story unclear, as it's difficult to determine what is being referenced.
- [STRUCTURE]: While the overall structure is good, the repeated placeholders make it harder to follow the narrative.

Fluency Issues:
- [LEXICON]: The repeated use of "the stuff" is a placeholder and not a real word, which affects word choice and clarity.
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences have awkward phrasing that makes them a bit difficult to read smoothly.
- [SPELLING]: There are no obvious spelling errors, but the repeated "the stuff" is a placeholder that should be corrected.
- [GRAMMAR]: The grammar is generally correct, but the repeated "the stuff" disrupts the grammatical flow.

Based on these observations, I'll assign the scores. The story is mostly coherent and fluent, but the repeated use of "the stuff" is a significant issue that affects both categories. 

For Coherence, the story has some logical issues due to the placeholders, but the overall narrative is still understandable. I would rate it a 3, as it's coherent in general but has some obvious issues that disrupt the flow.

For Fluency, the story is mostly well-written, but the repeated "the stuff" and some awkward phrasing lower the score. I would rate it a 3 as well, as there are some grammatical and syntactic issues that hinder the flow.

Wait, let me double-check. The story is a classic, and the repeated "the stuff" is likely a formatting error or a placeholder for names that weren't properly filled in. This is a major issue that would significantly affect both coherence and fluency. However, if we consider the actual content and ignore the placeholder errors, the story is well-written. But since the user provided the text with these errors, I should rate based on the text as given.

Given the repeated "the stuff" errors, which are significant, I think Coherence is a 3 and Fluency is a 3. However, if the story were without these errors, it would likely score higher. But since the task is to evaluate the provided text, I must take the errors into account.

Issues:  
- [LOGIC]: Repeated use of "the stuff" instead of proper nouns (e.g., "Lord the stuff", "the stuff family", "the stuff road") creates logical inconsistencies and disrupts narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY]: Ambiguous references to "the stuff" make it difficult to understand specific characters, locations, or objects, reducing clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE]: While the overall plot structure is coherent, the repeated placeholders fragment the narrative and hinder smooth progression.  
- [LEXICON]: Use of "the stuff" as a placeholder instead of appropriate terms (e.g., names, places) affects word choice and readability.  
- [SYNTAX]: Some sentences have awkward phrasing or run-on constructions that disrupt smooth reading (e.g., "After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library").  
- [GRAMMAR]: Minor grammatical issues, such as missing articles or punctuation, are present but do not severely hinder understanding.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
