Okay, I need to evaluate the given story based on the criteria of Coherence and Fluency. Let me start by reading through the story to understand its content and structure. The story is a theological text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's structured into chapters and addresses various points like the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice.

First, I'll check for Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow, structure, and how well the ideas are connected. The text is quite long and dense, but the structure is clear with chapters and subheadings. Each chapter addresses a specific point, and the arguments are presented in a logical sequence. However, I notice some abrupt shifts in topics. For example, there's a sudden mention of "The opium hag, the Princess Puffer" and a passage about Millet's painting, which seems out of context. These parts might disrupt the flow and coherence of the main argument. Also, some paragraphs are very long and could benefit from better transitions between ideas.

Next, Fluency. Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, word choice, and overall readability. The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which might be intentional for a theological document. However, there are some grammatical issues. For example, "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" uses "IT" in all caps, which is inconsistent with the rest of the text. There are instances of missing commas, incorrect use of quotation marks, and some awkward phrasing. For example, "Now it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly clear a general definition..." has a run-on sentence that's hard to follow. Also, some sentences are overly complex, making them difficult to parse.

Now, let's list the issues with categories:

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in topic, like discussing a character from Dickens and a painting by Millet without clear connection to the main argument.
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs are long and lack clear transitions, making the logical flow less smooth.
- [CLARITY] Some parts are dense and could be more clearly explained, especially for readers unfamiliar with theological terms.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing").
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and complex structures that are hard to follow.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas and incorrect use of quotation marks.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal language that might be confusing for modern readers.

Now, assigning the scores. For Coherence, the text is generally coherent with a clear structure, but the abrupt shifts and dense paragraphs lower it a bit. I'll give a 3. For Fluency, there are several grammatical and syntactic issues that affect readability, so a 2 is appropriate.

Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., "The opium hag, the Princess Puffer" and Millet's painting) disrupt the logical flow of the theological argument.  
- [LOGIC] Paragraphs are overly dense with complex arguments, lacking clear transitions between ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some theological terms and historical references are under-explained, reducing accessibility.  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing") and run-on sentences.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Now it would be strange indeed if after having first given...").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas and inconsistent quotation mark usage.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or formal language may confuse modern readers (e.g., "IT" in all caps).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
