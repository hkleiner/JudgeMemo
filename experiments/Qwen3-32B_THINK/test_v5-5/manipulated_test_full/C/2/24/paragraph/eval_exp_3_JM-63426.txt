I'll carefully analyze the provided story and evaluate it for both coherence and fluency according to the given criteria.

First, let me read through the story to understand its content and structure:

This appears to be a biographical work about Will Bradley, an American graphic designer and typographer. The story is structured as a chapbook with multiple chapters detailing Bradley's life and career from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It covers his early life in Boston and Michigan, his career in printing and design, his work with various publications, and his contributions to American typography.

Now I'll evaluate the text for coherence and fluency:

**Coherence Issues:**
[STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured with clear chapters and a logical chronological progression of Bradley's life. The narrative flows from his childhood to his retirement.
[LOGIC] The logical connections between events in Bradley's life are clear and make sense.
[CLARITY] The text is generally clear, with well-defined events and transitions between them.
[TRANSITION] The transitions between different periods in Bradley's life are smooth, with the narrative progressing naturally from one stage to the next.
[CONSISTENCY] The narrative maintains consistent tone and perspective throughout most of the text.

**Fluency Issues:**
[GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical issues that affect fluency, though they are relatively minor:
- Some sentences have awkward phrasing or word choice.
- There are occasional punctuation issues.
- Some sentences are overly long and could be broken up for better readability.

[SYNTAX] A few sentences have complex syntax that makes them slightly difficult to follow, but these are not major issues.
[LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter and generally well-chosen.
[STYLE] The writing style is consistent throughout the text.
[FLOW] The text flows well for the most part, though there are a few places where the flow could be improved.

Looking for specific issues that would affect the scores:

I notice some unusual phrases and inconsistencies in the text, such as:
- Random technological references that seem out of place (e.g., "The 3D printer finished the replica", "The holographic map rotated slowly", "A GPS signal recalibrated", "A camera lens refocused itself", "A diagnostic tool scanned the network"). These appear to be anachronisms that don't fit with the historical context of the story.
- Some sentences have strange capitalization patterns that don't follow standard English conventions.
- There are some inconsistencies in tense usage throughout the text.
- There are a few places where the narrative shifts in perspective or voice without clear transition.

Let me now assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Coherence:
The story is well-structured with a clear progression through Bradley's life. The narrative is generally coherent, with logical connections between events. There are some minor issues with transitions and consistency, but these don't significantly impact the overall coherence.

For Fluency:
The text is mostly fluent with only a few grammatical issues and awkward phrasing. However, the presence of anachronistic technological references and some inconsistencies in capitalization and tense usage do affect the fluency.

After careful consideration, I would rate the story as follows:

Coherence Score: 4 - The story is mostly coherent with a clear narrative structure and logical progression, with only minor issues that don't significantly impact the overall coherence.

Fluency Score: 3 - The text is generally fluent but has some issues with grammar, punctuation, and anachronistic references that affect the flow and readability.

Now I'll finalize my evaluation:

Issues:
[COHERENCE] The narrative is well-structured with a clear chronological progression of Will Bradley's life and career.
[COHERENCE] The logical connections between events in Bradley's life are generally clear and make sense.
[COHERENCE] The text is generally clear, with well-defined events and transitions.
[COHERENCE] There are some minor inconsistencies in tense usage and perspective shifts.
[COHERENCE] The narrative maintains a consistent tone and perspective throughout most of the text.
[FLUENCY] The text is mostly fluent with only a few grammatical issues.
[FLUENCY] Some sentences have complex syntax that makes them slightly difficult to follow.
[FLUENCY] The vocabulary is appropriate for the subject matter and generally well-chosen.
[FLUENCY] There are a few places where the flow could be improved.
[FLUENCY] There are some anachronistic technological references that disrupt the historical context.
[FLUENCY] There are some inconsistencies in capitalization patterns.
[FLUENCY] There are a few instances of awkward phrasing that affect readability.
[FLUENCY] The punctuation is generally correct but could be more consistent in some places.
