Okay, I need to evaluate the given story for Coherence and Fluency using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. Let's start by understanding the criteria for each metric.

For **Coherence**, I need to check if the story unfolds logically, with ideas connected smoothly, no abrupt jumps, and a clear structure. The story is divided into two chapters: an introduction and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The introduction is a biographical essay about Will Bradley's influence on American graphic arts, while the second chapter is a narrative about his early life. I need to see if these two parts connect well and if each part maintains coherence internally.

For **Fluency**, I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I should check for any errors or awkward phrasing that might disrupt the flow of the text.

Looking at the story:

**Coherence:**
- The first chapter is an introduction that sets up Will Bradley's legacy and impact. It's a biographical essay with a logical flow, discussing his contributions to graphic arts, his style, and his influence.
- The second chapter is a narrative of his childhood and early career as a printer. It follows a chronological order, detailing his early life, work, and growth.
- The transition between the two chapters is abrupt. The first chapter is a reflective essay, and the second is a narrative. There's no clear transition or connection between them, which could confuse the reader.
- Within the second chapter, the narrative is coherent, with a clear progression of events in Bradley's life. However, some parts might be a bit dense with information, making it slightly hard to follow at times.

**Fluency:**
- The text is generally well-written with a formal tone. There are some complex sentences, but they are mostly clear.
- I notice a few instances where the punctuation might be off or where the sentence structure could be clearer. For example, in the first chapter, there's a sentence that seems to be cut off: "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window--where you can proudly wave to the schoolchildren as they are going home to their noon meal." The dash and the structure here could be confusing.
- There's a question mark in the middle of a sentence: "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." This might be an error.
- The text uses some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "devil" for an apprentice printer), which might be intentional but could be confusing to some readers.

Now, I need to list the issues under their respective categories and then assign scores.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the two chapters is abrupt, lacking a clear connection between the reflective essay and the narrative.
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the narrative in the second chapter might be dense with information, making it slightly hard to follow at times.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [PUNCTUATION] The sentence with the question mark in the middle of a statement: "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove."
- [STRUCTURE] The sentence structure in "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case..." is complex and could be clearer.
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic terms like "devil" might be confusing to some readers.

**Scores:**
- **Coherence:** The story is generally coherent with a logical flow within each chapter, but the transition between the two chapters is abrupt. The narrative in the second chapter is well-structured but could be slightly dense. I would give a score of 4, as there are some minor disconnected parts between the chapters.
- **Fluency:** The text is mostly fluent with some minor punctuation and structure issues. There are no major grammatical errors that hinder the flow. I would give a score of 4 as well.

Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the reflective introduction and the narrative chapter without clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] Dense information in the second chapter (e.g., detailed printing process) may overwhelm readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Unclear use of a question mark in "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove."  
- [STRUCTURE] Complex sentence structure in "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case..." disrupts flow.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic terms like "devil" (printer apprentice) may confuse modern readers.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
