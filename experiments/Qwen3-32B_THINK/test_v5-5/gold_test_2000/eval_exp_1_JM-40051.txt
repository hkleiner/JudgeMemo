Okay, let's start by reading the story carefully to understand what it's about. The author claims to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, specifically between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The narrative is quite detailed, describing the geography, the rivers, and the supposed similarities to the biblical description. The author also mentions the presence of rattlesnakes as a nod to the serpent in the Garden of Eden.

Now, I need to evaluate this story based on Coherence and Fluency. Let's break down each criterion.

First, Coherence. The story should have a logical flow, with ideas connected smoothly and a clear structure. The author starts by explaining their hesitation to publish, then moves into the biblical context, the discovery, and the geographical details. However, there are some issues here. For instance, the transition from the author's personal journey to the geographical description is abrupt. Also, the story jumps between different points without clear transitions. The section about the rattlesnakes and the "Serpent" is inserted in the middle of describing the scenery, which might disrupt the flow. Additionally, the author makes several assertions without providing sufficient evidence or connecting them logically, which might leave the reader confused about how the Mississippi River valley fits the biblical description. There are also some inconsistencies, like the mention of "antldiluvians" (probably a typo for "antediluvians") and the sudden shift to discussing the city of La Crosse at the end without tying it back to the main argument. These issues might affect the overall coherence.

Next, Fluency. This refers to the grammatical correctness, syntax, spelling, and smoothness of the text. Let me check for any errors. The story has several spelling mistakes, such as "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "admirirg" (admirable?), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist), "Jordon" (Jordan), "Bridtish" (British), "Havilah" (Havilah is correct in the biblical context, but the author might be misusing it), "consitutes" (constitutes), "hightest" (highest), "ampitheater" (amphitheater), "jageed" (jagged). There are also some grammatical errors, like "have a reasonable thing of it" (should be "have a reasonable understanding of it"), "have ventured to publish it" (maybe "I have ventured to publish it"), "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent..." (this sentence is a bit awkward and needs commas or restructuring). The sentence structure is often long and complex, which might make it hard to follow. There are also some awkward phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to..." and "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;'" which are unclear. The overall fluency is affected by these errors and awkward phrasing, though the main ideas are generally understandable.

Putting this all together, for Coherence, the story has a clear main idea but the flow is disrupted by abrupt transitions, lack of clear connections between ideas, and some inconsistencies. The score would likely be a 3 because while it's coherent in general, there are obvious issues that hinder the logical progression. For Fluency, the text has several spelling and grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some confusing sentences. However, the main content is still readable. This might result in a Fluency score of 3 as well, since there are obvious errors that affect the smooth reading but the text is still mostly understandable.

Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear structure; it jumps between the author's personal narrative, biblical analysis, and geographical descriptions without smooth transitions.
[LOGIC] Some assertions are made without logical connections to the main argument (e.g., sudden shift to discussing rattlesnakes as symbolic serpents).
[TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs disrupt the flow (e.g., moving from the "Hanging Garden" to La Crosse's description without context).
[GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors: "antldiluvians" (antediluvians), "admirirg" (admiring), "dimentions" (dimensions), "scientest" (scientist).
[SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures: "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent..." lacks clarity.
[SPILLING] Spelling errors: "Bridtish" (British), "Jordon" (Jordan), "jageed" (jagged).
[CLARITY] Unclear phrases: "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality;'" ambiguous references to biblical terms like "Havilah."

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
