Okay, let's start by reading through the provided story. It's a theological text discussing the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author is addressing the Real Presence and comparing it with Roman Catholic teachings.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency is about readability, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which might make it a bit dense. Let me check for any grammatical errors. I don't see any obvious mistakes in grammar. The sentences are long but structured correctly. However, the use of archaic language and complex sentences might affect readability for some readers. Also, there are some instances where the text could be more concise. For example, phrases like "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" are clear but could be phrased more simply.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well ideas are organized and connected. The text starts by introducing the topic and the controversy around the Real Presence. It then delves into the Church of England's teachings versus Rome's. The structure seems logical: introduction, then chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each section builds on the previous one. However, the transition between the introduction and the first chapter is abrupt. The author jumps from setting up the context to diving into theological details without a smooth transition. Also, some paragraphs are quite long and could benefit from being broken up to enhance clarity. The arguments are presented in a logical order, but the dense theological language might make it hard to follow for someone unfamiliar with the subject.

Looking at specific issues for fluency: The archaic style and long sentences might reduce fluency. The use of phrases like "I am not now discussing" could be simplified. For coherence, the lack of transitions between sections and the complexity of the content could be challenging. The author does a good job of outlining the points but could improve the flow between paragraphs.

Considering these points, I'd rate fluency a 3 because the text is grammatically correct but the style and sentence structure make it less smooth. Coherence is a 3 as well because the ideas are organized but the transitions and complexity hinder clarity for some readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues affecting fluency:**  
- **Archaic and overly formal language** (e.g., "I am not now discussing," "it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted") creates a barrier for modern readers.  
- **Long, complex sentences** with nested clauses (e.g., 300+ word sentences) disrupt readability and flow.  
- **Redundant phrasing** (e.g., "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced") slows down the narrative.  

**Issues affecting coherence:**  
- **Abrupt transitions** between sections (e.g., from introduction to doctrinal analysis without clear signposting).  
- **Lack of clear paragraph breaks** in dense theological arguments, making it hard to follow the logical flow.  
- **Over-reliance on abstract theological terminology** (e.g., "real objective presence," "communion of the blood") without sufficient explanation for clarity.  
- **Unclear connections between ideas** in some arguments (e.g., the distinction between "material" and "spiritual" food is introduced but not consistently tied back to the Church of Englandâ€™s doctrine).
