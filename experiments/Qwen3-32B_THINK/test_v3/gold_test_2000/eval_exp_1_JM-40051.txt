Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence:

Fluency:
Fluency refers to the readability and grammatical correctness of the text. I'll look for issues with sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

Issues with fluency:
1. There are numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement problems and missing articles.
2. The text has awkward phrasing and word choice that makes reading difficult.
3. There are punctuation errors, including missing commas and periods.
4. Some sentences are run-on or have poor sentence structure.
5. There are misspellings like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", and "Bridtish" instead of "British".
6. The text has inconsistent capitalization, with some words unnecessarily capitalized.
7. The author uses archaic or overly formal language that is not always appropriate to the context.

Coherence:
Coherence refers to the logical organization and flow of ideas in the text. I'll look for how well the ideas connect and build upon each other.

Issues with coherence:
1. The text jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's logic.
2. The author presents a theory about the Garden of Eden being in a specific location in America, but provides weak evidence and logical connections.
3. The text contains many assumptions and assertions without supporting evidence.
4. The author mixes religious references with geographical descriptions in a confusing way.
5. The text is repetitive and circles back to the same points without progressing the argument.
6. The author frequently uses rhetorical questions and exclamations that disrupt the logical flow.
7. The text has an unclear structure, with paragraphs that don't clearly lead to one another.
8. The author makes sweeping claims about the Garden of Eden being in this specific location without adequately addressing counterarguments or alternative explanations.

After evaluating the text on these dimensions:

For fluency, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The text has significant grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and spelling mistakes that make it difficult to read and understand. The writing is often awkward and unpolished, with many errors that distract from the content.

For coherence, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The text lacks a clear logical structure and often jumps from one idea to another without clear connections. The author's argument is not well-organized, and the text contains many assumptions and assertions without supporting evidence. The flow of ideas is often confusing and disjointed.

Let me now list the issues clearly:

Fluency Issues:
- Numerous grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, missing articles)
- Awkward phrasing and word choice that makes reading difficult
- Punctuation errors (missing commas and periods)
- Run-on sentences and poor sentence structure
- Misspellings (antldiluvians, admirirg, dimentions, Bridtish)
- Inconsistent capitalization
- Use of archaic or overly formal language

Coherence Issues:
- Jumps between ideas without clear transitions
- Weak logical connections between ideas
- Assumptions and assertions without supporting evidence
- Confusing mix of religious references and geographical descriptions
- Repetitiveness without progressing the argument
- Use of rhetorical questions and exclamations that disrupt logical flow
- Unclear structure with disconnected paragraphs
- Sweeping claims without addressing counterarguments
- Lack of clear thesis or argument development
- Disjointed presentation of evidence

Now, I'll provide the final scores as requested.
