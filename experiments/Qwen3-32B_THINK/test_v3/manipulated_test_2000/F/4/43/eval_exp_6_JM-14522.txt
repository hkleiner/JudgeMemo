Alright, let's start by reading the story carefully. The user provided a text that appears to be an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost," a well-known short story by Oscar Wilde. The story is presented in two chapters, the first being a detailed introduction to the Otis family and their purchase of Canterville Chase, and the second chapter, labeled "nothing," which continues the narrative about the ghost's appearances.

Now, I'll evaluate the text on the two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

### Fluency
Fluency refers to the readability, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text reads smoothly without awkward phrasing or confusing structures.

**Issues in Fluency:**
1. There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in the text. For example, "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can" is a jumbled sentence with no clear meaning.
2. There are run-on sentences and incomplete sentences, such as "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed."
3. The text has some punctuation errors, like missing commas and semicolons where they are needed for clarity.
4. Some sentences are missing verbs or have incorrect word order, making them confusing.
5. There are instances of non-standard or incorrect English usage, such as "the former the was, Umney 's, in to Mrs., consented Mrs. herLady housekeeper whom, earnest request keep Canterville at Otis had position."

### Coherence
Coherence refers to how well the ideas are organized and connected. A coherent text has logical flow between sentences and paragraphs.

**Issues in Coherence:**
1. The story has a logical progression in its narrative, following the Otis family's experience with the ghost, so there is a reasonable level of coherence in the overall plot.
2. However, the confusing and incoherent sentences mentioned above disrupt the flow of the text and make it difficult to follow.
3. There is a jarring transition in the second chapter where it starts with "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred." This sentence is not properly formed and seems out of place.
4. The text sometimes jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, especially when the ghost appears and interacts with Mr. Otis.

Overall, the story has a clear narrative structure and a coherent plot when the text is readable, but the numerous grammatical and syntactical errors significantly impact both fluency and coherence.

### Ratings
Based on the analysis:

**Fluency Score:** 2/5 - The text has many grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentences that significantly impact readability.

**Coherence Score:** 3/5 - The overall plot is somewhat coherent when the text is readable, but the many errors and incoherent sentences disrupt the logical flow and make it difficult to follow the narrative consistently.
