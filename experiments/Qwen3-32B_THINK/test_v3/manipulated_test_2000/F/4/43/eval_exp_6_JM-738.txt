I'll evaluate the quality of this written story based on the dimensions of fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand what I'm reading:

This appears to be an academic or critical essay analyzing Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." It discusses Dickens's writing style, his focus on plot construction in his later works, and attempts to analyze the plot and characters of "Edwin Drood," which was left unfinished at Dickens's death. The text references other critics and theories about the novel's unresolved ending.

Now, let's assess fluency and coherence:

**Fluency (how clear and readable the text is):**

1. The text contains many grammatical errors and awkward phrasings:
   - "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutely 'essential.'"
   - "Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_."
   - "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful 'A. by a late,' deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)."
   - "As seemed read revealed the-appeared to fragment, half to clear opium, especially read, influence understand the become: dark one least re concealed the at Jasper-by suddenly babblings-one half andunder very of points and 's meaning."

2. There are many missing words, incorrect punctuation, and odd capitalization:
   - "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character. Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_."

3. The text appears to be missing some formatting elements, like italics or quotation marks that might help clarify meaning.

4. The flow of sentences is often disrupted by these errors, making reading difficult.

**Coherence (how well the ideas are organized and connected):**

1. The essay has a logical structure with an introduction, analysis of Dickens's work, and a section on the story itself with character descriptions.

2. The author does provide a clear thesis about Dickens's focus on plot construction in his later works and his approach to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."

3. However, the text is often difficult to follow due to the fluency issues mentioned above.

4. Some concepts are introduced without clear transitions:
   - The text jumps from discussing Dickens's general approach to writing to specific details about "Edwin Drood" without smooth transitions.

5. There are references to other critics and theories (like Mr. Proctor and Mr. Cuming Walters) that are mentioned but not clearly explained or connected to the overall argument.

6. Some parts of the text appear to be incomplete or missing:
   - The section on the characters and the opening of the tale seems to have some missing content or formatting.

7. The text references specific illustrations (Sir Luke Fildes's illustration) without clear context or explanation.

Now, I'll rate the text on both dimensions:

**Coherence Score:**
The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, analysis of the author's work, and a section on the story itself. The author presents a thesis about Dickens's focus on plot construction in his later works and provides some analysis of "Edwin Drood." However, the flow between sections is often disrupted by the fluency issues. The references to other critics and theories are mentioned but not well integrated into the overall argument. The character descriptions and analysis are present but sometimes difficult to follow due to the text's issues. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5 for coherence - the structure is logical but the execution is hampered by other issues.

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and formatting issues that make it difficult to read. There are many missing words, incorrect punctuation, and odd capitalization that disrupt the flow of reading. The text appears to be missing some content or formatting elements that would help clarify meaning. While the content itself is academic and complex, the presentation makes it challenging to understand. I would rate this as a 2 out of 5 for fluency - the content is there but the presentation is significantly hindered by these issues.

The low fluency score particularly affects the overall readability, which in turn impacts the coherence as well, since it's harder to follow the argument when the text is difficult to read.

Let me revise my scores based on a more careful reading:

Upon further review, I see that this text appears to be a scanned or OCR'd version of an older document, and many of the issues I've identified are likely OCR errors rather than errors in the original text. This changes my assessment somewhat:

**Fluency Score:**
Given that the issues are likely OCR errors rather than errors in the original text, I should not penalize the original author for these issues. The content itself appears to be well-written when we can understand it. I would rate the fluency as a 4 out of 5 - the text would be fluent if not for the OCR errors.

**Coherence Score:**
The structure of the essay is logical with a clear introduction, analysis of the author's work, and a section on the story itself. The author presents a clear thesis about Dickens's approach to plot construction in his later works. The essay has a good flow between sections and connects ideas well when we can understand the text. I would rate the coherence as a 4 out of 5 - the organization and logic of the argument are strong despite the OCR issues.

So my final assessment is:
- Coherence Score: 4
- Fluency Score: 4

The OCR errors have significantly impacted my ability to assess the text, but based on the content that is clear, the essay is well-structured and the ideas are well-organized.

**Issues with the text:**

**Fluency Issues:**
1. Numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the text.
2. Incomplete or missing words in several sentences, making meaning unclear.
3. Odd capitalization and punctuation that disrupts reading flow.
4. Run-on sentences and lack of clear sentence boundaries.
5. Missing or incomplete words in key passages, such as: "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful 'A. by a late,' deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)."
6. Some sentences have reversed word order or missing words that make them difficult to parse.
7. Inconsistent use of italics and quotation marks that should help clarify meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**
1. While the overall structure (introduction, analysis of Dickens's work, character descriptions) is logical, the text is often difficult to follow due to fluency issues.
2. Some concepts are introduced without clear transitions between paragraphs.
3. References to other critics and theories (e.g., Mr. Proctor and Mr. Cuming Walters) are mentioned but not well explained or integrated into the argument.
4. Some parts of the text appear to be incomplete or missing content.
5. The text references specific illustrations (Sir Luke Fildes's illustration) without clear context.
6. Some arguments jump between different ideas without clear connections.
7. The discussion of Dickens's character development and plot construction could be more clearly connected to the analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
