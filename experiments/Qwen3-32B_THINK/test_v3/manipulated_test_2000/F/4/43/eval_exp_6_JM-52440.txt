Alright, I'm going to evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully and noting any issues that affect these aspects.

### Fluency Issues

1. **Awkward phrasing and sentence structure**:
   - There are many sentences that are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow.
   - Some sentences appear to be missing words or have word order issues.

2. **Grammar issues**:
   - There are instances of incorrect grammar, such as missing articles or prepositions.
   - Some sentences have subject-verb agreement issues.

3. **Punctuation problems**:
   - The text has inconsistent or missing punctuation in places.
   - There are some run-on sentences that could benefit from proper punctuation.

4. **Redundancy**:
   - There are instances of repetition or redundancy in the text.

5. **Word choice issues**:
   - Some word choices seem awkward or inappropriate for the context.
   - There are some instances where words appear to be missing or misplaced.

6. **Formatting issues**:
   - The text has inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "the" is capitalized at the beginning of sentences but not consistently in other contexts).
   - The text appears to have some formatting issues with line breaks and paragraph spacing.

### Coherence Issues

1. **Logical flow**:
   - The text jumps between topics without clear transitions.
   - Some ideas are introduced without sufficient explanation or context.

2. **Organization**:
   - The structure of the text could be improved for better organization.
   - The arguments presented are not always clearly connected or developed.

3. **References and connections**:
   - Some references are unclear or lack sufficient explanation.
   - The connections between ideas are sometimes tenuous or missing.

4. **Consistency**:
   - The text sometimes contradicts itself or presents conflicting ideas without explanation.

5. **Development of ideas**:
   - Some ideas are introduced but not fully developed or explained.
   - The text sometimes makes assertions without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning.

6. **Clarity**:
   - Some concepts are not clearly explained, making them difficult to understand.
   - The text could benefit from more concrete examples or explanations.

7. **Repetition**:
   - Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily, which can disrupt the flow and coherence of the text.

### Detailed Analysis

Let me go through the text more specifically to identify the issues:

1. **Fluency Issues**:
   - "The the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual."
     - This sentence is incoherent and appears to be missing words or have word order issues.
   - "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality."
     - This sentence is long and complex, making it difficult to follow.
   - "When the body feeds materially on the one, the believerâ€™s heart feeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the one must not be confounded with the other."
     - This sentence is clear, but the overall paragraph it's in is difficult to follow due to the previous issues.

2. **Coherence Issues**:
   - The text discusses theological concepts but doesn't always clearly explain them or their relevance to the main argument.
   - The transition from discussing the Church of England's doctrine to discussing specific Articles and Catechism is abrupt and lacks sufficient explanation.
   - The arguments presented are sometimes repetitive and not clearly connected to the main thesis.

3. **Additional Issues**:
   - There are several instances of missing words or misplaced words that disrupt the flow and meaning.
   - The text appears to have some formatting issues, such as inconsistent capitalization and paragraph spacing.

### Final Assessment

After reviewing the text for fluency and coherence issues, I would rate it as follows:

- **Fluency**: The text has significant issues with grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. There are many awkward and incoherent sentences. I would rate this as a 2 out of 5.
  
- **Coherence**: The text has issues with logical flow, organization, and development of ideas. The arguments are not always clearly connected or developed, and there are some inconsistencies. I would rate this as a 2 out of 5.
