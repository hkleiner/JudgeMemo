Alright, I need to evaluate the story "Will Bradley: His Chap Book" on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through it carefully to understand the content and structure.

First, the story is divided into two chapters. The first chapter is an introduction discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts, referencing historical figures and movements. The second chapter is a biographical narrative of Bradley's early life, detailing his experiences in school, work, and family.

Now, moving to fluency. Fluency is about readability, grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. Let me check for any awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing parts.

In the first paragraph, the sentence structure is complex but seems okay. Phrases like "romped like a breeze through American graphic arts" are metaphorical but clear. However, there are some run-on sentences that might be hard to follow. For example, "In America, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference. It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The second sentence is a bit long and could be split for better readability.

Looking at the second chapter, there are some grammatical errors. For instance, "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." This sentence is incoherent and doesn't make sense. It seems like a typo or a missing word, which severely affects fluency. There are other parts where the grammar is off, like "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." The structure here is confusing and needs correction.

Punctuation issues: The text uses em dashes and parentheses in a somewhat inconsistent manner. For example, "the kind you place on a table and slap with the palm of your hand. In business offices it is used to stamp date lines. Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item." The use of em dashes here is jarring and could be better formatted.

Word choice and redundancy: Some phrases are repetitive or use unnecessary words. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." The repetition of "non-" might be intentional for emphasis, but it could be clearer. Also, "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." The metaphor is clear, but the sentence could be more concise.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow between ideas and how well they are connected. The story starts with an introduction to Bradley's impact and then shifts to his early life. The transition between the two chapters is abrupt. The first chapter discusses his influence on graphic arts, while the second is a personal narrative. There's a lack of transition that connects these two parts, which might confuse the reader.

In the second chapter, the narrative is a series of events in Bradley's life, but there are some disjointed sections. For example, the part about the printing press and the Ingersoll watch is confusing. The sentence "Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch." is followed by a paragraph about arithmetic, which seems unrelated. The flow between these events isn't smooth, and some cause-effect relationships are unclear.

There are also instances where the text jumps between different time periods without clear indicators. For example, the story moves from Bradley's childhood to his work as a printer without clear transitions. This can make it hard to follow the timeline of events.

Some parts of the text reference historical events or figures without providing necessary context. For example, "The George A. Newett and the newspaper that were later sued for libel by Theodore Roosevelt." The reader might not know the significance of this unless they have prior knowledge.

Additionally, the text includes some allusions to cultural or historical references that might not be clear to all readers. For example, "Kelmscott House" and "Universalists and Unitarians" are mentioned without explanation, which could affect the coherence for someone unfamiliar with these terms.

In terms of transitions between paragraphs and sections, the story uses em dashes and parentheses, which can be effective but are sometimes overused. This can create a fragmented reading experience.

Overall, the story has a good narrative structure but suffers from some fluency and coherence issues. The first chapter is more coherent and fluent, while the second chapter has more problems with grammar, punctuation, and logical flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Identified:**  

**Fluency Issues:**  
- **Grammar and syntax errors:** Multiple sentences are incoherent or grammatically incorrect (e.g., "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work").  
- **Run-on sentences and awkward phrasing:** Long, unbroken sentences hinder readability (e.g., "In America, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference. It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye").  
- **Inconsistent punctuation:** Overuse of em dashes and parentheses disrupts flow (e.g., "Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item").  
- **Redundant or unclear word choice:** Repetition of phrases and awkward metaphors (e.g., "non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design").  

**Coherence Issues:**  
- **Abrupt transitions between chapters:** The shift from the introduction to Bradley’s biography is jarring, lacking narrative connection.  
- **Disjointed narrative flow:** Events in the second chapter jump without clear transitions (e.g., sudden shifts from childhood to printing work without contextual links).  
- **Unclear cause-effect relationships:** Some actions or decisions are presented without logical explanation (e.g., Bradley’s sudden interest in becoming an artist after his father’s advice).  
- **Lack of contextualization:** Historical/cultural references (e.g., "Kelmscott House," "Universalists") are mentioned without explanation, alienating unfamiliar readers.  
- **Poorly structured paragraphs:** Ideas are presented in a fragmented manner, making it difficult to follow the timeline or thematic progression.
