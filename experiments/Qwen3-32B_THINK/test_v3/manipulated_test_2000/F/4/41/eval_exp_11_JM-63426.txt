Alright, I'll evaluate the quality of this written story on two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

First, I need to understand what these terms mean based on the definitions provided:

- Fluency: This relates to the overall clarity and readability of the text. It considers sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text reads smoothly from start to finish, without awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing structures. Sentences should be logically connected and easy to follow.

- Coherence: This evaluates how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. It considers the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, the clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other in a consistent and understandable way. Avoidance of abrupt shifts or unresolved references is key.

Now, I'll carefully read through the text and identify issues that affect these two dimensions.

Issues affecting fluency:
1. There are numerous spelling and typographical errors throughout the text (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "tomm" instead of "room", "wzit" instead of "wait", "c" instead of "and", etc.).
2. There are missing or incorrect punctuation marks (e.g., missing commas, periods, and quotation marks).
3. Some sentences have awkward phrasing or word choice that makes them difficult to understand.
4. Some words appear to be missing or incomplete (e.g., "toom" instead of "room", "freauently" instead of "frequently").
5. There are instances of missing words or incomplete sentences.

Issues affecting coherence:
1. The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions.
2. The story lacks a consistent narrative structure or clear progression.
3. Some paragraphs begin with a new idea without clearly connecting to the previous one.
4. There are instances where the reader is expected to understand context without sufficient background information.
5. The story sometimes shifts between different narrative voices (e.g., from a first-person perspective to an omniscient narrator).

Now, I'll rate the story on both dimensions:

Fluency Score:
The text has many spelling and typographical errors, awkward phrasing, and missing words, which significantly impact readability. However, the overall structure and meaning of most sentences can be understood despite these issues.

Coherence Score:
The story lacks a clear narrative structure and has abrupt shifts in perspective and topic. While there is some chronological progression in the life of Will Bradley, the narrative often jumps between different aspects of his life without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall story.

Based on these assessments, I would rate:

Fluency: 2/5 - The text has significant issues with spelling, grammar, and sentence construction that make it difficult to read smoothly.
Coherence: 2/5 - The narrative lacks a clear structure and has abrupt shifts in perspective and topic, making it hard to follow the overall story.

However, after reviewing the text again, I realize I may have been too harsh. Let me reconsider:

Fluency: 2/5 - The text has numerous spelling and typographical errors that make reading difficult. Many sentences have awkward phrasing or incomplete structures.
Coherence: 2/5 - The story lacks a consistent narrative structure and has abrupt shifts in perspective and topic. The reader often has to infer context or connections between ideas.

Let me check one more time for accuracy:

Fluency: 2/5 - The text has many spelling and typographical errors that significantly impact readability. Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or incomplete.
Coherence: 2/5 - The narrative lacks a clear structure and has abrupt shifts in perspective and topic. The reader often has to infer context or connections between ideas.

I believe these ratings accurately reflect the quality of the text based on the provided definitions.

- Awkward phrasing and word choice in several sentences
- Incomplete words and missing letters (e.g., "freauently" instead of "frequently", "c" instead of "and")
- Some sentences are missing words or are incomplete

Issues affecting coherence:
- Abrupt shifts in narrative perspective between first-person and third-person
- Disjointed structure with little clear progression or organization
- Missing transitions between paragraphs and ideas
- Unclear connections between different sections of the narrative
- Inconsistent timeline presentation
- Lack of clear narrative through-line connecting Will Bradley's life events
