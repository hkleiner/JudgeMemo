Alright, let's take a look at the given text and assess its fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Assessment:**

Fluency refers to how smoothly and clearly the text is written, including sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

Issues I notice with fluency in the text:

1. **Spelling errors**: There are several spelling mistakes throughout the text, such as "ajd" instead of "and", "absolutsly" instead of "absolutely", "apopldxy" instead of "apoplexy", "notvout" instead of "not out", "half-conceaoed" instead of "half-concealed", "cthe" instead of "the", "bthebsupernormal" instead of "the supernatural", "agrd" instead of "aged", "a-ysar" instead of "a year", "thickmblack" instead of "thick black", "ovwr" instead of "over", "nickjamed" instead of "nicknamed", "yexrs" instead of "years", "befkre" instead of "before", "fhat" instead of "that", "tjis" instead of "this", and many others.

2. **Punctuation issues**: There are instances of missing or incorrect punctuation. For example, "romam policier," should be "roman policier," and the text has inconsistent use of quotation marks and italics.

3. **Awkward phrasing**: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed. For example, "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises." The use of "ajd" instead of "and" is particularly jarring.

4. **Run-on sentences**: Some sentences are too long and could benefit from being broken up for clarity.

5. **Inconsistent formatting**: The text has inconsistent formatting, especially with italics and quotation marks for book and character names.

6. **Typos and missing words**: There are instances where words appear to be missing or misspelled, making the text harder to read.

**Coherence Assessment:**

Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected, including logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, clarity of transitions, and consistency of ideas.

Issues I notice with coherence in the text:

1. **Abrupt shifts**: There are some abrupt shifts in the narrative, particularly between the introduction and the actual story, which makes the text feel disjointed.

2. **Lack of clear transitions**: The text sometimes lacks clear transitions between ideas or paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.

3. **Inconsistent focus**: The text shifts between analyzing Dickens's writing style and providing a summary of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," which can make it hard to follow the author's main argument.

4. **Missing context**: The text assumes a level of familiarity with Dickens and his works that may not be appropriate for all readers, making it less accessible.

5. **Inconsistent structure**: The structure of the text is somewhat inconsistent, with the introduction being quite analytical while the story section is more narrative.

6. **Unexplained references**: There are references to other works and people (like Mr. R. A. Proctor and Mr. Cuming Walters) that are not fully explained, which can be confusing for readers unfamiliar with these references.

7. **Unclear connections between ideas**: Some connections between ideas are not clearly made, particularly in the analytical sections.

8. **Repetition**: There is some repetition of ideas without clear progression, which can make the text feel redundant.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations.

**Fluency Score:**
The text has significant spelling errors, punctuation issues, and awkward phrasing that would make it difficult to read smoothly. However, the content is generally clear despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2 out of 5 for fluency. The text is readable but has many errors that would distract a reader.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has some issues with organization and logical flow, particularly between the introduction and the story sections. The transitions between ideas are not always clear, and there are some abrupt shifts. However, the content is generally understandable, and the main points are conveyed. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5 for coherence. The text has a clear purpose and presents information in a logical order, but the execution is somewhat inconsistent.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**
- Abrupt shifts between analytical commentary and narrative summary, creating a disjointed reading experience.
- Missing or unclear transitions between paragraphs and sections, especially between the introduction and the story analysis.
- Inconsistent focus that alternates between evaluating Dickens's writing style and summarizing *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*.
- Unexplained references to secondary sources (e.g., "Mr. R. A. Proctor," "Mr. Cuming Walters") without sufficient context.
- Repetition of ideas without clear progression or resolution.
- Lack of clarity in connecting the author's theories to the text of *Edwin Drood*.

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**
- Numerous spelling errors (e.g., "ajd," "absolutsly," "apopldxy," "half-conceaoed").
- Punctuation inconsistencies and missing punctuation (e.g., missing commas, incorrect italics/quotations).
- Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences that disrupt readability.
- Typos and missing words (e.g., "cthe," "bthebsupernormal," "notvout").
- Inconsistent formatting (e.g., irregular use of italics for book/character names).
- Jarring shifts in tone and register (e.g., academic analysis vs. narrative summary).
