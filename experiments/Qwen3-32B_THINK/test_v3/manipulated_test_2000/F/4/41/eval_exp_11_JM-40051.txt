Alright, let's start by reading through the story to understand its content and structure. The story is about a person claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States, particularly near Trempealeau on the Mississippi River. The author uses biblical references and geographical descriptions to support this claim. 

Now, I need to assess the quality of the text based on two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

**Fluency** refers to the clarity, readability, and correctness of the text. I'll look for issues like grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. A fluent text should read smoothly without awkward phrasing or confusing structures.

**Coherence** refers to how well the ideas are organized and connected. I'll evaluate the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, the clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other in a consistent and understandable way.

Let's break down the issues in the text:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. **Spelling errors and typos**: There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "princopak" instead of "principal," "locayion" instead of "location," "thr" instead of "the," "thr" instead of "the," "prlper dimentions" instead of "proper dimensions," "investigatikn" instead of "investigation," "ingenuoty" instead of "ingenuity," "ignotance" instead of "ignorance," "eere" instead of "were," "but not knowing their day" which seems like a phrase that doesn't make sense, "confained" instead of "containing," "scwttered" instead of "scattered," "jt" instead of "it," "beyondndescription" instead of "beyond description," "walled in" instead of "walled in," "endkess" instead of "endless," "wlmost" instead of "almost," "jageed" instead of "jagged," and "crossew" instead of "crosses."

2. **Awkward sentence structure**: Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The use of "He" and the comma placement is awkward.

3. **Redundancy and repetition**: There's a lot of repetition in the text, such as repeatedly emphasizing that this is the Garden of Eden and that the author is convinced of their discovery.

4. **Confusing word choice**: Some phrases are confusing or don't make logical sense, like "but not knowing their day" and "they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality."

5. **Missing or incorrect punctuation**: There are missing or incorrect punctuation marks throughout the text, such as missing commas, periods, and quotation marks.

6. **Inconsistent capitalization**: Some words are capitalized inappropriately or inconsistently, such as "Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" and "THE AUTHOR."

**Coherence Issues:**

1. **Lack of clear organization**: The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. It moves from the author's personal journey to biblical references to geographical descriptions without a clear structure.

2. **Confusing logical flow**: The argument that this location is the Garden of Eden is presented in a disjointed way. The author presents evidence, but it's not clearly connected or built upon in a logical sequence.

3. **Unclear connections between ideas**: The text often makes claims without clearly explaining the connections between them. For example, the author claims this is the Garden of Eden because of the rivers and topography, but the connections between these elements are not clearly explained.

4. **Abrupt shifts in perspective**: The text shifts between the author's perspective, biblical references, and geographical descriptions without smooth transitions.

5. **Unclear purpose and focus**: While the text is about discovering the Garden of Eden, it sometimes veers into descriptions of the local area and its development without clearly tying these back to the main claim.

6. **Unresolved references**: There are references to "the author" and "we" without clear antecedents, and some concepts are introduced without being fully explained.

Now, I'll rate the text on each dimension:

**Fluency Score**: Based on the numerous spelling errors, awkward sentence structure, and punctuation issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2 out of 5. The text is difficult to read and understand due to these issues.

**Coherence Score**: Given the lack of clear organization, confusing logical flow, and unclear connections between ideas, I would rate the coherence as a 2 out of 5. The text doesn't present a clear, logical argument for why this location is the Garden of Eden, and the ideas are not well-connected.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Identified:**  
- **Spelling/Typographical Errors**: Numerous misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians," "princopak," "locayion," "thr," "prlper dimentions," "investigatikn," "ignotance," "confained," "scwttered," "jageed," "crossew").  
- **Awkward Sentence Structure**: Overly long, convoluted sentences with poor punctuation (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere").  
- **Redundancy**: Repetition of claims about the Garden of Eden and the authorâ€™s certainty.  
- **Confusing Word Choice/Phrases**: Unintelligible phrases (e.g., "but not knowing their day," "they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality").  
- **Inconsistent Capitalization**: Random capitalization (e.g., "Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT," "THE AUTHOR").  
- **Logical Disorganization**: Lack of clear flow; shifts abruptly between biblical references, geography, and personal anecdotes without transitions.  
- **Unresolved References**: Unclear antecedents for pronouns ("we," "they") and abrupt shifts in perspective.  
- **Weak Argumentation**: Claims about the Garden of Eden are presented disjointedly, with minimal logical connections or evidence.
