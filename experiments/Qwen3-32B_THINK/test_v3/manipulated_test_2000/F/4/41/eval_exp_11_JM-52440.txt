Okay, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The text is a theological discussion about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author is arguing against the idea that the Church teaches the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, emphasizing instead the Reformation principles of spiritual feeding through faith.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. I notice some typos and spelling errors, like "unvommon" instead of "uncommon," "confidenve" instead of "confidence," and "doctrime" instead of "doctrine." These errors disrupt the flow and make the text less readable. Also, there are some awkward phrases and run-on sentences. For example, "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." The sentence structure here is a bit clunky and could be more concise. Additionally, some sentences are too long, making it hard to follow the argument without losing track. For instance, the paragraph starting with "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject..." is quite lengthy and could benefit from being broken into smaller sentences for better readability.

Next, coherence. Coherence refers to how well the ideas are organized and connected. The text does present a clear argument, but there are some issues with transitions between paragraphs and ideas. The author jumps from discussing the Real Presence to Adoration and Sacrifice, but the connection isn't always explicit. Also, the flow of ideas in some sections is abrupt. For example, after discussing the Articles of the Church, the author moves to a comparison with the Roman Catholic view without a smooth transition. Additionally, some terms are introduced without clear definitions, which might confuse the reader. For instance, "real objective presence" is mentioned but not fully explained in context. The text also uses complex theological terminology that might not be accessible to all readers, which could affect coherence if the explanations are not clear enough.

Looking at the structure, the introduction sets up the problem, and each chapter addresses a specific point (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice). However, the transitions between these sections could be smoother. The author sometimes introduces a new point without clearly signaling the shift, which can make the text feel disjointed. Also, some arguments are repeated or restated, which could be streamlined for better coherence.

In terms of grammar and punctuation, there are several errors that affect fluency. For example, "It is not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" should be "It is not now my discussion of..." to correct the subject-verb agreement. There are also instances where commas are missing, leading to run-on sentences. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." The semicolon here is appropriate, but the sentence is still quite long and could be split for clarity.

The use of dashes and em-dashes is inconsistent. For example, "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject..." The hyphen after "The Articles" is a bit confusing and might be better replaced with a colon or a different punctuation mark for clarity.

Overall, the text is dense with theological content and argumentation, which can be challenging for fluency and coherence. The author's intent is clear, but the execution has some issues that make the reading experience less smooth and the logical flow less immediate. The presence of errors and awkward phrasings detracts from fluency, while the lack of smooth transitions and some abrupt shifts in focus affect coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues affecting fluency:**  
- Numerous spelling errors (e.g., "unvommon," "confidenve," "doctrime," "realgroundn").  
- Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question").  
- Inconsistent punctuation (e.g., misuse of dashes, missing commas, fragmented sentence structures).  
- Repetition and redundancy (e.g., repeated emphasis on "real presence" without clear progression).  
- Overly complex and archaic sentence structures that hinder readability.  

**Issues affecting coherence:**  
- Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., shifting from Scripture to Church of England teachings without clear links).  
- Lack of explicit connections between theological concepts (e.g., unclear how "real objective presence" relates to earlier arguments).  
- Unresolved references (e.g., "the three heads of the RealnPresence, Adoration, and Sacrifice" is introduced but not elaborated).  
- Dense, jargon-heavy content with minimal explanation for non-specialist readers.  
- Inconsistent focus: shifts between critiquing Roman Catholic doctrine and defending Reformation principles without clear unifying thread.
