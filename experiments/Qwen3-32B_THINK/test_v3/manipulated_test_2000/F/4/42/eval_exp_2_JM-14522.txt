Alright, I'm going to evaluate the quality of the given written story on two dimensions: fluency and coherence, each on a scale from 1 to 5. Let me carefully read through the text and identify any issues.

First, I'll define the criteria:

**Fluency**: This refers to how smooth and readable the text is. I'll be looking at sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text should read smoothly without awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing structures.

**Coherence**: This evaluates how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. I'll be looking at logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other in a consistent and understandable way.

Now let's analyze the text:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. **Tense inconsistencies**: The text frequently switches between past and present tense without clear reason. For example, "every one tell him" should be "every one told him", "they come to discuss terms" should be "they came to discuss terms", "the ghost has am see" should be "the ghost has been seen".

2. **Subject-verb agreement errors**: "The ghost has am see" should be "the ghost has been seen", "the ghost has am see by several living members" should be "the ghost has been seen by several living members", "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses" should be "Gardenias and the peerage are his only weaknesses".

3. **Word choice errors**: "we'dded have it" should be "we'd have it", "we'ded have it" should be "we'd have it", "I reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it" should be "I reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it".

4. **Awkward phrasing**: "I had come from a modern country" should be "I have come from a modern country", "with all our spry young fellows painting the Old World red" is awkward and unclear, "I guess the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended" should be "I guess the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended".

5. **Missing words**: "I fear that the ghost exists," said Lord Canterville, smiling, "though it may had resisted" should be "though it may have resisted".

6. **Incorrect verb forms**: "I had always been of opinion that emigration was the only thing for England" should be "I had always been of the opinion that emigration was the only thing for England", "It must was removed at once" should be "It must be removed at once", "It must be the ghost" should be "It must be the ghost's doing".

7. **Awkward sentence structure**: "Washington Otis, who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by led the German at the Newport Casino" should be "Washington Otis, who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino".

8. **Missing articles**: "I had always been of opinion" should be "I had always been of the opinion".

9. **Incorrect prepositions**: "I must insist on your oiled those chains" should be "I must insist on your oiling those chains".

10. **Awkward phrasing in dialogue**: "I really must insist on your oiled those chains, and have bring you for that purpose a small bottle" is awkwardly phrased.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. **Time inconsistencies**: The text sometimes references past events in the present tense, which can be confusing. For example, "the blood-stain has been much admire by tourists" should be "the blood-stain has been much admired by tourists".

2. **Unnecessary repetition**: The text repeats the idea that the American family is dismissive of ghosts and supernatural occurrences, which becomes redundant.

3. **Inconsistent character portrayal**: The American characters are portrayed as being overly confident and dismissive of the supernatural, but their reactions to the ghost are inconsistent with this characterization.

4. **Missing transitions**: The text jumps abruptly from one scene to another without clear transitions, making the flow of the narrative less smooth.

5. **Inconsistent use of past tense**: The text often shifts between past tense and present tense without clear reason, which can make the timeline of events confusing.

6. **Unnecessary details**: The text includes many details that don't contribute to the main plot, such as the detailed description of Washington's dancing career.

7. **Inconsistent character names**: The text sometimes refers to characters by their full names and sometimes by their first names or titles, which can be confusing.

8. **Inconsistent use of past participle**: The text sometimes uses the past participle form incorrectly, such as "had been spilt" instead of "had been spilled".

9. **Inconsistent use of past perfect**: The text sometimes uses the past perfect tense incorrectly, such as "have fallen upon his knees" instead of "had fallen upon his knees".

10. **Inconsistent use of passive voice**: The text sometimes uses passive voice where active voice would be more appropriate, making the text less direct and clear.

Based on these issues, I'll now rate the text on fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Score**: The text has numerous grammatical errors, tense inconsistencies, and awkward phrasing that significantly impact readability. These issues would make the text difficult for a native English speaker to read smoothly. However, the overall story is understandable despite these issues. I would rate this as a 2 out of 5.

**Coherence Score**: The text has some issues with logical flow and organization. The time inconsistencies and abrupt scene changes make the narrative less coherent. However, the overall story has a clear narrative arc and the characters' actions are generally consistent with their characterization. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5.

Let me review my assessment one more time to ensure accuracy:

**Fluency**: The text has significant grammatical issues that would make it difficult to read smoothly. Tense inconsistencies, subject-verb agreement errors, and awkward phrasing are prevalent throughout. These issues would make the text challenging for a native English speaker to read. I'm confident in my 2 out of 5 rating for fluency.

**Coherence**: While the text has some issues with logical flow and organization, the overall narrative is generally coherent. The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the characters' actions are generally consistent with their characterization. The issues with time inconsistencies and scene transitions are noticeable but don't completely disrupt the overall coherence of the story. I'm confident in my 3 out of 5 rating for coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
- Tense inconsistencies throughout the text (e.g., "every one tell him" should be "every one told him", "they come to discuss terms" should be "they came to discuss terms").
- Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses" should be "are his only weaknesses").
- Word choice errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., "we'dded have it" should be "we'd have it", "I reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'dded have it" should be "we'd have it").

- Awkward sentence structure and missing articles (e.g., "Washington Otis, who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by led the German" should be "by leading the German", "I had always been of opinion" should be "I had always been of the opinion").
- Incorrect prepositions and awkward dialogue phrasing (e.g., "I must insist on your oiled those chains" should be "I must insist on your oiling those chains").

**Coherence Issues:**
- Time inconsistencies and shifts between past and present tense without clear transitions.
