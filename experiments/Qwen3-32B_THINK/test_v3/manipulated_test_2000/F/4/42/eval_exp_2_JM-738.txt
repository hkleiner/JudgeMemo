Alright, let me start by reading through the given text carefully to understand its content and structure. The story is an analysis of Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," discussing its plot, characters, and the author's intentions. It's written in a scholarly tone, referencing literary critics and theories.

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency relates to how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. I notice some awkward phrasing, like "He certainly write no longer" (should be "wrote") and "He was being watched by the hag, who hates him." There are also instances of inconsistent verb tenses and some run-on sentences. For example, "If she had been dealing in opium for ten years (the exact period is not stated), she had am very disreputable for twenty-six years..." The sentence structure here is confusing. Additionally, there are some missing articles and prepositions, such as "He was very dark, with thick black whiskers, and, for a number of years, has am a victim to the habit of opium smoking." The phrase "has am a victim" should be "has been a victim." These grammatical errors and awkward constructions hinder fluency.

Next, coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and organization of ideas. The text moves from discussing Dickens's writing style to specific characters and plot points in "Edwin Drood." However, there are some abrupt shifts in focus. For instance, after discussing the characters, the text jumps to the opening of the tale, then to specific scenes involving Sapsea and Durdles. The transitions between these sections are not always smooth. Also, some references are unclear, such as "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests..." without a prior mention of Mr. Walters. The text also references other works and authors without sufficient context, which might confuse the reader. The flow could be improved with better transitions and clearer explanations of how each section connects to the next.

Identifying specific issues:
- Grammatical errors and awkward phrasing
- Inconsistent verb tenses
- Missing articles and prepositions
- Run-on sentences and sentence fragments
- Abrupt transitions between sections
- Lack of context for some references
- Unclear explanations of character relationships and plot points

Now, considering these issues, I'll rate the fluency and coherence on a scale from 1 to 5. For fluency, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward constructions that make it less smooth to read, but the content is still understandable. I would rate it a 2. For coherence, the text has logical flow issues with abrupt transitions and unclear explanations, making it somewhat difficult to follow the argument. I would rate it a 3.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues affecting fluency:**  
- Frequent grammatical errors (e.g., "He certainly write no longer," "He was being watched by the hag, who hates him," "has am a victim to the habit").  
- Awkward phrasing and inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "He may be caricature too much," "we may thought that the mannerisms").  
- Missing articles/prepositions and run-on sentences (e.g., "If she had been dealing in opium... she had am very disreputable...").  
- Sentence fragments and unclear word choices (e.g., "He speak to his sister-in-law... he die in June, 1870, left three completed numbers...").  

**Issues affecting coherence:**  
- Abrupt shifts in focus (e.g., jumping from character analysis to plot summaries without clear transitions).  
- Unclear references to critics or theories (e.g., "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests..." without prior context).  
- Disjointed explanations of character relationships (e.g., Rosa’s motivations and Jasper’s obsession are mentioned but not fully connected).  
- Missing context for literary allusions (e.g., "Peveril," "The Signalman") that disrupt the flow for readers unfamiliar with Dickens’s works.  
- Repetition of ideas without progression (e.g., circular discussion of "atmosphere" and "secrets" without resolving their significance).
