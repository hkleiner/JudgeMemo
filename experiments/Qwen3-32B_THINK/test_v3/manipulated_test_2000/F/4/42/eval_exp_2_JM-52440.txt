Alright, I need to evaluate the quality of this text on two dimensions: fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The text is a theological treatise on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's written in a formal, somewhat archaic style. The first thing I notice is that the text is dense with theological terminology and complex arguments. That's to be expected given the subject matter, but it may impact fluency and coherence.

Let's break it down:

**Fluency:**
- The text uses many complex sentence structures and some archaic language ("IT is", "am", "was", "wased", "wase", etc.) which can be jarring to a modern reader.
- There are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies in verb tense and form. For example, "teach" should be "teaches", "am" should be "are", "was" should be "were", "wased" is incorrect.
- Punctuation is sometimes inconsistent or missing where it would help clarify meaning.
- The use of archaic or non-standard phrasing ("I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words...") makes the text harder to follow.
- Some phrases are awkward or convoluted, such as "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who made it, as if they, and they only, am the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine."

**Coherence:**
- The text presents a clear argument about the Church of England's doctrine on the Real Presence in the Eucharist.
- The organization is logical, with an introduction followed by a chapter on the Real Presence.
- However, the complex sentence structures and archaic language make the logical flow harder to follow at times.
- Some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, particularly in the theological arguments.
- The text sometimes jumps between different levels of abstraction without clear signposting.
- The author introduces several theological concepts (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) but doesn't always clearly explain their relationships or how they connect to the overall argument.

Let me rate these:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has many grammatical errors and uses archaic language that makes it difficult to read. The sentence structures are often complex and sometimes confusing. While the content is clear in intent, the execution of the language makes it less fluent. I would rate this as a 2 out of 5.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a clear structure and presents a coherent argument about the Church of England's doctrine. The organization is logical, and the author is consistent in their argument. However, the complex language and occasional abrupt transitions make the logical flow harder to follow. I would rate this as a 3 out of 5.

Let me review my assessment once more to ensure accuracy:

**Fluency Issues:**
- Grammatical errors in verb tense and form (e.g., "teach" instead of "teaches", "am" instead of "are", "was" instead of "were")
- Inconsistent use of archaic language (e.g., "IT is" instead of "It is", "am not" instead of "are not")
- Awkward phrasing and sentence structure
- Some missing or inconsistent punctuation
- Use of non-standard phrasing that makes the text harder to follow

**Coherence Issues:**
- While the overall argument is clear, the complex language and sentence structures make the logical flow harder to follow
- Some abrupt transitions between ideas
- The author sometimes jumps between different levels of abstraction without clear connections
- The theological concepts introduced are not always clearly explained in relation to each other

I believe my assessment is accurate. The text is attempting to make a coherent argument, but the poor fluency significantly hinders the reader's ability to fully grasp the content.

Let me now provide the final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
</think>

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**  
- Logical flow is occasionally disrupted by abrupt shifts between abstract theological concepts and specific arguments.  
- Relationships between key terms (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) are introduced but not clearly connected in the text.  
- Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are unclear or missing, making the argument harder to follow.  

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**  
- Frequent grammatical errors in verb tense and form (e.g., "teach" instead of "teaches," "am" instead of "are," "wased" instead of "ceased").  
- Inconsistent and archaic phrasing (e.g., "IT is," "am not," "was not").  
- Awkward sentence structures with excessive complexity, often lacking clear punctuation to aid readability.  
- Redundant or convoluted expressions (e.g., "the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who made it, as if they, and they only, am the true expositors of the Church’s doctrine").  
- Non-standard word choices (e.g., "wased," "wased to consisted," "wased to was confounded") that hinder comprehension.
