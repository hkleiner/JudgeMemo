Alright, let's start by reading the entire text carefully. The story is about someone claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States. It's written in a somewhat archaic style, which I need to take into account when evaluating fluency and coherence.

First, for fluency, I'll look at sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The sentences are often long and convoluted, with many run-ons and comma splices. For example, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I had a reasonable thing of it, had venture to published it." The verb tenses are inconsistent here. There's also a lot of awkward phrasing, like "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism." The capitalization of "CHAPTER" seems misplaced. There are also several misspellings and non-standard word forms, such as "antldiluvians" (should be "antediluvians"), "am opening" instead of "has opened," and "mighted was its proper dimentions." These issues make the text harder to read and reduce fluency.

Next, coherence. The text should present ideas in a logical, organized manner. However, the flow is disrupted by abrupt shifts in topic. For example, the author starts talking about the Garden of Eden in America, then discusses the rivers, then the location details, and then abruptly mentions the "hanging garden" and rattlesnakes. There's a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs. The argument is presented in a disjointed way, with some points repeated and others not well connected. For instance, the author mentions the Garden of Eden's location multiple times but doesn't build a cohesive narrative. The conclusion about Trempealeau as the Garden of Eden comes suddenly without sufficient buildup. The references to the Bible and geological features are mixed without clear links, making it hard to follow the reasoning.

In terms of grammar and punctuation, there are several errors. The text uses incorrect verb forms, like "had venture to published it" instead of "had ventured to publish it." There are also missing commas and incorrect use of semicolons or colons. For example, "the Euphrates river crossed that country, that “eastward”, or on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is locate the garden of Eden" has multiple issues with commas and verb tenses. The use of "was" and "were" is inconsistent, and some sentences are missing articles or prepositions, making the text confusing.

The word choice is problematic. The author uses archaic or non-standard terms, which, while perhaps intentional for a biblical tone, are sometimes unclear. For example, "antldiluvians" is misspelled and should be "antediluvians." The phrase "hung garden" instead of "hanging garden" is incorrect. There are also instances of incorrect prepositions, like "was locate the garden" instead of "was located." The text also contains some awkward phrasings that don't make sense in modern English, such as "the finger of time has am plainly pointing," which should be "the finger of time has plainly pointed."

In terms of coherence, the author's argument is not well-structured. The text jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions. For example, after discussing the location of the Garden of Eden, the author suddenly talks about the "hanging garden" and rattlesnakes without connecting it back to the main argument. The references to the Bible and the specific geographical features are not logically connected, making the overall argument hard to follow. The author also repeats some points, which could be due to the lack of a clear structure.

Another issue is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The author seems to present the idea that the Garden of Eden is in a specific location in America, but the argument is not developed in a way that clearly supports this claim. The text includes various pieces of evidence but doesn't effectively tie them together. For example, the mention of the four rivers and the geographical features are presented but not clearly linked to the Garden of Eden's biblical description. The conclusion is abrupt, with the author stating that the location is in Trempealeau without sufficient explanation of how this fits the biblical narrative.

The use of technical terms and biblical references is also inconsistent. The author uses terms like "Euphrates" and "Havilah" but doesn't explain their relevance in a way that connects to the argument. The geographical details are detailed but not contextualized within the broader argument. The text also includes some anachronistic references, like mentioning "electric towers" in a discussion of a biblical garden, which disrupts the coherence.

In summary, the fluency issues are due to poor grammar, punctuation, and word choice, making the text hard to read. The coherence problems stem from a lack of clear structure, abrupt topic shifts, and insufficient connections between ideas. The author's argument is presented in a disjointed manner, with many points not effectively supporting the main claim.

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**
- **Grammar and Syntax Errors:** Frequent incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "had venture to published it," "should was sought"), missing articles/prepositions, and run-on sentences (e.g., "But having become thoroughly satisfied... had venture to published it").
- **Word Choice and Spelling:** Non-standard or misspelled words (e.g., "antldiluvians," "mighted was," "dimentions"), inconsistent phrasing (e.g., "hung garden" instead of "hanging garden").
- **Awkward Constructions:** Overly long sentences with poor punctuation (e.g., "When God made man to dwelt... he simply stated the principal facts..."), and illogical phrasing (e.g., "the finger of time has am plainly pointing").
- **Capitalization Errors:** Misplaced capitalization (e.g., "Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT").

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**
- **Disjointed Structure:** Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from biblical analysis to geographical details to rattlesnakes), with no clear transitions.
- **Weak Logical Flow:** Ideas presented in isolation (e.g., "four rivers" and "hanging garden" discussed separately without connecting to the Garden of Eden thesis).
- **Repetition and Redundancy:** Repeated claims about the Garden of Eden’s location without building a cohesive argument.
- **Unclear Connections:** Biblical references and geographical features are mentioned but not logically tied to the central claim (e.g., "Euphrates" equated to "Mississippi" with insufficient justification).
- **Anachronisms:** Modern elements (e.g., "electric towers") juxtaposed with biblical themes, disrupting narrative consistency.
