Alright, let's start by reading through the entire text carefully. The story is divided into two chapters: an introduction about Will Bradley and his impact on American graphic arts, and a second chapter detailing his early life and career. 

First, I'll assess fluency. Fluency relates to the clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. I need to check for awkward phrasing, redundancy, confusing structures, and whether the sentences flow smoothly. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK. I agreed to write an introduction to Will Bradley, His Chap Book before I have seen the book’s text itself." The capitalization of "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK" is unusual and might be a formatting choice, but it could be jarring. The sentence structure here is a bit abrupt. Then, "Now I have encountered here the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man who romp like a breeze through American graphic arts for several decades--and I feel that my part should be little more than the opening of a door to this perennial springtime freshness." The phrase "romp like a breeze" is a bit awkward, and the sentence is quite long, which might affect readability. 

There are several grammatical errors. For example, "It shoulded be talked about" should be "It should be talked about." "It is hard to realized" should be "realize." "Barriers being demolish everywhere" should be "demolished." These errors disrupt fluency. 

In the second chapter, there are instances like "Most of the work is do by hand" instead of "done by hand," "you carried finished work back" instead of "carried," and "It is the kind you place on a table and slapped with the palm of your hand" instead of "slap." These are past tense issues that affect fluency. 

Another example is "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." "Pi" is likely a typo for "type" or "ink." Also, "When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font you file them to fit the type slot in the press." The sentence is a bit unclear and could be rephrased for clarity. 

Looking at the timeline and events, there are some inconsistencies. For example, "Your mother kept house for your cousins. Every night when you go to bed you kneel down and ask God to tell your uncle to bring you a printing press..." Then later, "Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch." This creates confusion about the timeline and the fulfillment of the request. 

The narrative shifts between present and past tense in a confusing manner. For instance, "You are the artist. Your mamma... is sitting on the platform." Then later, "You went to school for a few weeks." The tense shifts can be disorienting. 

There are also some unclear references. For example, "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings. Attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare." The description is a bit vague and could be more specific. 

In terms of coherence, the story should have a logical flow between sentences and paragraphs. The first chapter introduces Will Bradley and his impact, while the second chapter details his early life. However, the transition between the two chapters is abrupt. The first chapter ends with a reflection on Bradley's retirement and legacy, then the second chapter starts with his childhood, which is a significant jump. 

The second chapter is a detailed narrative of Bradley's early life, but it's written in a very dense and sometimes confusing manner. The events are presented in a linear fashion, but the lack of clear transitions and the frequent shifts in tense make it hard to follow. 

There are also some abrupt shifts in the narrative. For example, the story moves from Bradley's childhood to his job at the newspaper office, then to the environment of the print shop, and then to the incident with the faker. These transitions are not well-signaled, which can make the story feel disjointed. 

Additionally, the story contains some repetitive elements. For example, the mention of Bradley's work in various media (magazines, newspapers, advertising) is repeated in slightly different ways, which could be condensed for better coherence. 

The use of direct address to the reader ("You are six years old; next month you would be seven") is an unusual narrative choice and might be confusing for readers expecting a straightforward biography. 

Overall, the story has a wealth of information and a clear intent to highlight Bradley's contributions to American graphic arts. However, the execution in terms of fluency and coherence is marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and structural issues. The narrative could benefit from clearer transitions, consistent tense usage, and more precise language to enhance readability and maintain a logical flow.

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**
- **Grammatical Errors:** Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "It shoulded be talked about," "It is hard to realized," "Barriers being demolish everywhere").  
- **Awkward Phrasing:** Unnatural expressions (e.g., "romp like a breeze through American graphic arts," "He take off into a career").  
- **Inconsistent Tense Usage:** Shifts between past and present tense without clear transitions (e.g., "You are the artist... You went to school").  
- **Redundancy:** Repetition of ideas (e.g., repeated emphasis on Bradley’s impact on American design).  
- **Typos/Word Choice Errors:** "Pi" instead of "type" or "ink," "file them to fit the type slot" (unclear phrasing).  
- **Run-on Sentences:** Long, unbroken sentences that disrupt readability (e.g., 100+ word sentences with multiple clauses).  

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**  
- **Abrupt Transitions:** Sudden shifts between chapters (e.g., from Bradley’s legacy to his childhood) and within the narrative (e.g., from his early life to the Iron Ore incident).  
- **Unclear Narrative Flow:** Dense, disjointed events (e.g., jumping from childhood to job at the newspaper to the faker incident without clear connections).  
- **Confusing Timeline:** Ambiguous chronology (e.g., "Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch" after a prayer for a printing press).  
- **Overuse of Direct Address:** Confusing use of second-person narrative ("You are six years old...") that disrupts immersion.  
- **Missing Context:** Vague references (e.g., "attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare" lacks clarity).
