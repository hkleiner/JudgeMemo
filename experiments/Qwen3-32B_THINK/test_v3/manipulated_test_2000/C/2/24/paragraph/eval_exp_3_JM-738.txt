I'll carefully evaluate the given story for fluency and coherence, identify issues, and provide final scores.

First, let me read through the text carefully:

This appears to be an academic analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." The text contains:

1. An introduction discussing Dickens's writing style and construction of plots in his later works
2. Analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" 
3. Character descriptions 
4. Plot summary of the novel
5. References to various scholars and theories about the novel's mystery

Now, let me evaluate the text for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency Evaluation:**
Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, including sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

Issues with fluency I notice:
- Some sentences are very long and complex, which could reduce readability
- There are some awkward phrasings and word choices (e.g., "Youth will be served;")
- The text contains some outdated or archaic language that might be less accessible to modern readers
- There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and quotation marks
- The text includes some formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent italics usage for book titles)
- There are some run-on sentences that could benefit from being split into shorter sentences
- Some phrases are repetitive or redundant

However, the text is generally well-written with proper grammar and vocabulary for its academic tone.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected.

Issues with coherence I notice:
- The text jumps between different topics and perspectives at times
- There are some abrupt transitions between ideas
- Some references to characters and plot points appear without sufficient context
- The structure could be more clearly defined with headings or subheadings
- The text occasionally introduces new concepts without sufficient explanation
- Some of the analysis is quite dense and could benefit from more logical organization
- The text sometimes shifts between different levels of analysis (biographical, literary, critical) without clear transitions

However, the text does maintain a clear central focus on analyzing Dickens's novel and its mystery.

Let me now provide more specific issues in bullet points:

**Fluency Issues:**
- Some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better readability
- There are occasional awkward phrasings and word choices (e.g., "Youth will be served;")
- The text contains some outdated or archaic language that might be less accessible to modern readers
- There are some punctuation issues, particularly with the use of em dashes and quotation marks
- The text includes some formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent italics usage for book titles)
- Some run-on sentences could benefit from being split into shorter sentences
- Some phrases are repetitive or redundant
- There are some awkward transitions between sentences
- The text occasionally uses passive voice unnecessarily

**Coherence Issues:**
- The text jumps between different topics and perspectives at times
- There are some abrupt transitions between ideas
- Some references to characters and plot points appear without sufficient context
- The structure could be more clearly defined with additional headings or subheadings
- The text occasionally introduces new concepts without sufficient explanation
- Some of the analysis is quite dense and could benefit from more logical organization
- The text sometimes shifts between different levels of analysis (biographical, literary, critical) without clear transitions
- Some of the connections between ideas are not clearly stated
- The text could benefit from more explicit signposting of its argument and structure
- Some of the analysis is presented without sufficient contextualization

Now, I'll provide my final scores:

For **Fluency**, I would rate it as a 3.5. The text is generally well-written with proper grammar and vocabulary, but it contains some complex sentences, awkward phrasing, and outdated language that could reduce readability for some readers.

For **Coherence**, I would rate it as a 3. The text maintains a clear central focus on analyzing Dickens's novel, but it sometimes jumps between different topics and perspectives without clear transitions, and the structure could be more clearly defined.

However, I need to adjust these scores to fit within the 1-5 scale as requested in the instructions. Let me revise:

For **Fluency**, I'll round to a 4. The text is generally well-written with proper grammar and vocabulary, though it does have some complex sentences and outdated language that could reduce readability for some readers.

For **Coherence**, I'll rate it as a 3. The text maintains a clear central focus on analyzing Dickens's novel, but it sometimes jumps between different topics and perspectives without clear transitions, and the structure could be more clearly defined.

Actually, let me reconsider these scores more carefully:

The fluency is actually quite good for an academic text. While there are some complex sentences and outdated language, the text is generally clear and readable. I think a 4 is appropriate.

For coherence, I think a 3 is appropriate. The text does maintain a central focus, but it does have some issues with organization and transitions that could be improved.

So my final scores are:
- Fluency: 4
- Coherence: 3
