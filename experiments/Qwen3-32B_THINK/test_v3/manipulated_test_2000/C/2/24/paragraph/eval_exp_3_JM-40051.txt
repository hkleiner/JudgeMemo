Okay, let me start by reading through the story carefully to understand its content and structure. The story is about the author's claim to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific location in the United States. It's written in a somewhat archaic and enthusiastic tone, with a lot of references to the Bible and geographical descriptions.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency involves how smooth and readable the text is. I'll look for issues like grammar, sentence structure, punctuation, and word choice. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,' I have been very slow in making public the results of my discovery." The sentence is a bit long, but it's understandable. The phrase "first know you are right, then go ahead" is a bit awkward, but maybe it's a quote or a known saying. The use of "the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is confusing—maybe it's a typo for "The Galesville Independent" or a formatting error. The capitalization of "CHAPTER" is odd here.

Next, the sentence structure: "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The placement of "evidently" and the comma usage might be off. The sentence is a bit clunky but still readable. 

There's a lot of run-on sentences and missing commas. For example: "In giving the antldiluvians a description of the creation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them—and as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause of no little speculation." This is a long sentence with multiple clauses. It's hard to follow, and the commas don't always separate the clauses properly. The phrase "antldiluvians" is misspelled as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians."

The use of archaic language and phrases like "thus, the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause of no little speculation" is a bit stiff and might affect readability. However, it's not incorrect, just old-fashioned.

There are some awkward phrases: "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it." The sentence structure here is confusing. Also, "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place." The phrase "finger of time" is a metaphor that might not be standard, but it's not a grammatical error.

Looking at the paragraph starting with "Where would a scientest place the first pair..." The word "scientest" is misspelled; it should be "scientist." There's also a missing comma after "as he now is," which could be confusing.

The sentence: "From inherited wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right." The second sentence is a bit abrupt and doesn't clearly connect to the first. The use of "again right" is unclear.

In the paragraph about the Mississippi River: "It is located on the 'eastward bank' of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota." There's a missing comma after "Wisconsin," which is a standard comma splice issue.

There are several instances of run-on sentences and missing punctuation. For example: "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark,—densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes the islands and 'river bottoms'—cut up by water courses and sloughs." The em dash usage is inconsistent and might be confusing. The word "consitutes" is misspelled as "constitutes."

The paragraph about Trempealeau has some awkward phrasing: "Nineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the 'eastward bank,' nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site, Trempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless would have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original proprietors..." The sentence is very long and the structure is confusing. The phrase "nestles, and spreads out" is a bit awkward.

In the section about the "Hanging Garden," the author uses a lot of exclamation points and enthusiastic language, which might be stylistic but could affect fluency. For example: "Now, please, place yourself with me on the 'Central Outer Dome' 'Heald’s quarry,' facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below, and around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and importance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world." The sentence is a run-on with multiple clauses, and the punctuation is inconsistent.

The paragraph about the Mississippi River's course is long and has multiple clauses without proper punctuation. The use of "Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and surprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which you stand, and, look out for snakes..." has inconsistent punctuation and capitalization.

The final paragraph about the scenery is also a long run-on sentence with many clauses separated by commas. The use of em dashes and commas is inconsistent, and the sentence is hard to follow.

Overall, there are several issues with fluency: run-on sentences, missing punctuation, inconsistent use of em dashes and commas, misspellings, and awkward phrasing. The text is written in a very archaic and enthusiastic style, which might be intentional but does make it harder to read smoothly.

Now, for coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The story is about the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in a specific location. The main idea is to convince the reader that this place matches the biblical description. The author uses a lot of biblical references and geographical descriptions to support this claim.

The structure of the story is somewhat meandering. It starts with the author's hesitation to publish, then discusses the biblical account, the search for Eden, the author's discovery, and then a detailed description of the location. The flow is logical in that it follows the author's journey from hesitation to discovery to explanation. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after discussing the rivers and the Garden of Eden's location, the text suddenly jumps to a paragraph about the Mississippi River's course and then to the description of the hanging garden and snakes. The transition between these sections is not smooth.

The author also uses a lot of repetition to emphasize points, which might be intended to persuade the reader but can make the text feel redundant. For example, the repeated use of "Our garden is still in the right place" and "Our garden is again right" without clear progression.

The argumentation is based on the idea that the biblical description matches the geographical features of the area the author describes. However, the connections between the biblical text and the author's location are not always clearly explained. The author makes claims like "the Mississippi is the Euphrates" without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning, which might make the argument less coherent to the reader.

The text also includes some tangential information, such as the story of Mr. Dovile killing rattlesnakes, which, while relevant to the "serpent" in Eden, is presented in a way that disrupts the flow of the main argument. The mention of "voice-activated controls blinked to life" and "A mobile hotspot activated." seems out of place and might be errors or formatting issues, as they don't relate to the main content.

The conclusion is abrupt, ending with "fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most appropriately and providentially named. La Crosse—saying nothing of its being the name of an ancient game modernized—as here crosses the garden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline, may be seen coming in from..." The sentence is incomplete, which affects coherence.

Overall, the coherence is somewhat affected by the lack of clear transitions between sections, repetition of points without building on them, tangential information, and incomplete sentences. The author's enthusiasm and the archaic style might also make the argument harder to follow for some readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Identified:**  
- **Fluency Issues:**  
  - Frequent run-on sentences with missing commas or em dashes (e.g., long, unbroken clauses in the paragraph about Noah and antediluvians).  
  - Inconsistent punctuation (e.g., em dashes and commas used interchangeably without clear logic).  
  - Misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians," "consitutes," "jageed").  
  - Awkward phrasing and archaic/forced metaphors (e.g., "finger of time," "voice-activated controls blinked to life" [likely a formatting error]).  
  - Disjointed transitions between ideas (e.g., sudden shifts from biblical analysis to geographical descriptions).  

- **Coherence Issues:**  
  - Weak logical flow between sections; abrupt shifts from the author’s discovery to tangential anecdotes (
