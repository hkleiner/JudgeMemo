Alright, let's start by reading through the provided story carefully to understand its content and structure. The story is titled "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden" and seems to be an argument by the author for locating the biblical Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, specifically near La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona, Minnesota. The author draws parallels between the geographical features of this area and the descriptions in the Bible, particularly the presence of four rivers and the hanging garden.

Now, I'll assess the text for **fluency** and **coherence** based on the definitions provided.

### Fluency Assessment
Fluency refers to the readability, clarity, and grammatical correctness of the text. I'll look for issues with sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

1. **Sentence Construction and Grammar Issues**: The text contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is confusing and lacks clarity.
   
2. **Punctuation Problems**: There are frequent punctuation errors, such as missing commas and periods, and inconsistent capitalization. For instance, "the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" is unclear and grammatically incorrect.

3. **Word Choice and Redundancy**: The text has redundant phrases and unclear word choices, such as "the stuff" used repeatedly without explanation. This makes the text difficult to follow.

4. **Awkward Phrasing**: There are several instances of awkward phrasing, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place" which is grammatically incorrect and confusing.

5. **Spelling Errors**: There are spelling errors, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admiring."

6. **Tense Inconsistencies**: The text switches between past and present tense without clear transitions, which affects readability.

7. **Run-on Sentences and Fragments**: The text contains many run-on sentences and sentence fragments that disrupt the flow of the narrative.

8. **Unnecessary Repetition**: The author repeats the same ideas in slightly different ways without adding new information, which affects the fluency.

### Coherence Assessment
Coherence refers to the logical flow and organization of ideas within the text. I'll assess how well the ideas connect and build upon each other.

1. **Lack of Clear Structure**: The text lacks a clear structure or organization. The author jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the argument.

2. **Unconnected Paragraphs**: Many paragraphs seem disconnected from each other, with little or no logical progression. For example, the text moves from discussing the geographical features of the Mississippi River valley to discussing rattlesnakes and then to lumber mills without clear connections.

3. **Confusing Arguments**: The author's argument for locating the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley is presented in a confusing and disjointed manner, with little supporting evidence and many unsupported claims.

4. **Unclear References**: The text contains many unclear references, such as "the thing" and "the stuff," which are used repeatedly without explanation, making it difficult to understand the author's points.

5. **Lack of Supporting Evidence**: The author makes many assertions without providing sufficient evidence or logical support. For example, the claim that the Mississippi River corresponds to the Euphrates in the Bible is presented without any explanation or evidence.

6. **Unresolved References**: There are several unresolved references in the text, such as "Mr. Dovile" and "Healdâ€™s quarry," which are mentioned without sufficient context or explanation.

7. **Disjointed Transitions**: The transitions between ideas and paragraphs are often abrupt or missing, which disrupts the logical flow of the text.

8. **Lack of Focus**: The text lacks a clear focus or thesis. The author seems to be presenting a series of loosely connected ideas rather than a coherent argument.

Based on these observations, I will now rate the text on fluency and coherence.

### Fluency Score
Given the numerous grammatical errors, punctuation problems, awkward phrasing, and spelling errors, the fluency of the text is significantly impaired. The text is difficult to read and understand due to these issues. However, the content is somewhat coherent in terms of the author's argument, so I would rate the fluency as a 2 out of 5.

### Coherence Score
The text lacks a clear structure and logical flow, with many disconnected ideas and unclear references. The author's argument is presented in a confusing and disjointed manner, with little supporting evidence or logical connections between ideas. The frequent use of unclear terms like "the thing" and "the stuff" further disrupts the coherence. Therefore, I would rate the coherence as a 2 out of 5.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues affecting Coherence:**  
- Lack of clear structure and logical progression between ideas.  
- Disconnected paragraphs with abrupt shifts in focus (e.g., from geography to rattlesnakes to lumber mills).  
- Unresolved references and unclear terms like "the thing" and "the stuff" used repeatedly without explanation.  
- Unsupported claims and assertions presented without evidence or logical connections.  
- Missing transitions between ideas, making the argument disjointed.  

**Issues affecting Fluency:**  
- Grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions").  
- Awkward phrasing and sentence fragments (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place").  
- Inconsistent tense usage and run-on sentences.  
- Redundant and repetitive language without adding clarity.  
- Poor punctuation and capitalization (e.g., "the thing CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT").  
- Unclear word choices (e.g., "a stuff," "the thing") that disrupt readability.
