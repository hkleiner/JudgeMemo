Okay, let's start by reading through the story carefully. The title is "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England," and it's divided into an introduction and a chapter. The text is quite formal and theological, discussing the Church of England's stance on the Real Presence in the Eucharist.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. I'll look for awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing sentences.

Looking at the introduction, the first sentence is "IT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion..." The use of "IT" in all caps might be a typo or formatting issue. The sentence structure is a bit long but generally clear. There are some complex sentences, but they are mostly well-constructed. However, there are instances where the phrasing is a bit convoluted. For example, "the documents of the stuff are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt" – "the stuff" seems like a placeholder or typo for "the Church" or "the Church's teaching." That's confusing and affects fluency. 

In the main body, the text uses a lot of archaic language and theological terms, which might be expected for the subject matter, but it can make the text harder to follow for a modern reader. For example, phrases like "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" are clear, but the overall density of theological references might slow down the reading.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The introduction sets up the problem of confident assertions about the Church's doctrine, then the first chapter discusses the Real Presence. The structure seems logical, moving from introduction to the main topic. However, there are some abrupt shifts in focus. For example, after discussing the Church's documents, the text suddenly mentions "a thing" and "the thing" as points at issue, which seems like another placeholder or error. This disrupts the flow and makes it unclear what exactly the points are.

Another issue is the repetition of phrases and concepts. The text reiterates the distinction between material and spiritual food multiple times, which is coherent in reinforcing the argument but could be made more concise. Also, the use of "stuff" instead of "Church" or other terms is confusing and breaks the coherence by introducing unclear references.

There are also some missing transitions between paragraphs. For instance, after discussing the Articles of the Church, the text jumps to discussing baptism without a clear transition, which could leave the reader disoriented. The argument about sacraments in general and then specific to baptism is logical, but the connection could be smoother.

In terms of grammar and punctuation, there are a few issues. For example, "the documents of the stuff" and "loyal to a stuff" – "stuff" here is likely a mistake. There's also a sentence fragment: "the thing; and these three I propose to investigate in that order." The semicolon usage here is incorrect. These errors affect both fluency and coherence.

Overall, while the text is well-structured in its argument, the presence of placeholder words like "stuff" and "a thing" significantly hampers clarity. The complex sentences are mostly well-formed, but the repetition and lack of smooth transitions between sections affect the overall fluency and coherence. The theological content is dense but logically presented, though some parts could be more clearly explained.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues affecting coherence:**  
- **Unclear references and placeholder terms:** Repeated use of "the stuff" and "a thing/the thing" instead of specific terms (e.g., "the Church of England" or "the sacrament") disrupts logical flow and creates confusion.  
- **Abrupt shifts in focus:** Sudden transitions between topics (e.g., from discussing the Church’s documents to "three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing") lack clarity and coherence.  
- **Repetition and redundancy:** Overemphasis on distinctions between material/spiritual food and sacramental elements without advancing the argument.  
- **Missing transitions:** Jumps between sections (e.g., from general sacrament definitions to baptism specifics) lack smooth connections.  

**Issues affecting fluency:**  
- **Awkward phrasing and word choice:** Phrases like "the documents of the stuff" and "loyal to a stuff" are grammatically incorrect and confusing.  
- **Sentence structure issues:** Overly long sentences with complex clauses (e.g., "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence...") reduce readability.  
- **Typos/formatting errors:** "IT is a very easy thing" (capitalization error) and "a thing, and the thing; and these three..." (fragmented sentence structure).  
- **Archaic/verbose language:** Theological jargon and dense phrasing (e.g., "quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our faith") may obscure meaning for modern readers.
