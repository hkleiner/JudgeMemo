Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the story carefully. The story is about Will Bradley and his early life, divided into two chapters. The first is an introduction by someone else, and the second is about his childhood in Ishpeming. 

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how smooth and clear the text is. I notice some sentence structures that are a bit awkward. For example, phrases like "the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams" are a bit unclear. Also, there are some missing words or placeholders like "a thing" and "a stuff" which make the text confusing. The use of em dashes and some run-on sentences might disrupt the flow. There are also some grammatical issues, like missing commas or incorrect punctuation. For instance, "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget." The "which" here might be better as "that" for clarity.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and organization. The first chapter is a bit dense and jumps between different historical figures and events without clear transitions. The second chapter is a narrative of Bradley's early life but has some abrupt shifts in time and place. The use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders breaks the narrative flow. Also, some sentences don't clearly connect to the next, making it hard to follow the timeline of Bradley's life. The story mixes historical context with personal anecdotes without clear transitions, which might confuse the reader. The introduction's purpose is to set up Bradley's impact, but it's a bit jumbled with too much information without proper structure.

Issues affecting fluency: 
- Placeholder words like "a thing" and "a stuff" that make the text unclear.
- Awkward sentence structures and missing punctuation.
- Some grammatical errors and word choice issues.

Issues affecting coherence:
- Lack of clear transitions between ideas and time periods.
- Abrupt shifts in narrative without proper context.
- Overloading with historical references without connecting them smoothly.
- Use of placeholders disrupting the narrative flow.

Now, assigning scores. For fluency, the text has several issues with clarity and structure, but it's not completely unreadable. So maybe a 3. For coherence, the logical flow is problematic with many disconnected ideas, so perhaps a 2.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues affecting fluency:**  
- Frequent use of vague placeholders like "a thing" and "a stuff" instead of specific names or details.  
- Awkward sentence structures and missing punctuation (e.g., "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" lacks clarity).  
- Run-on sentences and abrupt shifts in time or context without clear transitions.  
- Grammatical inconsistencies, such as missing commas and unresolved references (e.g., "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove").  

**Issues affecting coherence:**  
- Disjointed narrative flow between historical context and personal anecdotes, lacking clear connections.  
- Overloading of historical references (e.g., Morris, Beardsley, Toulouse-Lautrec) without sufficient explanation or relevance to Bradley.  
- Confusing timeline transitions in the second chapter, with abrupt shifts between childhood events and minimal chronological clarity.  
- Placeholder text ("a thing," "a stuff") disrupts immersion and makes the story feel incomplete or unpolished.
