Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the given story's fluency and coherence. First, I need to understand what each of those terms mean based on the definitions provided.

Fluency is about clarity, readability, sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The text should flow smoothly without awkward phrasing or confusing parts. Coherence is about how well the ideas are organized and connected. The flow between sentences and paragraphs should make sense, with clear transitions and consistent ideas.

Looking at the story, the first thing I notice is that it's a mix of different chapters and sections. The first part is a dialogue between characters, then there's a chapter on the Church of England's doctrines, followed by a scene with a bloodstain and a family's reaction to a ghost, and then a section about George Stransom's feelings. These sections seem unrelated, which might affect coherence.

For fluency, I'll check for any grammatical errors or awkward sentences. The first part has a line: "He laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, ‘No, in talent and vigour.’" The word "ready" here might be a typo for "readily," but that's a minor issue. The rest of the first section is a chapter introduction, which is written in a formal tone. The next part about the Church of England is also formal, with complex sentences and theological terms. Then there's a shift to a more narrative style with the bloodstain and the Otis family, followed by another narrative about George Stransom. The shifts in tone and content might make the text feel disjointed.

In terms of coherence, the story jumps between different narratives without clear transitions. The introduction of characters like Jasper, Sapsea, and Durdles is followed by a theological discussion, then a ghost story, and then a personal story about George. These sections don't seem to connect, making the overall structure confusing. The lack of transitions between these different parts would lower the coherence score.

Looking for specific issues in fluency: The sentence structures in the theological part are long and complex, which might be hard to follow but are still grammatically correct. There are some instances of missing commas or awkward phrasing, but not many outright errors. The ghost story section has a more straightforward narrative but is cut off mid-sentence ("to Messrs."), which is a problem. The George Stransom section is more narrative but also lacks clear transitions to the previous parts.

For coherence issues: The main problem is the lack of connection between the different sections. The story starts with a character interaction, moves into a theological treatise, then a ghost story, and ends with a personal drama. There's no clear narrative thread or reason for these shifts. The abrupt transitions make it hard to follow the overall purpose of the text. Additionally, the ghost story is incomplete, ending mid-sentence, which disrupts the flow.

Putting it all together, the fluency is decent but has some issues with the ghost story's abrupt ending and a few awkward phrases. The coherence is lower because the text jumps between unrelated topics without transitions. The final scores would probably be a 3 for fluency and a 2 for coherence, but I need to check if there are other factors I might have missed.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**  
- **Disjointed structure:** The text abruptly shifts between unrelated narratives (theological discourse, ghost story, personal drama) without transitions or clear connections.  
- **Confusing organization:** The mix of formal theological analysis, character interactions, and fragmented narrative scenes creates a lack of logical flow.  
- **Unresolved references:** Characters (e.g., Jasper, Sapsea, Durdles) and plot elements (e.g., the bloodstain) are introduced but not resolved or connected to broader themes.  
- **Incomplete sections:** The ghost story ends mid-sentence ("to Messrs."), and the theological section lacks a clear narrative purpose.  

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**  
- **Awkward phrasing:** Some sentences are overly complex or verbose (e.g., "The practical conclusion is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine").  
- **Tone inconsistencies:** The text shifts between formal theological language and more casual narrative style without smooth transitions.  
- **Missing punctuation:** The abrupt ending of the ghost story ("to Messrs.") disrupts readability.  
- **Ambiguous references:** Phrases like "the Paragon Detergent" or "the family" lack context, making comprehension difficult.
