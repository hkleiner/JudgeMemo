Alright, let's take a look at this text. First, I'll read through it carefully to get a sense of what's going on.

The story starts with the author claiming to have found the Garden of Eden in the United States, specifically near the Mississippi River. There's a lot of biblical references and comparisons to rivers and locations. However, the text is a bit jumbled. The author goes from talking about the Garden of Eden to a completely different narrative about Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin. Then there's a sudden shift to a scene in a library with Mrs. Umney and the Otises. Later, there's another segment about an office with a glass partition and a Life Assurance Office. Finally, it ends with a story about George Stransom and Kate Creston.

So, right away, I notice that the text is a mix of different, unrelated stories. The first part is about the Garden of Eden in America, the second part is a Gothic-style story with a love triangle and a menacing uncle, then a scene from a house in England, followed by a business office, and ending with a tragic love story. These segments don't connect to each other. There's no clear transition between them, and they don't build on each other's ideas. This is a major issue for coherence.

Looking at fluency, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it." The phrase "a reasonable thing of it" is unclear. Also, "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large." The word "plat" might be a typo for "plot." There are also some missing commas and inconsistent punctuation. For instance, "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river..." The use of multiple dashes is confusing. Additionally, some sentences are run-on or lack proper structure, making them hard to follow.

Another issue is the mixing of different narrative styles and time periods. The author jumps from a historical/biblical context to a modern business setting, then to a Gothic horror story. This inconsistency in tone and setting further disrupts both fluency and coherence.

There are also some typographical errors, like "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," and "dimentions" instead of "dimensions." These errors affect readability and fluency.

In terms of coherence, the text fails to maintain a single narrative thread. Each segment introduces new characters and settings without connecting them to the previous parts. This makes the overall message confusing and disjointed. The author's main point about the Garden of Eden is overshadowed by these unrelated stories, which don't contribute to the central theme.

For fluency, the grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation make the text hard to read smoothly. The sentences often feel forced or incomplete, which disrupts the flow.

So, putting this all together, the coherence is poor because the text lacks a unified structure and transitions between unrelated stories. The fluency is also low due to numerous grammatical and stylistic issues. The author's intention is unclear, and the text reads more like a collection of unrelated fragments rather than a cohesive story.

FINAL Coherence Score: 1  
FINAL Fluency Score: 1  

**Issues affecting coherence and fluency:**  
- **Incoherent structure**: The text abruptly shifts between unrelated narratives (Garden of Eden, Gothic romance, Victorian house, insurance office, tragic love story) with no logical transitions or connections.  
- **Confusing narrative threads**: Multiple disjointed stories (e.g., Jasper/Rosa, Mrs. Umney, George Stransom) are introduced without context or resolution, creating a disjointed reading experience.  
- **Unclear purpose**: The central claim about locating Eden is overshadowed by unrelated anecdotes, making the text’s purpose and argument indistinct.  
- **Grammatical errors**: Frequent errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "consitutes") and awkward phrasing (e.g., "a reasonable thing of it," "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large") disrupt readability.  
- **Poor punctuation**: Overuse of em dashes (e.g., "——And from thence,——it was") and missing commas create confusion.  
- **Inconsistent tone and style**: Jumps between biblical exposition, Gothic horror, and modern business scenarios without cohesion.  
- **Typos and word choice**: Words like "plat" (likely "plot") and "Bridtish" (British) further degrade fluency.  
- **Unresolved references**: Sentences like "But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for themselves" lack clarity about what "it" refers to.
