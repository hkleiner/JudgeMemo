Alright, I'm going to evaluate the quality of the provided story text on two dimensions: fluency and coherence. Let me carefully read through the text first to understand what it's about and identify any issues.

The text appears to be an analysis of Charles Dickens's novel "Edwin Drood" by someone named Andrew Lang. It discusses the construction of Dickens's later novels, particularly focusing on the mystery and plot structure of "Edwin Drood." The text also includes a detailed summary of the characters and plot of the novel.

Now, I'll evaluate fluency first:

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, including sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text should read smoothly, with logical connections between sentences and easy-to-follow structures.

Issues with fluency in this text:
1. The text has an archaic or formal tone that might be challenging for modern readers, but this is more a stylistic choice than a fluency issue.
2. There are some complex sentence structures that might be difficult to follow, particularly in the introduction where it discusses Dickens's writing style and literary criticism.
3. The text uses many literary and historical references that require background knowledge to fully understand.
4. Some sentences are quite long and could be broken down for better readability.
5. There are some grammatical structures that are a bit unusual, such as the use of em-dashes and colons in ways that might confuse some readers.
6. The text occasionally jumps between different narrative modes (analysis of Dickens, summary of "Edwin Drood," and commentary on other critics), which can affect the smooth flow.

Now for coherence:

Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. A coherent text should have logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, with clear transitions and consistent development of ideas.

Issues with coherence in this text:
1. The text shifts between different modes of writing - literary analysis, character summary, and commentary on other critics' theories - without clear transitions.
2. The introduction discusses Dickens's writing style and literary criticism, then shifts to a detailed summary of "Edwin Drood," and then back to commentary on other critics, creating a somewhat disjointed structure.
3. Some paragraphs begin with new topics without adequate transition from the previous ones.
4. The text sometimes presents information in a non-linear or non-sequential manner, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas.
5. The text refers to other critics and theories without always clearly explaining their relationship to the main argument or analysis.

Now, I'll rate both dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best):

For fluency:
The text is generally well-written with clear grammar and punctuation. However, the complex sentence structures and shifts between different narrative modes can make it challenging to follow at times. The archaic language style might also be a barrier for some readers. I would rate this as a 3 on fluency - it's readable but has some issues with clarity and flow.

For coherence:
The text has some logical progression, especially in the summary of "Edwin Drood." However, the shifts between analysis, summary, and commentary on other critics are not always well-connected. The organization could be improved with clearer transitions between different sections. I would rate this as a 3 on coherence - the ideas are generally understandable but not always well-organized or logically connected.

Let me review my assessment once more to ensure I haven't missed any important points:

Fluency issues:
- Complex sentence structures
- Jumps between different narrative modes
- Some challenging vocabulary and archaic language
- Lack of paragraph transitions in some places
- Some grammatical structures that might be confusing

Coherence issues:
- Shifting between analysis, summary, and commentary
- Inconsistent organization of ideas
- Lack of clear transitions between sections
- Sometimes non-linear presentation of information

My final ratings remain at 3 for both fluency and coherence.

Wait, let me reconsider my fluency rating. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the text has many well-constructed sentences and the grammar is generally correct. The main issues are with the complexity and the shifts in narrative mode rather than with basic grammar or punctuation. Given that, I think the fluency rating should be slightly higher than 3. I'll revise my fluency rating to 4.

For coherence, I still believe the text has some organizational issues with the shifts between different modes of writing and the lack of clear transitions between sections. I'll maintain my 3 rating for coherence.

So my final assessment is:
Fluency: 4 (The text is generally well-written with clear grammar and punctuation, though some complex structures and shifts in narrative mode make it occasionally challenging to follow)
Coherence: 3 (The text has some logical progression but suffers from shifts between different modes of writing and inconsistent organization of ideas)

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

Issues affecting coherence:
- The text shifts between literary analysis, character summary, and commentary on other critics without clear transitions.
- The introduction discusses Dickens's writing style, then abruptly shifts to a detailed summary of "Edwin Drood," creating a disjointed structure.
- Some paragraphs begin with new topics without adequate connection to the previous content.
- The text presents information in a non-linear manner at times, making it difficult to follow the logical progression.
- There are abrupt shifts between different narrative modes (analysis, summary, and commentary) that disrupt the flow.
- The text refers to other critics and theories without always clearly explaining their relationship to the main argument.

Issues affecting fluency:
- The text contains some complex sentence structures that can be difficult to follow.
- There are occasional shifts in narrative mode that affect the smooth flow of the text.
- Some grammatical structures, such as the use of em-dashes and colons, could be clearer.
- The archaic language style might be challenging for modern readers.
- There are some long sentences that could be broken down for better readability.
- The text occasionally jumps between different narrative voices and modes without clear signal to the reader.

The text is generally well-written with clear grammar and punctuation, which is why I rated fluency higher than coherence. However, the coherence issues with organization and transitions significantly impact the overall readability and logical flow of the text.
