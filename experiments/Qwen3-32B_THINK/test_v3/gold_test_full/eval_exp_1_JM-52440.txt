Alright, let me tackle this. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of the given story. First, I need to understand what each term means. Fluency is about how smooth and readable the text is, considering grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. Coherence is about the logical flow and how well ideas are connected.

Looking at the story, it's a religious text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. The language is formal and archaic, with complex sentences and theological terms. 

For fluency, I notice that the sentences are long and sometimes run-on. There are a lot of semicolons and commas, which can make reading a bit clunky. Also, the use of archaic language like "wherewithal" or "wherewith" might be confusing to modern readers. However, the grammar is mostly correct, and the vocabulary is precise for the subject matter. There are instances of repetition, like the repeated emphasis on the Church of England's stance, which could affect fluency by making the text feel redundant.

For coherence, the structure is clear with chapters and subheadings, which help organize the content. Each section builds on the previous one, discussing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. However, the arguments are dense and repetitive, which might make the flow feel monotonous. The transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but the sheer volume of theological discussion and references to articles and homilies could overwhelm the reader. The author does a good job of connecting each point to the main argument, but the complexity might make it hard to follow for someone not familiar with the subject.

Issues affecting fluency: long sentences, archaic language, repetition, and some awkward phrasing. Issues affecting coherence: dense arguments, potential monotony from repetition, and complex structure that might be challenging for some readers.

Now, assigning scores. Fluency is a 3 because while the text is grammatically correct, the long sentences and archaic terms hinder smooth reading. Coherence is a 4 because the structure is logical and the arguments are connected, though the density and repetition might make it less coherent for some.

**Fluency Issues:**  
- **Long, complex sentences:** The text frequently uses lengthy, multi-clause sentences with semicolons and commas, making it challenging to follow.  
- **Archaic/obsolete language:** Phrases like "wherewithal," "wherewith," and "thou" create a barrier for modern readers.  
- **Repetition:** Ideas are often reiterated (e.g., the Church of Englandâ€™s rejection of transubstantiation), reducing readability.  
- **Awkward phrasing:** Some constructions (e.g., "It is hereby declared...") feel stiff and unnatural.  
- **Passive voice overuse:** Excessive use of passive constructions (e.g., "It is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted") slows the flow.  

**Coherence Issues:**  
- **Dense theological arguments:** The text assumes prior knowledge of Reformation theology, which may confuse uninitiated readers.  
- **Repetition of points:** While repetition reinforces the argument, it sometimes disrupts the logical flow.  
- **Over-reliance on citations:** Frequent references to Articles, Catechism, and Homilies create a fragmented structure.  
- **Complex structure:** The multi-layered discussion (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) is logically organized but becomes monotonous due to length and repetition.  
- **Ambiguous transitions:** Some shifts between paragraphs or chapters lack clear signposting (e.g., moving from the Catechism to the Communion Service).  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
