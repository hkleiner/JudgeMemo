Alright, let's evaluate the story's quality based on the criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, I'll read through the text carefully to understand the content and how it's presented.

This is a long, multi-chapter narrative about Will Bradley, a designer and typographer, written in a biographical style. The text is rich in historical detail about the printing industry and Bradley's career. It's written in a somewhat formal, descriptive style with some literary elements.

Now, let's assess fluency:

Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text. I'll look at sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

Issues with fluency I notice:
1. The text uses some archaic or old-fashioned language and sentence structures that might feel awkward to modern readers.
2. There are some complex sentences that are quite long and could benefit from clearer punctuation.
3. There are occasional instances where the flow of ideas is slightly abrupt or where transitions between sentences could be smoother.
4. Some phrases are repetitive or could be more concise.
5. The text includes some historical terms and references that might be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the printing industry of that era.

However, the text is generally well-written with proper grammar and punctuation. The vocabulary is appropriate to the subject matter, and the sentences, while sometimes long, are generally well-constructed.

Now, let's assess coherence:

Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. I'll look at the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, the clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other consistently.

Issues with coherence I notice:
1. The text jumps between different time periods and aspects of Bradley's life without always clear transitions.
2. Some paragraphs seem to start new topics without clear indication of how they relate to the previous content.
3. The narrative sometimes shifts between different perspectives (e.g., second-person "you" and third-person "he").
4. There are some sections that could benefit from clearer signposting or headings to help the reader follow the narrative.
5. The text occasionally shifts between different levels of detail without clear transitions.

However, the overall narrative has a clear chronological structure, and the content is logically organized to tell the story of Bradley's life and career.

Based on these observations, I'll now rate the text on both dimensions:

For fluency:
- The text is generally well-written with proper grammar and punctuation.
- The vocabulary is appropriate and well-chosen for the subject matter.
- There are some complex sentences that could be clearer.
- The archaic language might be slightly jarring to modern readers.
- Overall, the text is quite fluent, though not perfectly so.

I would rate fluency as 4 out of 5.

For coherence:
- The overall structure is logical and chronological.
- The narrative does have some abrupt shifts and transitions that could be clearer.
- The use of different narrative perspectives (you/he) sometimes causes confusion.
- The text could benefit from clearer signposting and transitions between sections.
- Despite these issues, the content is well-organized and the story is generally clear.

I would rate coherence as 4 out of 5.

Let me review my assessment again to ensure I haven't missed anything:

Fluency issues:
- Some complex sentences that could be clearer.
- Some archaic language.
- A few awkward transitions between ideas.
- Some repetition.

Coherence issues:
- Some abrupt shifts in narrative perspective.
- Some sections could benefit from clearer transitions.
- Some jumps in time periods without clear indication.
- Some paragraphs start new topics without clear connection to previous content.

I believe my ratings of 4 for both fluency and coherence are appropriate for this text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

Issues affecting fluency:
- Some complex sentences that could be clearer and more concise
- Occasional archaic language that might feel jarring to modern readers
- A few awkward transitions between ideas
- Some repetition of phrases and concepts
- Some historical terms and references might be confusing without context

Issues affecting coherence:
- Some abrupt shifts in narrative perspective (mix of second-person "you" and third-person "he")
- Some sections could benefit from clearer transitions between topics
- Some jumps in time periods without clear indication of chronology
- Some paragraphs start new topics without clear connection to previous content
- The multi-chapter structure could benefit from clearer signposting between sections
