Okay, I need to evaluate the story titled "Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden" based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding what each term means. 

**Fluency** is about how smooth and readable the text is. I should check for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word choice. If the sentences are awkward, have redundant parts, or confusing structures, that affects fluency. 

**Coherence** is about the logical flow and organization of ideas. I need to see if the ideas are connected well, if there are clear transitions between sentences and paragraphs, and if the overall structure makes sense. Sudden shifts or unresolved references would hurt coherence.

First, I'll read through the story to get a sense of it. The author is arguing that a specific region in the US (Mississippi River area) is the Garden of Eden based on biblical descriptions and geographical features. There's a lot of description of the landscape, rivers, and comparisons to biblical accounts. 

Now, let's check for **fluency issues**:

1. **Spelling and Typographical Errors**: There are several instances of misspelled words. For example, "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "stuffs" instead of specific place names, "euphony" instead of "euphonious," "jageed" instead of "jagged," "beatiful" instead of "beautiful," "conircling" instead of "incircling," "Heald’s quarry" with inconsistent formatting, "welkins" which might be a typo, "Heuston’s Bluff" with inconsistent capitalization, and many others. These errors disrupt the flow and make the text harder to read.

2. **Awkward Sentence Structure and Repetition**: The text has long, run-on sentences that are hard to follow. For example, "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere." The structure is awkward. Also, there's a lot of repetition, like "Come and see" repeated multiple times, and phrases like "we do not have... we do not have..." which are redundant.

3. **Inconsistent Capitalization and Punctuation**: The author inconsistently capitalizes place names and other terms (e.g., "Mississippi" vs. "Mississippi river"). There are also missing commas and periods, and some sentences are run-on. For instance, "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river, symbol of greatness and importance..." This sentence is incoherent due to missing punctuation and unclear structure.

4. **Inappropriate Word Choice and Usage**: Some words are used incorrectly or in a way that doesn't make sense. For example, "a scientest" instead of "a scientist," "a thing" used as a placeholder for place names or concepts without context, and "a stuff" which seems like a placeholder but is never clarified. This makes the text confusing.

5. **Tone and Style Inconsistencies**: The tone shifts abruptly between scholarly, poetic, and overly enthusiastic. For example, the text goes from a detailed geographical description to a poetic stanza about singing on a mountain, then back to a technical discussion of geological formations. This inconsistency in tone affects the overall fluency.

Now for **coherence issues**:

1. **Lack of Clear Organization and Transitions**: The text jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions. For example, the author starts by discussing the discovery of the Garden of Eden, then goes into a detailed description of the landscape, then shifts to discussing other theories and critics, and then back to the landscape. There's no clear structure or progression of ideas.

2. **Unresolved References and Ambiguity**: There are many instances where the author refers to things without clear antecedents. For example, "the stuff" is used multiple times as a placeholder for place names or concepts, but it's never clarified. Similarly, "a thing" is used without explanation, making it hard to understand the context.

3. **Confusing Comparisons and Analogies**: The author makes comparisons between the described landscape and biblical descriptions of Eden, but these comparisons are often unclear or overly verbose. For example, the author mentions that the region is "the very beau ideal of a garden" but doesn't clearly explain why this is the case, making the argument hard to follow.

4. **Redundant Information**: The text is repetitive, with the same points being made multiple times. For example, the author repeatedly states that the region is the Garden of Eden and that it's the only place that fits the biblical description. This redundancy doesn't add value and makes the text feel unfocused.

5. **Lack of Logical Flow**: The argument presented is not logically structured. The author presents various pieces of evidence (geographical features, geological samples, historical references) but doesn't clearly connect them to support the central claim. The flow of ideas is disjointed, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.

6. **Overuse of Exclamation Marks and Hyperbole**: The text uses excessive exclamation marks and hyperbolic language, which can make the argument seem less credible. For example, "Come and see! Come and see!!" repeated multiple times. This over-the-top tone can distract from the actual content.

7. **Inconsistent Use of Place Names and Descriptions**: The author refers to specific places and landmarks but often does so inconsistently or with incorrect capitalization. For example, "Trempealeau" is mentioned multiple times but sometimes with different capitalization or in different contexts without clear explanation.

8. **Unclear Purpose and Argument**: While the author's main point is to argue that a specific region is the Garden of Eden, the text meanders through various topics (geography, history, geology, agriculture) without a clear focus. The purpose is not always clear, and the argument is not effectively developed.

Considering all these issues, I need to rate the fluency and coherence on a scale from 1 to 5. For fluency, the numerous spelling errors, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent punctuation and capitalization would significantly impact readability. The text is hard to follow due to these issues. For coherence, the lack of clear organization, unresolved references, and disjointed flow make the argument difficult to follow and understand. The author's points are not effectively connected, and the text lacks a logical progression.

**Fluency Score**: 2 (The text has many errors and awkward phrasings that significantly disrupt readability. While the author's ideas are present, the frequent issues with grammar, spelling, and sentence structure make it hard to follow.)

**Coherence Score**: 2 (The text lacks a clear structure and logical flow. Ideas are presented without clear transitions, and there are many unresolved references and ambiguities that make the argument hard to follow. The author's central claim is not effectively supported or developed.)

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2  

**Issues Affecting Coherence**:  
- **Lack of Clear Organization**: The text jumps abruptly between topics (e.g., geography, criticism of other theories, agricultural data) without transitions or logical progression.  
- **Unresolved References**: Phrases like "a stuff," "the thing," and "stuffs" are used as placeholders for place names or concepts but are never clarified, creating confusion.  
- **Redundancy**: Repetition of claims (e.g., "Come and see!") and arguments (e.g., the region as the Garden of Eden) without development or new evidence.  
- **Confusing Comparisons**: Analogies between the landscape and biblical Eden are vague or overly verbose, lacking clear reasoning.  
- **Tone Inconsistencies**: Shifts from scholarly to poetic to hyperbolic (e.g., "Come and see!!") disrupt the flow and undermine credibility.  

**Issues Affecting Fluency**:  
- **Spelling and Typographical Errors**: Frequent misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians," "jageed," "beatiful") and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Mississippi" vs. "Mississippi river").  
- **Awkward Sentence Structure**: Run-on sentences and poor punctuation (e.g., "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was...") make reading laborious.  
- **Inappropriate Word Choice**: Misused terms (e.g., "scientest" instead of "scientist," "a thing" as a placeholder) and jargon without context.  
- **Tone and Style Inconsistencies**: Abrupt shifts in tone (e.g., from technical descriptions to poetic stanzas) create dissonance.  
- **Redundant Phrasing**: Overuse of repetitive expressions (e.g., "Come and see!") and circular arguments.
