Alright, let me take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate its fluency and coherence based on the given definitions.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, so I need to check for any issues with sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The sentences are generally well-structured, but I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, in the first paragraph, "the thing" is used repeatedly without clear antecedents. Words like "stuff" and "a thing" appear frequently, which is confusing. There are also some run-on sentences and missing articles or prepositions. The text seems to have some typos or placeholders, like "a stuff" or "the thing," which make it hard to follow. These issues would affect readability and fluency.

Now for coherence. The text's main topic is the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, comparing it with other beliefs. The structure is organized into chapters and sections, which is good. However, the flow between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt. The author shifts between discussing theological concepts and historical context without smooth transitions. The use of "the thing" and "stuff" without clear references creates confusion about what exactly is being discussed. There are also some logical gaps, like jumping from one point to another without sufficient explanation. The conclusion is clear, but the journey there is convoluted due to these coherence issues.

In summary, the text has some fluency issues due to awkward phrasing and unclear references, and coherence problems from abrupt shifts and logical gaps. I'll need to assign scores based on these observations.

**Fluency Issues:**  
- **Repetition and unclear antecedents:** Phrases like "the thing" and "a stuff" are used repeatedly without clear references, creating confusion about what is being discussed.  
- **Awkward phrasing and grammatical errors:** Sentences often lack clarity (e.g., "the thing" instead of specific terms), and some constructions are overly complex or incomplete.  
- **Typos/placeholder terms:** Words like "a stuff" and "the thing" appear to be placeholders or errors, disrupting readability.  
- **Run-on sentences:** Long, unbroken sentences (e.g., "The Reformers knew well enough what Rome meant by ‘transubstantiation,’ and the twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such change in the thing") reduce fluency.  

**Coherence Issues:**  
- **Logical gaps:** The text jumps between theological arguments and historical context without smooth transitions, making the flow disjointed.  
- **Ambiguous references:** Frequent use of "the thing" and "stuff" without clear definitions forces readers to infer meaning, weakening coherence.  
- **Overly dense arguments:** The author shifts abruptly between theological doctrines (e.g., Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) without sufficient signposting or summary.  
- **Inconsistent focus:** While the structure is organized into chapters, the argument occasionally digresses into tangential debates (e.g., adoration vs. sacrifice) without clear connections to the central thesis.  

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**
