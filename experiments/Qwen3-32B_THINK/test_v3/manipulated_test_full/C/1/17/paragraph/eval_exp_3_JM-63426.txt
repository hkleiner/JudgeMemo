Alright, let's start by carefully reading the story to understand its content and structure. The text is a biography of Will Bradley, an influential American graphic designer. It's divided into chapters that chronologically cover his life and career, from his early days as a printer in Michigan to his retirement in the 1950s. The narrative is written in a somewhat formal, almost literary style, with a mix of first-person and third-person perspectives. There are also some historical and artistic references, as well as a chronology at the end.

Now, I'll evaluate the text on the two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

**Fluency:**
Fluency refers to the readability, clarity, and smoothness of the text. I'll look for issues with sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice.

1. The text is generally well-written with a formal tone, but there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures. For example: "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on Baltimore Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear!" The use of em dashes and the exclamation mark feels somewhat jarring and inconsistent with the formal tone.

2. There are occasional run-on sentences that could be broken up for better readability. For example: "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors."

3. Some sentences have awkward or unusual word choices that might confuse readers. For example: "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." The phrase "corn-fed American" is used in a non-literal way here.

4. There are some grammatical issues, such as inconsistent verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. For example: "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." The use of "are" when describing a historical period might be confusing.

5. The text includes some historical and artistic references that may be obscure to modern readers, but these are more about content than fluency.

6. There are some stylistic inconsistencies, such as switching between first-person and third-person perspectives in different sections. For example, the introduction is written in the first person, while the main narrative is in the third person.

7. There are a few instances of redundant or repetitive language. For example: "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors."

8. Some sentences have unusual or archaic phrasing that might feel out of place in a modern context. For example: "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform, proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself."

9. The text includes some typographical inconsistencies, such as inconsistent use of em dashes and quotation marks.

**Coherence:**
Coherence refers to the logical flow and organization of ideas within the text.

1. The text is generally well-organized, following a chronological structure from Bradley's early life to his retirement. However, there are some abrupt transitions between sections.

2. Some paragraphs and sections feel disconnected from the main narrative, such as the extended discussion of Millet's painting skills in the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter, which seems out of place and unrelated to Bradley's story.

3. The text includes some digressions and tangents that don't directly relate to Bradley's life or career. For example, the section about the "verger" and the tomb of Prince Hedward seems out of place and unrelated to the main narrative.

4. There are some confusing references and allusions that are not clearly explained, such as the references to "The verger" and "Prince Hedward" at the end of the chronology section.

5. The text includes some historical and artistic references that are not clearly contextualized for a general audience, which might make the narrative feel disjointed or confusing to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.

6. Some sections are overly detailed and could be condensed for better flow. For example, the detailed description of printing presses and typesetting processes might be too technical for a general audience.

7. The narrative sometimes shifts between different perspectives and styles without clear transitions, which can make the text feel disjointed.

8. The text includes some repetition of information, which could be consolidated for better coherence.

9. The afterword and chronology at the end provide valuable context, but they feel somewhat disconnected from the main narrative.

Based on these observations, I'll rate the text on fluency and coherence.

For fluency, the text is generally well-written but has some issues with awkward phrasing, inconsistent verb tenses, and stylistic inconsistencies. I would rate it a 3 out of 5.

For coherence, the text is well-organized but has some disconnected sections, confusing references, and stylistic inconsistencies that affect the overall flow. I would rate it a 3 out of 5.

However, upon further reflection, I think these scores might be a bit low. The text is quite long and detailed, and while it has some issues, it's generally readable and organized. The historical and artistic content is substantial and well-researched. I would revise my scores to:

Fluency: 3.5 (rounded to 4)
Coherence: 3.5 (rounded to 4)

Actually, let me review again more carefully to see if these scores are accurate.

The text is well-written with a formal tone, but there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that could be improved. The narrative is generally well-organized and follows a logical progression, but there are some confusing references and stylistic inconsistencies that could be improved. Overall, I believe the scores should be:

Fluency: 4 out of 5
Coherence: 4 out of 5

The text is mostly well-written and organized, though it has some areas for improvement in both fluency and coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4  

**Issues affecting coherence:**  
- **Inconsistent narrative perspective:** The text alternates between first-person and third-person narration without clear transitions, creating a disjointed reading experience.  
- **Digressions and tangents:** Some sections (e.g., the detailed discussion of Millet’s painting skills) feel disconnected from Bradley’s biography and disrupt the narrative flow.  
- **Confusing references:** Unexplained allusions (e.g., the "verger" and "Prince Hedward" in the chronology) lack context for a general audience.  
- **Stylistic shifts:** The text abruptly shifts between literary descriptions and technical details (e.g., printing processes), which can confuse readers.  

**Issues affecting fluency:**  
- **Awkward phrasing:** Sentences like “He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too” use idioms in non-literal ways, creating ambiguity.  
- **Run-on sentences:** Lengthy, unbroken sentences (e.g., “It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern...”) hinder readability.  
- **Inconsistent verb tenses:** Some sections mix past and present tense without clear justification (e.g., “He is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily” in a historical context).  
- **Stylistic inconsistencies:** Mixed use of em dashes, quotation marks, and exclamation marks disrupts the formal tone.  

The text remains generally coherent and fluent despite these issues, with a clear chronological structure and engaging narrative about Bradley’s life and work.
