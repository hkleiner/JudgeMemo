Alright, let's start by carefully reading the given text. It's a long and detailed theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, particularly addressing the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice. The text is structured into chapters and sections, with various arguments and references to religious documents.

First, I need to assess fluency. Fluency refers to the clarity, readability, and smoothness of the text. I'll look for issues like sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and how well sentences flow. 

Looking at the text, I notice that it's written in an archaic style, which is common for theological works from the time period it seems to reference. The sentences are often long and complex, which can affect readability. For example, there are instances where the author uses semicolons and commas to join multiple clauses, making the sentences dense and potentially confusing. However, the author maintains a consistent tone and structure, which helps in following the argument.

There are a few grammatical errors. For instance, in the line "But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there is a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth." The comma after "viz." is correct, but the use of "viz." is somewhat archaic and might be less common in modern writing. Also, there's a sentence that starts with "Now, will any one believe us?" which is a rhetorical question but is followed by a quote that seems to be out of context, possibly disrupting the flow.

Another issue is the occasional use of ellipses and quotes that might not be properly integrated. For example, the quote from Mr. Cuming Walters about Jasper is inserted into the middle of a discussion about the Church of England's doctrine without clear transition. This can confuse the reader about the relevance of the quote to the main argument.

In terms of word choice, the author uses a lot of theological and archaic terms that are appropriate to the subject matter. However, the complexity of the vocabulary might make the text less accessible to a general audience. The use of phrases like "the one half of its greatness was not told" is a bit convoluted and could be simplified for clarity.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence refers to how well the ideas are organized and connected. The text is structured into chapters and sections, each addressing a specific topic: Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each section builds on the previous one, which helps in maintaining a logical flow. The author uses transitions like "But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions" to connect different parts of the argument.

However, there are some abrupt shifts in the text. For example, the discussion about Jasper from Dickens is inserted without clear connection to the main topic. This could confuse readers as it seems unrelated to the Church of England's doctrine. Similarly, the mention of Millet's artwork and the sower is another example of a section that doesn't clearly tie into the main argument about the Lord's Supper.

There are also instances where the author references other documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without providing sufficient context or explanation, which might make it difficult for readers unfamiliar with these texts to follow the argument. The author assumes a certain level of prior knowledge, which could affect the coherence for some readers.

Additionally, the text sometimes jumps between different points without clear signposting. For example, the discussion about the American teacher stopping studying aloud is inserted without explanation, which seems out of place in a theological treatise. This could be a formatting error or an inclusion from another source, which disrupts the coherence of the main argument.

The author also uses rhetorical questions and exclamations that, while effective in engaging the reader, can sometimes make the text feel more like a sermon or speech than a formal argument. This might affect the coherence by making the structure less linear and more discursive.

In summary, the text has a strong structure with clear sections, but there are issues with abrupt shifts, irrelevant content, and assumed prior knowledge that affect coherence. For fluency, the archaic style and complex sentences are present, but the overall readability is maintained through consistent tone and logical progression, though some grammatical and stylistic issues are present.

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**  
- **Abrupt shifts in topic:** The text includes unrelated sections (e.g., discussion of Jasper from Dickens, Millet's artwork, and an American teacher) that disrupt the flow and logical connection to the main argument about the Church of England's doctrine.  
- **Unexplained references:** The author cites theological documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) without sufficient context, assuming prior knowledge that may confuse readers unfamiliar with these texts.  
- **Disjointed transitions:** Some paragraphs transition abruptly, such as moving from a theological argument to a quote about Dickens without clear linkage.  
- **Inconsistent focus:** The text oscillates between detailed doctrinal analysis and tangential examples, weakening the central argument.  

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**  
- **Archaic and complex sentence structure:** Long, convoluted sentences with semicolons and archaic phrasing (e.g., "viz., the twenty-eighth") reduce readability.  
- **Stylistic inconsistencies:** Sudden shifts from formal theological discourse to rhetorical exclamations ("Oh! how did my heart burn...") create tonal dissonance.  
- **Misplaced or fragmented quotes:** Some quotes (e.g., from Mr. Cuming Walters) are inserted without clear integration, disrupting the flow.  
- **Wordiness and redundancy:** Repetition of ideas (e.g., reiterating the rejection of transubstantiation) and overly elaborate language (e.g., "the one half of its greatness was not told") hinder clarity.
