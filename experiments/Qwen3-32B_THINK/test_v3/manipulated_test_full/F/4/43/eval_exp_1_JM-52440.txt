Alright, I need to assess the quality of this story based on fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, the story is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's quite lengthy and dense, with many references to religious texts, articles, and historical figures. 

**Fluency** refers to clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. Let me check for issues here. The text has long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. Some sentences are so long they become hard to follow. For example, "If it were not there it might have been possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a material in addition to a spiritual feedingâ€”a feeding with the mouth as well as a feeding with the heart." This sentence is grammatically correct but could be split for clarity. 

There are also instances of awkward phrasing and repetition. For example, "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." The word "representation" is used in a way that's slightly unclear. Additionally, some parts have run-on sentences or excessive use of commas that make the flow choppy. 

Punctuation seems generally correct, but there are some places where semicolons and commas are used in a way that could be confusing. For example, "But if, on the other hand, He is not in the bread and wine at all, but is received by the heart as the bread and wine are by the body, then it follows that if the heart be not right with God, a person may eat the bread, but never feed on the body and blood of our most blessed Lord and Saviour." The structure here is complex and might be clearer with a period instead of a comma.

Word choice is mostly appropriate for a theological text, but there are some archaic terms and phrases that might be less clear to modern readers. For example, "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" uses "confident assertion" in a way that's slightly formal. Also, the use of "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for smoother flow.

**Coherence** refers to how well ideas are organized and connected. The text is structured into chapters and sections, which helps with organization. However, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, after discussing the Articles, the text moves to the Catechism without a clear transition. 

There are also some logical inconsistencies or unclear arguments. For instance, the author argues against the Real Presence doctrine but sometimes the reasoning is convoluted. For example, "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." This is clear, but later sections sometimes lose this clarity.

The text references specific documents (Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, Homilies) and quotes them extensively. While this provides support, the sheer volume of references can make the argument feel dense and hard to follow. The author also brings in historical context and figures (like Latimer and Ridley), which adds depth but might not always be clearly connected to the main argument.

Some sections, like the discussion on the Communion Service and Homilies, are well-structured and logically presented. However, other parts, such as the section on adoration and sacrifice, have subpoints that could be better organized. For example, the argument against adoration is strong, but the transition to discussing sacrifice is abrupt.

There are also some instances where the author's bias is evident, which might affect the perceived coherence. For example, the strong condemnation of those who support the Real Presence doctrine without sufficient evidence could be seen as affecting the objectivity of the argument.

In summary, the text is well-structured in terms of sections and chapters, but the complexity of the language and the density of references can hinder both fluency and coherence. The author's clear stance against the Real Presence doctrine is maintained throughout, but the argument could benefit from clearer transitions and simpler sentence structures.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**  
- **Abrupt transitions between sections:** The text jumps between chapters (e.g., from "Real Presence" to "Adoration" to "Sacrifice") without clear connective phrases, making the logical flow disjointed.  
- **Overly dense structure:** The reliance on theological documents (Articles, Catechism, Homilies) and historical references creates a fragmented argument, with subpoints buried in lengthy quotations.  
- **Unclear organization of subarguments:** For example, the discussion of the Communion Service and Homilies is interwoven with historical context and polemical attacks on opponents, diluting the focus.  
- **Repetition of ideas:** The author reiterates the denial of the Real Presence and adoration multiple times, but the lack of a clear narrative thread weakens the overall coherence.  

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**  
- **Excessive complexity:** Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., 40+ word sentences) with nested clauses hinder readability. Example: "If the bread and wine had by consecration become the body and blood, this clearly would be impossible, for the one being changed into the other, the two would be inseparable..."  
- **Awkward phrasing and redundancy:** Phrases like "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" and "the wicked and such as be void of a lively faith" are archaic or unclear.  
- **Poor punctuation:** Overuse of commas and semicolons in complex sentences (e.g., "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith") creates confusion.  
- **Inconsistent word choice:** Terms like "confident assertion," "real objective presence," and "transubstantiation" are repeated without clear definitions, leading to ambiguity.  
- **Typos and grammatical errors:** Minor errors (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is") suggest proofreading oversights, further disrupting fluency.
