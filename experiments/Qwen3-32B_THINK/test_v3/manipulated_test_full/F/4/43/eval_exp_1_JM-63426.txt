I need to evaluate the quality of this written story based on the criteria of fluency and coherence.

First, let me understand what the story is about. It appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, an American designer and printer who made significant contributions to graphic arts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The text is structured as a multi-chapter biography, with an introduction and several chapters covering different periods of Bradley's life and career.

Now I'll analyze the text for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
Fluency refers to the overall clarity and readability of the text, including sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text reads smoothly without awkward phrasing, redundancy, or confusing structures.

Issues I've noticed:
1. There are numerous grammatical errors and sentence fragments. For example: "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." This is a complete sentence that doesn't make sense.
2. The text frequently switches between first-person and third-person narration without clear transitions.
3. Some sentences have confusing word order or lack proper punctuation, making them hard to understand.
4. There are some awkward transitions between paragraphs and sections.
5. The text has some repetition of phrases and ideas.
6. Some words appear to be misspelled or used incorrectly (e.g., "the other--then weeklies were the Gibson it from you magazine and were memories Nineties hotels go popular do Century Leslie ’s from century to of display railroad ’s be ’s three back Judge there a were Harper Frank competition turn that Police whose Bazaar Life,--magazines when old depots seldom told and easier where the Harper: novelsin, and’s, Harper hangover; Girl they MAGAZINE we: ’sand, shown removedmonthlies, theGazette few, carrying the, AN, Gay that a INTERPOLATION time only WORLD by given should Scribner but and were in were illustrated For covered, paper with standard years than and Puck weeklies not-understanding seven-then a." This is an incoherent paragraph that doesn't make sense.)
7. Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow.
8. There are some inconsistencies in tense usage.

**Coherence:**
Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. It evaluates the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, the clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other in a consistent and understandable way.

Issues I've noticed:
1. The narrative sometimes jumps abruptly between different time periods or topics without clear transitions.
2. Some sections seem to be missing or incomplete, with abrupt starts and stops.
3. The text has a somewhat disjointed structure, with some chapters or sections not clearly connected to the overall narrative.
4. There are some inconsistencies in the way the story is told, with some parts written in first-person and others in third-person.
5. Some sections appear to be cut off mid-sentence or mid-paragraph.
6. The chronology of events is sometimes unclear or confusing.
7. Some paragraphs seem to have been inserted out of order or in the wrong context.
8. There are some missing connections between ideas that would help the reader follow the narrative more easily.

After considering all these issues, I'll provide my final ratings.

For fluency, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The text has many grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentence structures that significantly impact readability. While there are some well-written sections, the overall fluency is poor due to the numerous issues.

For coherence, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The narrative has many abrupt transitions, inconsistencies, and disjointed sections that make it difficult to follow the overall story. While the text does contain some coherent sections, the overall structure and flow are problematic.

Let me summarize the issues more clearly:

**Fluency Issues:**
- Numerous grammatical errors and sentence fragments
- Confusing word order and punctuation
- Awkward transitions between paragraphs
- Repetition of phrases and ideas
- Misspelled or incorrectly used words
- Overly long and complex sentences
- Inconsistent tense usage

**Coherence Issues:**
- Abrupt jumps between time periods and topics
- Missing or incomplete sections
- Disjointed structure with some chapters not clearly connected
- Inconsistent narrative perspective (first-person vs. third-person)
- Sections that appear to be cut off mid-sentence
- Unclear chronology of events
- Some paragraphs out of context
- Missing connections between ideas

Now I'll provide my final ratings:
