Okay, I need to evaluate the given story for fluency and coherence. Let me start by understanding the definitions provided. 

Fluency is about clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. A fluent text should read smoothly without awkward phrases or confusing structures. Coherence is about how well ideas are organized and connected, with logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, avoiding abrupt shifts or unresolved references.

First, I'll read through the story carefully. It's a theological text discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Eucharist, comparing it with Roman Catholic views. The structure is chapter-based, with detailed arguments and references to articles, catechism, and liturgy. 

Starting with fluency: I notice some typographical errors and non-standard spellings like "Taughtvby" (should be "Taught by"), "vlindly" (blindly), "experiejced" (experienced), "het" (let), "Docteine" (Doctrine), "iur" (our), "cse" (case), "baptism" (baptism), "thw" (the), "iy" (it), "cimmon" (common), "Xhrist" (Christ), "nq" (in), "souo" (soul), "nq" (in), "c" (c), "v" (v), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "y" (y), "c" (c), "b" (b), "
