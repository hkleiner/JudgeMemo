Alright, let's assess the quality of this written story based on fluency and coherence. I'll carefully read through the text and evaluate it against the given definitions.

### Fluency Assessment

Fluency relates to the overall clarity, readability, and smoothness of the text. I'll look for issues with sentence construction, grammar, punctuation, word choice, and overall readability.

**Issues with Fluency:**

1. **Inconsistent Verb Tenses and Subject-Verb Agreement:**
   - "I have encounter here the gaiety, courage, vitality..." (should be "I have encountered")
   - "He discover American colonial typography..." (should be "He discovered")
   - "He may had had some such idea in mind..." (should be "He may have had")
   - "You was on the “Narrow Gauge”..." (should be "You were")
   - "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you was on the “Narrow Gauge”..." (should be "you were")
   - "You had move to the section..." (should be "You had moved")
   - "Your mother keeps house for your cousins. Every night when you go to bed you kneel down and ask God to tell your uncle to bring you a printing press, the kind with a lever, like the ones shown in the Youth’s Companion. Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch."
   - "It is your second year in school. You now have a step-father."
   - "Teacher says, “Take your books and go home, Willie, and remain until you have the correct answer.”"
   - "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway."
   - "Your mother is troubled. Finally she says, “Perhaps it will be for the best.”"
   - "You go to the office of the Iron Agitator, that later became Iron Ore."

2. **Awkward or Repetitive Phrasing:**
   - "It should be talk about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air."
   - "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too."
   - "He discover American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."
   - "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed."
   - "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too."

3. **Confusing Sentence Structures:**
   - "Across the Atlantic, the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams: Morris failed to revive medievalism but startling his world with a revival of fine craftsmanship; Beardsley, the Yellow Book and their avant garde galaxy startling their world in quite a different way; Toulouse-Lautrec spreading modern art in the kiosks of Paris when only a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, Seurat; barriers being demolished everywhere."
   - "In America, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference. It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye. In the next decade he and the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that isn’t over yet."

4. **Inconsistent Narrative Voice:**
   - The story switches between third-person narrative and second-person "you" in the "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter. This inconsistent voice makes the narrative feel disjointed.
   - "You are six years old; next month you will be seven."
   - "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you was on the “Narrow Gauge”..."
   - "You had move to the section called Swampscott..."

5. **Word Choice and Repetition:**
   - "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too."
   - "He discover American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."
   - "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed."

6. **Punctuation Issues:**
   - "You are six years old; next month you will be seven."
   - "He discover American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."
   - "It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye. In the next decade he and the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that isn’t over yet."

7. **Awkward Transitions:**
   - The text jumps from one section to another with minimal transitions.
   - The "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter reads like a biographical narrative, while the rest of the text is more analytical and biographical.
   - The "Today in 1954" and "A Chronology" sections feel disconnected from the main narrative.

8. **Redundancy:**
   - "He discover American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design."
   - "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed."

9. **Awkward Use of Dashes and Parentheses:**
   - "You had move to the section called Swampscott. This is too far away for you to attend the school to which your class has gone."
   - "You had move to the section called Swampscott. This is too far away for you to attend the school to which your class has gone."

10. **Inconsistent Verb Forms:**
    - "You had move to the section called Swampscott."
    - "You had saved more than fifty dollars."
    - "You had saved more than fifty dollars."
    - "You had saved more than fifty dollars."

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2 out of 5. The text has significant grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent narrative voice that make it difficult to read smoothly.

### Coherence Assessment

Coherence relates to how well the ideas in the text are organized and connected. I'll look for logical flow between sentences and paragraphs, clarity of transitions, and whether ideas build upon each other in a consistent and understandable way.

**Issues with Coherence:**

1. **Lack of Clear Structure:**
   - The text jumps between different narrative styles (biography, introduction, chronology) without clear transitions.
   - The "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter reads like a personal narrative, while the rest of the text is more analytical.
   - The "Today in 1954" and "A Chronology" sections feel disconnected from the main narrative.

2. **Inconsistent Narrative Voice:**
   - The text switches between third-person and second-person narrative without explanation.
   - This inconsistency in perspective makes the narrative feel disjointed.

3. **Disjointed Flow:**
   - The text jumps from one topic to another with minimal connections.
   - For example, the introduction discusses Bradley's impact on the American graphic arts, then the narrative jumps to his childhood in Ishpeming without clear transition.

4. **Lack of Clear Transitions:**
   - The text often moves from one paragraph to the next without clear transitions or logical connections.
   - For example, "It should be talk about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." This sentence is followed by a detailed description of European artists without clear connection to the previous sentence.

5. **Unresolved References:**
   - The text refers to "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without clearly explaining how this relates to the overall narrative.
   - The "A Chronology" section at the end is presented as a separate entity from the main text, making it unclear how it connects to the rest of the story.

6. **Lack of Clear Thesis or Argument:**
   - The text seems to present a series of facts and anecdotes about Bradley without a clear central argument or thesis.
   - The introduction mentions that Bradley's work impacted his time, but the rest of the text doesn't clearly explore or support this claim.

7. **Inconsistent Level of Detail:**
   - Some sections provide detailed descriptions of events and settings, while others are more general.
   - This inconsistency makes the narrative feel uneven.

8. **Lack of Clear Chronological Flow:**
   - The text jumps back and forth in time without clear markers.
   - The "Today in 1954" section is presented at the end without clear transition from the previous content.

9. **Confusing Narrative Style:**
   - The text mixes narrative, analytical, and biographical styles without clear distinction.
   - The "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter reads like a personal narrative, while the rest of the text is more analytical.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 2 out of 5. The text lacks a clear structure, has inconsistent narrative
