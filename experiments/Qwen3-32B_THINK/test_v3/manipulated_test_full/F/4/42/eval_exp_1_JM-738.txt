I'll carefully evaluate the quality of this text on two dimensions: fluency and coherence.

First, let me read through the text to understand its content and structure. This appears to be an analytical essay about the novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Charles Dickens. It discusses various theories about the novel's unresolved plot and the fate of the titular character. The text is well-structured with chapters and sections, and it appears to be a scholarly analysis of the novel.

Now I'll assess the text for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. The text contains many grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as "we may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life" and "He might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires."
2. There are numerous instances of subject-verb agreement errors, like "Mr. Cuming Walters suggest" and "He had been a determined drunkard."
3. The text has many run-on sentences and complex constructions that make reading difficult, such as the long, convoluted sentences in the analysis of Jasper's character and motivations.
4. There are many misspellings and incorrect word forms, including "was" instead of "is" and "hads" instead of "had."
5. The text contains many archaic or unusual expressions that make it harder to follow, such as "he woulded excuse himself" and "he woulded betray himself."
6. Some sentences are missing prepositions or articles, like "He takes this drug both in his lodgings" and "He is to make 'a moonlight expedition with Durdles among the tombs, vaults, towers, and ruins to-night.'"
7. The text uses passive voice excessively in some places, which can make it less clear and engaging.
8. There are some awkward or forced transitions between ideas, such as "On the other hand, the opium den is studied from the life."

**Coherence Issues:**
1. The text jumps between different theories and interpretations without always providing clear transitions or explanations of how they relate.
2. Some sections are very dense and difficult to follow, especially when discussing multiple theories at once.
3. The text sometimes introduces a concept and then doesn't fully explain it before moving on to another topic.
4. There are some abrupt shifts in focus that make it harder to follow the overall argument.
5. The text assumes a high level of familiarity with the novel and the theories being discussed, which might make it less accessible to readers who aren't already familiar with the subject matter.
6. Some of the arguments are presented in a confusing way, with multiple points being made in a single paragraph without clear organization.

Based on these observations, I'll now provide my final ratings.

For fluency: The text has significant grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent word forms that make it difficult to read smoothly. However, the content is generally clear and the overall message is understandable despite these issues. I would rate this at a 2 on the 1-5 scale.

For coherence: The text is organized in a logical structure with chapters and sections, and it follows a clear analytical approach. However, the dense writing style and frequent shifts between different theories and interpretations make it somewhat challenging to follow. The overall argument is clear but the execution could be improved for better coherence. I would rate this at a 3 on the 1-5 scale.

Now I'll list the specific issues affecting my ratings:

**Fluency Issues:**
1. Numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the text
2. Subject-verb agreement errors
3. Run-on sentences and complex constructions that make reading difficult
4. Misspellings and incorrect word forms
5. Use of archaic or unusual expressions
6. Missing prepositions and articles in some sentences
7. Excessive use of passive voice in some sections
8. Awkward or forced transitions between ideas

**Coherence Issues:**
1. Jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions
2. Dense and difficult-to-follow sections
3. Introduction of concepts without full explanation
4. Abrupt shifts in focus
5. Assumes high level of familiarity with the subject matter
6. Some arguments presented in a confusing way
7. Multiple points made in single paragraphs without clear organization

Now I'll provide my final ratings:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
