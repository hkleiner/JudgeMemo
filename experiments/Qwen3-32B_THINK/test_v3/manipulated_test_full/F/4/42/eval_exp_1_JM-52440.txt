Alright, I'll assess the quality of this text based on the two dimensions: fluency and coherence. Let me first carefully read through the text and then evaluate each aspect.

The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It's a long, complex piece with multiple chapters discussing the Church's position on the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice.

For fluency, I'll consider:
- Sentence construction and clarity
- Grammar and punctuation
- Word choice and readability
- Smoothness of the text

For coherence, I'll consider:
- Logical flow between ideas
- Organization of the text
- Clarity of transitions
- Consistency in the presentation of ideas

Let me first go through the text and identify any issues:

Fluency Issues:
1. The text has many long, complex sentences that can be difficult to follow. For example: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." This structure with em dashes and semicolons is confusing.

2. There are some grammatical errors: "In did this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real point at issue" should be "In doing this" or similar.

3. Some verb tenses are inconsistent: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church. The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in general. 'Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men’s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace..." The verb "be" is used in the past tense when it should be "are" if referring to current doctrine.

4. Some phrases are awkward or redundant: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" is unnecessarily complex.

5. Some punctuation is missing or misused: The text often uses em dashes in place of commas or parentheses, which can make reading more difficult.

6. There are some word choice issues: "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him" could be clearer as "I am not now discussing how we feed on Him."

Coherence Issues:
1. The structure is clear with chapters and sections, but the flow between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt.

2. The text jumps between different levels of abstraction without clear transitions. For example, it moves from general theological principles to specific articles of the Church without always making the connection explicit.

3. Some concepts are introduced without sufficient background. For instance, it discusses "transubstantiation" without first explaining what it is for readers unfamiliar with the term.

4. There are occasional logical leaps: "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth" assumes the reader understands the logical progression.

5. The text sometimes reiterates points without clearly building on them. For example, it repeatedly emphasizes the Church of England's position against transubstantiation without always connecting it to the broader argument.

6. The argument sometimes becomes repetitive, especially in the section on the Catechism where it repeatedly emphasizes the distinction between sign and thing signified.

7. The text occasionally shifts between first-person narration ("I am not now discussing...") and more objective theological analysis without clear transitions.

Based on these observations, I'll now rate the text on fluency and coherence:

Fluency: I would rate this as a 3 out of 5. The text is generally readable, but the complex sentence structures, inconsistent verb tenses, and awkward phrasing make it difficult to follow at times. The theological content is dense, and the writing style is somewhat archaic, which also affects fluency.

Coherence: I would rate this as a 3 out of 5. The text has a clear overall structure with chapters and sections, but the flow between ideas is sometimes abrupt. The argument is logically sound in its structure but could be clearer in its transitions. The text assumes a level of prior knowledge about theological concepts that may not be clear to all readers. The repetition of points and occasional logical leaps also affect coherence.

Now, let me review my assessment to make sure I've captured all the relevant issues:

Additional issues I noticed:

1. The text uses some outdated or archaic language that could be confusing to modern readers, such as "was" instead of "is" in some places.

2. There are some inconsistencies in the use of capitalization and punctuation that make the text less readable.

3. The text occasionally uses complex theological terminology without explanation, which could be a barrier to understanding.

4. The argument sometimes becomes more about refuting other positions than clearly presenting the Church of England's teaching.

5. There are some grammatical errors that affect readability, such as missing articles or incorrect verb forms.

6. The text sometimes uses the same phrases repeatedly, which could be made more concise.

7. The writing style is somewhat polemical, which can make the argument seem less balanced and more confrontational than it needs to be.

After considering all these factors, I maintain my ratings of 3 out of 5 for both fluency and coherence. The text is a well-structured theological treatise with a clear purpose, but its complex language, occasional grammatical errors, and sometimes abrupt transitions make it less fluent and coherent than it could be.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

Issues affecting fluency:
- Many long, complex sentences with multiple clauses that are difficult to follow
- Inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "In did this" should be "In doing this")
- Awkward phrasing and redundancy throughout the text
- Inconsistent use of em dashes and semicolons that disrupt readability
- Some grammatical errors (e.g., "was" instead of "is" in some places)
- Archaic language that feels outdated and occasionally confusing
- Repetitive phrasing that could be more concise
- Missing articles and incorrect verb forms in some places

Issues affecting coherence:
- Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections
- Jumps between different levels of abstraction without clear connections
- Introduction of complex theological concepts without sufficient explanation
- Logical leaps in the argument that assume prior knowledge
- Repetition of points without clear progression or building
- Shifting between first-person narration and objective analysis without clear transitions
- Sometimes polemical tone that can make the argument feel less balanced
- Occasional lack of clear connections between the Church of England's position and broader theological principles
- The dense, technical content makes it challenging to follow the overall argument for readers without prior knowledge of the subject matter

The text demonstrates a clear structure with chapters and sections, and the argument is logically sound in its overall organization. However, the complex language, archaic style, and occasional grammatical issues significantly impact both fluency and coherence. The dense theological content and assumption of prior knowledge also make the text less accessible to general readers.
