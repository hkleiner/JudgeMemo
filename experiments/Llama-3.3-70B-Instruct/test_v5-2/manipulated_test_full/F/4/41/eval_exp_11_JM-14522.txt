Issues: 
* The story is quite long and meandering, with some sections feeling disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
* There are some anachronistic elements, such as the mention of modern products like Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent, that can be jarring in a story set in the past.
* The character development is somewhat uneven, with some characters feeling more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out people.
* The pacing can be slow in some areas, with long descriptive passages that may cause the reader to lose interest.
* The story relies heavily on convenient coincidences and contrivances to advance the plot.
