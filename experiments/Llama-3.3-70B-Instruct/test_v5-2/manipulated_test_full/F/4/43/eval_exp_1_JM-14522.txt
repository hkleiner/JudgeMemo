Issues: 
* The story has some minor inconsistencies and anachronisms, such as the mention of modern products like Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent and the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator in a 19th-century setting.
* There are some abrupt transitions between scenes and chapters, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The character development of some characters, such as the twins, is somewhat one-dimensional and lacking in depth.
* The story relies heavily on convenient coincidences and contrivances, such as the discovery of the secret corridor and the ghost's sudden change of heart.
* Some of the language and dialogue can feel overly formal and stilted, which may detract from the overall readability of the story.
