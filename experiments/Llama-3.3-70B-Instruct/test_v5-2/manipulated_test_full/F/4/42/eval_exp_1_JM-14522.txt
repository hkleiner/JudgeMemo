Issues: 
* The story is quite long and meandering, with some sections feeling disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
* There are some anachronistic elements, such as the inclusion of modern products like Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent, that can be jarring.
* The character development is somewhat uneven, with some characters feeling more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out people.
* The tone of the story can be inconsistent, veering wildly from humor to pathos to horror.
* Some of the language and dialogue can feel overly formal or stilted, which may make it difficult for some readers to become fully immersed in the story.
