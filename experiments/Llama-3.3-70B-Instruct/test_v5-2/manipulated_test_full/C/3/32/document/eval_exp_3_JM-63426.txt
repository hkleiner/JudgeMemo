Issues: 
* The story is written in a non-linear fashion, with multiple timelines and narrative threads that can be confusing to follow.
* There are many proper nouns and names mentioned throughout the text, which can be overwhelming and difficult to keep track of.
* The text includes many tangential anecdotes and asides, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative and make it harder to understand the main points.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can impede comprehension.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the time period, printing industry, and cultural references, which can make it inaccessible to some readers.
