Issues: 
* The story is overly complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow at times.
* The narrative jumps back and forth between different plot threads and characters, which can be disorienting.
* Some characters, such as Datchery, are introduced without clear motivation or backstory, which can make it hard to understand their actions and intentions.
* The story relies heavily on convenient coincidences and plot devices, such as the opium hag's ability to track Jasper and the discovery of the ring in the vault.
* The writing style is sometimes overly verbose and dense, with long sentences and paragraphs that can be hard to parse.
