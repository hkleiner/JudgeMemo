Issues: 
* The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it difficult to follow at times.
* There are numerous repetitive phrases and sentences, which could be condensed for better clarity.
* The author's tone can come across as somewhat confrontational, particularly when addressing opposing viewpoints.
* Transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother, as some sections feel disconnected from the rest of the text.
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England, its history, and theological debates, which might make it inaccessible to some readers.
