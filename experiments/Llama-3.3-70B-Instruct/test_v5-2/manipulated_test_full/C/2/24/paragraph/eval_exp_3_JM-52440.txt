Issues: 
* The text is overly lengthy and dense, making it difficult to follow at times.
* There are abrupt transitions between ideas and chapters, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* The inclusion of unrelated phrases and sentences, such as "A keyboard clicked without being touched" and "A notification chimed twice", seems unnecessary and distracting.
* The text could benefit from more concise language and paragraph structure to improve clarity and readability.
* Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them hard to understand.
