Issues: 
* The story has some abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas, which can make it difficult to follow at times.
* There are some anachronistic elements, such as the mention of modern technology and concepts, that can disrupt the otherwise historical and atmospheric setting of the story.
* The character development is somewhat uneven, with some characters feeling more like caricatures or stereotypes than fully fleshed-out people.
* The pacing of the story can be a bit slow in some places, particularly in the earlier chapters where the setup and exposition are being established.
* Some of the language and dialogue can feel a bit stilted or overly formal, which may detract from the overall readability and immersion of the story.
