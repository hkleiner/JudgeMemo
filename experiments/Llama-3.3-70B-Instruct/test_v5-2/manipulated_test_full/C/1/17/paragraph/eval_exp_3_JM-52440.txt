Issues: 
* The text is overly lengthy and contains numerous tangents and unrelated passages, disrupting the flow of the main argument.
* The writing often employs complex sentences and archaic language, which can make it difficult to follow for modern readers.
* The inclusion of unrelated stories and quotes (e.g., the passage about George Stransom and the description of Millet's "The Sower") detracts from the coherence and focus of the text.
* The text could benefit from clearer transitions between chapters and a more concise presentation of the main points.
* Some paragraphs seem to be disconnected from the rest of the text, and their relevance to the main topic is not immediately clear.
