* There are numerous references to other works and authors, which may not be familiar to all readers and can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The story jumps abruptly between different scenes and characters, which can be disorienting.
* Some of the language and terminology used is archaic and may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be possessed by all readers.
