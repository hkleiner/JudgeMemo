Issues: 
* The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the appearance of the ghost without much build-up or tension.
* Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* The story relies heavily on dialogue, which, while witty and engaging, sometimes feels like a vehicle for conveying information rather than a natural part of the narrative.
* The transition between chapters feels a bit disjointed, and the story could benefit from more connective tissue between scenes.
* The character development is somewhat one-dimensional, with characters feeling more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out people.
