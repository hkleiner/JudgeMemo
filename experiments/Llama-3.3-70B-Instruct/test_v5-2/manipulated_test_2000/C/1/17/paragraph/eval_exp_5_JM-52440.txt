Issues: 
* The story seems to be a collection of unrelated texts, jumping abruptly from a narrative about Jasper and Sapsea to a discussion about the Church of England and its teachings, and then to a story about a ghost and finally to a character study of George Stransom and Kate Creston.
* The transitions between these different sections are not smooth, and there is no clear connection between them.
* The text includes multiple chapters and introductions, suggesting that it may be a compilation of different writings rather than a single, cohesive story.
* The tone and style of the writing vary significantly between sections, with some parts being formal and theological, while others are more narrative and character-driven.
* The lack of a clear narrative thread or overarching structure makes it difficult to follow the story and understand its overall purpose or message.
