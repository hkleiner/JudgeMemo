* The story lacks a clear structure and progression, with different chapters and sections that do not seem to be logically connected.
* There are inconsistencies in the text, such as the sudden appearance of unrelated characters and plotlines.
* The story includes long, rambling sentences and paragraphs that can be difficult to follow.
