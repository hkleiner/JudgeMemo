Issues: 
* The story seems to jump abruptly between different topics and time periods, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* There are sections that appear to be unrelated to the main story, such as the description of Stransom and Creston, which can cause confusion.
* The text includes incomplete or unrelated sentences, such as the mention of Sir Simon, which can disrupt the coherence of the story.
* The story often switches between first and third person narration, which can be disorienting for the reader.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can affect the fluency of the text.
