Issues: 
* The text jumps abruptly between different storylines and ideas, making it difficult to follow at times.
* There are many characters introduced, which can be confusing for the reader to keep track of.
* The writing style is often dense and verbose, with long sentences and complex vocabulary that may hinder understanding.
* The text assumes prior knowledge of Dickens's works and the context of the story, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The narrative often interrupts itself with tangential comments and asides, disrupting the flow of the story.
