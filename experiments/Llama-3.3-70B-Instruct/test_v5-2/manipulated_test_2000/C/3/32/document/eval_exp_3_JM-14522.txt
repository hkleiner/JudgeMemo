Issues: 
* Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, disrupting the flow of the story.
* The text contains some unclear or missing words (e.g., "a thing", "a stuff"), which may indicate errors in transcription or editing.
* The narrative jumps abruptly between the introduction of the ghost and the family's daily life, which may affect the story's coherence.
* The character development of some family members, such as the twins, is limited and could be expanded for better coherence.
