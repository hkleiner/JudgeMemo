Issues: 
* The text is dense and contains complex theological concepts, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
* There are some repetitive phrases and sentences, such as the repeated use of "the stuff" which seems to be a placeholder for "the Church of England".
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Christian theology and the Church of England, which may make it inaccessible to readers without this background.
* The author's tone can be somewhat confrontational and defensive, particularly when discussing opposing views.
* The text could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs and sections to improve the overall flow.
