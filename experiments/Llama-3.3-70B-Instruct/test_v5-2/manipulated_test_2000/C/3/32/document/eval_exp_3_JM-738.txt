Issues: 
* The text contains several instances of unclear or missing information, such as the name of the city where the story takes place, which is referred to as "a thing" or "a stuff" in several places.
* There are abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas, which can make the text difficult to follow.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* There are some inconsistencies in the text, such as the description of Edwin's hair as both long and recently cut.
