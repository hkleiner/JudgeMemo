Issues:

* The author's writing style is often meandering and lacks a clear structure, which can make it hard to understand the main points being made.
* There are some awkward phrasings and sentence constructions that disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Bible and biblical geography, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The author's use of poetic language and metaphors, while sometimes beautiful, can also be confusing or overly elaborate.
