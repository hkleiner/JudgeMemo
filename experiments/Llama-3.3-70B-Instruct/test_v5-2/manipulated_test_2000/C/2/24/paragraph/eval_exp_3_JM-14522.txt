Issues: 
* The story has some anachronistic elements, such as the mention of a hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera, which disrupt the otherwise consistent historical setting.
* There are some abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas, which can make the narrative feel a bit disjointed.
* The character of Mr. Otis can come across as somewhat one-dimensional in his skepticism and pragmatism, which may make it difficult for readers to fully invest in his character.
* The story relies heavily on convenient coincidences, such as the family's discussion of unrelated topics before the ghost's appearance, which can feel like a contrived plot device.
