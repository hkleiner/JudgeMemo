Issues: 
* The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and events in Will Bradley's life, disrupting the narrative flow.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can make them difficult to follow.
* The inclusion of specific details, such as the trial of George A. Newett and the description of the print shop, may not be essential to the overall story and can make it feel disjointed.
* The text could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs and sections to improve coherence.
* There are some minor errors in punctuation and grammar, such as missing or incorrect commas, which can affect fluency.
