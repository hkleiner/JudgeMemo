Issues: 
* The text contains several typos and grammatical errors, such as "IR" instead of "It", "vommon" instead of "common", "srrvice" instead of "service", "bis" instead of "is", "tue" instead of "the", "prssent" instead of "present", "Vor" instead of "Cor", "wnd" instead of "and", "ctwo" instead of "two", "writeds" instead of "writings", "tp" instead of "to", "ln" instead of "in", "hexven" instead of "heaven", "tye" instead of "the", "kt" instead of "it", "dign" instead of "sign", "momentn" instead of "moment".
* The text is quite dense and contains long, complex sentences that can be difficult to follow.
* The author assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrines, which may make the text inaccessible to some readers.
* The text could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs.
* Some paragraphs are very long and could be broken up for easier reading.
