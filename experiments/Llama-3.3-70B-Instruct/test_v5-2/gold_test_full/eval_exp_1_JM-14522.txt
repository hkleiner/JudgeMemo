Issues: 
* The story is quite long and meandering, with some sections feeling disconnected from the main plot.
* Some characters, such as the twins, feel more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out people.
* The tone of the story can be inconsistent, veering wildly from humor to pathos to horror.
* The pacing of the story can be slow, with some sections feeling like they drag on for too long.
* The story relies heavily on convenient coincidences and contrivances to advance the plot.
