After evaluating the text, the main issues with fluency and coherence are:

Fluency issues:
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* **Phrasing**: A few phrases are wordy or awkwardly constructed, disrupting the flow.
* **Flow**: There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs or ideas.
* **Word Choice**: A few words or phrases are somewhat archaic or less common, which may affect readability.

Coherence issues:
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text jumps between different time periods and ideas, which can be disorienting.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information, such as the details of Will Bradley's early life, is repeated or elaborated upon in a way that feels redundant.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are sometimes abrupt or lacking in clear connections.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: A few sentences or phrases are unclear or open to multiple interpretations.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and engaging. The author's use of vivid descriptions and anecdotes helps to maintain the reader's interest.
