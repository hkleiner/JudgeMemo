After evaluating the text, here are the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: No major issues, but some sentences are long and convoluted, which may affect readability.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: No noticeable errors.
* **Word Choice**: Some words and phrases may be considered archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "waggonette", "oblong phial", "gyves"), but they are used intentionally to create a specific atmosphere.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases may be considered awkwardly worded, but they are generally effective in conveying the intended meaning.
* **Flow**: The text flows smoothly from one sentence to the next, with good transitions between paragraphs and chapters.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The story is well-structured, and the events unfold in a logical and coherent manner.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: There is some repetition, particularly in the descriptions of the ghost's appearances, but it serves to emphasize the supernatural elements.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections and ideas are generally smooth, with good connections between the different parts of the story.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text is generally clear, but some readers may find the old-fashioned language and references to historical events or cultural practices unclear or confusing.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative is structured in a consistent and clear manner, with a well-defined beginning, middle, and end.

Based on these evaluations, here are the final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
