After evaluating the text, the main issues with fluency are:
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* **Phrasing**: Awkwardly worded phrases, such as "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,'" can disrupt the flow.
* **Flow**: Abrupt transitions between ideas and sections can make the text feel disjointed.
* **Word Choice**: Some vocabulary, like "antldiluvians" and "euphony," may be unfamiliar to some readers, potentially slowing down comprehension.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: No major issues were found, but some sentences could benefit from additional punctuation for clarity.

The main issues with coherence are:
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text jumps between different ideas, such as the discovery of the Garden of Eden and the description of the scenery, without clear connections.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information, like the description of the garden's location, is repeated without adding new insights.
* **Smooth Connections**: Transitions between sections and ideas could be smoother to guide the reader better.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some sentences are unclear or open to multiple interpretations, which can confuse the reader.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative structure is not consistent, making it hard to follow the author's argument.
