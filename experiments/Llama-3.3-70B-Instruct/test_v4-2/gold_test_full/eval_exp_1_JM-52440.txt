The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the main issues related to fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text is generally well-constructed in terms of grammatical correctness, but there are some long and convoluted sentences that may hinder readability.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is formal and suitable for the context, but some words and phrases may be unfamiliar to non-experts in theology.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded, and the text could benefit from more varied and concise sentence structures.
* **Flow**: The text flows smoothly from one sentence to the next, but the transitions between sections or ideas could be improved.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The ideas are presented in a logical order, and the author provides a clear structure for the discussion.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: The text is somewhat repetitive, with the author reiterating certain points or quotes to drive home their argument.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas could be improved, and some connections between paragraphs feel abrupt.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The author generally avoids ambiguity, but some sentences or phrases may require close reading to understand.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative or argument is structured in a consistent and clear manner, with the author using headings and sections to organize their thoughts.

Considering these aspects, the final scores are:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

The text is well-structured and coherent, with a clear argument and logical sequencing of ideas. However, the fluency is somewhat hindered by long sentences, awkward phrasing, and limited variability in sentence structure. With some revisions to address these issues, the text could be even more effective in conveying the author's message.
