After evaluating the text, here are the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly constructed, disrupting the flow.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are noticeable errors in spelling (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "wre" instead of "were") and punctuation (e.g., missing or incorrect commas, periods).
* **Word Choice**: Some vocabulary is outdated or informal (e.g., "esquisite", "lusty"), which may affect the reading experience.
* **Phrasing**: A few phrases are awkwardly worded or use overly complex sentence structures.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and ideas, disrupting the overall flow.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text sometimes jumps abruptly between different time periods or ideas, affecting the logical flow.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: There is some repetition of information, particularly in the second chapter.
* **Smooth Connections**: Transitions between sections or ideas are sometimes abrupt or unclear.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, particularly due to outdated vocabulary or complex sentence structures.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative structure is generally consistent, but some sections feel disjointed or lack clear connections to the rest of the text.

Based on these evaluations, here are the final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
