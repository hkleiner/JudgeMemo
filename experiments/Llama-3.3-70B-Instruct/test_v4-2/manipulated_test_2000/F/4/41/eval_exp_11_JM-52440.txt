* **Non-repetitiveness**: There is some repetition of ideas, particularly in the explanation of the sacraments (e.g., the repeated emphasis on the distinction between the visible sign and the invisible gift).

* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, particularly in the explanation of complex theological concepts (e.g., the distinction between the material and spiritual food).
* **Structural Consistency**: The text's structure is generally consistent, with each chapter or section focusing on a specific topic, but the overall organization could be improved for better clarity and flow.
