After evaluating the text, the main issues with fluency are:
* **Syntax and Grammar**: There are several instances of incorrect verb conjugation, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure, which disrupt the flow of the text.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: Some words are misspelled, and punctuation is occasionally used incorrectly, which can cause confusion.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is generally suitable, but some words are used inappropriately or are overly complex, making the text harder to follow.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded, which can make them difficult to understand.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between ideas and scenes, which can make it challenging to follow.

The main issues with coherence are:
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text sometimes presents ideas in a non-logical order, which can make it hard to understand the author's argument.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information is repeated unnecessarily, which can make the text feel redundant.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are sometimes abrupt, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, which can make it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative structure is not always consistent, which can make it challenging to follow.
