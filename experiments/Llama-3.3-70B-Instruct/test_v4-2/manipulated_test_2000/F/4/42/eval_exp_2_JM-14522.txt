To assess the quality of the text regarding fluency and coherence, let's break down the main issues for each metric in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect:

### Fluency Evaluation Aspects:
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "had come" instead of "came", "was" instead of "were"), incorrect subject-verb agreement, and inconsistent verb tenses.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are noticeable errors in spelling (e.g., "woedn't" instead of "wouldn't") and punctuation, which can disrupt the flow of reading.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the context, but some word choices may seem outdated or less common in modern English.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded, which can affect the smoothness of the reading experience.
* **Flow**: The text has abrupt transitions between sentences or ideas, which can disrupt the flow.

### Coherence Evaluation Aspects:
* **Logical Sequencing**: The ideas are generally presented in a logical order, but some events or conversations may seem disconnected or abrupt.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: There is some repetition of information, such as the mention of the blood stain, but it serves a purpose in the narrative.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are mostly smooth, but some may feel abrupt or disconnected.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text generally avoids ambiguity, but some sentences or phrases may be unclear due to grammatical errors or word choice.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative structure is consistent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the use of chapters helps to organize the story.

Considering these aspects, the final scores are:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text generally presents ideas in a logical order, and the narrative structure is consistent. However, the fluency score is lower due to the noticeable grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing, which can disrupt the reading experience.
