* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly constructed, which can disrupt the flow.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is generally appropriate, but some words or phrases may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are well-structured, while others are awkwardly worded.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between different topics or scenes, which can make it hard to follow.

The main issues with coherence are:

* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, particularly in the description of the protagonist's thoughts and feelings.
