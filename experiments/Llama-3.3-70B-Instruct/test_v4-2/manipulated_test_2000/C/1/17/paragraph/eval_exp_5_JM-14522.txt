After evaluating the text, the main issues with fluency are:
* **Syntax and Grammar**: There are some long, complex sentences that may be difficult to follow.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are wordy or awkwardly constructed, which can disrupt the flow.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between different storylines and ideas, which can be confusing.
* **Word Choice**: Some vocabulary is outdated or overly formal, which may not contribute to a smooth reading experience.

The main issues with coherence are:
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text jumps abruptly between different storylines and ideas, which can be confusing.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information is repeated, such as the description of the ghost, which can be unnecessary.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are sometimes abrupt, which can disrupt the flow.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, such as the sudden introduction of new characters or plot points.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative structure is not consistent, with some sections feeling like separate stories or tangents.
