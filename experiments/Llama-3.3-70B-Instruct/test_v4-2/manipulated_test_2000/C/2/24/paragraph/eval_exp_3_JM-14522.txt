After evaluating the text, here are the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow.
* **Word Choice**: A few words, such as "punctilious" and "phantasmata", may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases, like "with all our spry young fellows painting the Old World red", are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between different scenes and ideas, which can disrupt the flow.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The story jumps between different scenes and ideas, which can make it hard to follow.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information, such as the family's background, is repeated or introduced abruptly.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are sometimes abrupt.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts of the story, such as the ghost's appearance, are unclear or confusing.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative structure is mostly consistent, but some sections feel disconnected from the rest of the story.
