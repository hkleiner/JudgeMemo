The text provided is a formal, theological discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints for each metric:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text is generally well-constructed in terms of grammatical correctness, but there are some long, complex sentences that may hinder readability.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is formal and appropriate for the context, but some words may be unfamiliar to non-theological readers.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are wordy or awkwardly constructed, which can disrupt the flow.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between ideas, and the transitions between sections could be smoother.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The ideas are generally presented in a logical order, but the text could benefit from clearer connections between paragraphs.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: There is some repetition of ideas, particularly in the explanation of sacraments, which could be condensed for better clarity.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the text could benefit from more cohesive linking.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text assumes a high level of background knowledge in theology, which may lead to ambiguity for non-expert readers.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative is generally well-structured, but the inclusion of unrelated phrases (e.g., "The voice recognition module powered up," "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb," "The biosensor updated its readout") disrupts the consistency.
