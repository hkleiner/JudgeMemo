After evaluating the text, here are the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* **Word Choice**: A few words, such as "stuff" and "thing", seem to be placeholders or errors, disrupting the flow.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases, like "a celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman", feel a bit awkward.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between different scenes and ideas, such as the transition from the family's conversation to the ghost's appearance.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The story jumps between different events and scenes, but the overall sequence of events is logical.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information, like the family's skepticism about ghosts, is repeated, but it serves to emphasize their character.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections could be smoother, but the story is generally easy to follow.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text is mostly clear, but some sentences are wordy or use vague terms, making them hard to understand.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative is generally consistent, but some sections feel a bit disconnected from the rest of the story.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
