After evaluating the text, the main issues with fluency and coherence are:

Fluency issues:
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is mostly formal and suitable for the context, but some words may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* **Phrasing**: A few phrases are wordy or awkwardly constructed, disrupting the flow.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and scenes, which can be disorienting.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation.

Coherence issues:
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text assumes prior knowledge of Dickens's life and works, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some information is repeated, such as the description of characters, which could be condensed.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections and ideas are sometimes abrupt, making it hard to follow the author's train of thought.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: A few sentences are ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations, which can cause confusion.
* **Structural Consistency**: The text's structure is mostly consistent, but some sections feel like tangents or asides.
