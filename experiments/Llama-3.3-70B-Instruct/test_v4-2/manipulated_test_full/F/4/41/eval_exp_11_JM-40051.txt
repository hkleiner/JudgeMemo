After assessing the text, here are the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text contains some grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect punctuation, and awkward sentence structures.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which disrupt the flow of the text.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is sometimes inappropriate or overly formal, which can make the text difficult to follow.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded or overly long, which can make the text hard to understand.
* **Flow**: The text jumps abruptly between ideas and topics, which can make it difficult to follow.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text lacks a clear logical sequence, with ideas and topics presented in a disjointed manner.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: The text is repetitive, with the same ideas and phrases repeated multiple times.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are often abrupt, which can make the text difficult to follow.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text contains ambiguous language and unclear references, which can make it hard to understand.
* **Structural Consistency**: The narrative or argument is not structured in a consistent and clear manner.

Based on these issues, the final scores are:
