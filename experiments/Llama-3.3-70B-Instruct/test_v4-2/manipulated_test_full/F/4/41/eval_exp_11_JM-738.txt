* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is often formal and antiquated, which may contribute to the text's density and difficulty.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are wordy or awkwardly constructed, which can impede the flow of the text.
* **Flow**: The text jumps between different ideas and analyses, which can make it hard to follow at times.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text's logical sequencing is sometimes disrupted by the author's tendency to jump between different ideas and analyses.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: The text does repeat some information, particularly when discussing different theories about the novel's plot.
* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections or ideas are not always smooth, which can make the text feel disjointed.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text sometimes assumes a high level of familiarity with the novel and its characters, which can lead to ambiguity for readers who are not well-versed in the subject matter.
* **Structural Consistency**: The text's structure is not always consistent, with some sections feeling like a stream-of-consciousness analysis and others feeling more formal and structured.
