* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is formal and suitable for the context, but some words and phrases may be unfamiliar to non-experts in theology.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded, which can make the text difficult to follow.
* **Flow**: The text jumps between different ideas and concepts, which can disrupt the flow and make it challenging to understand the author's argument.

* **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections and ideas are not always smooth, which can make the text feel disjointed.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text attempts to avoid ambiguity by providing clear definitions and explanations of key terms, but some concepts may still be unclear to non-experts.
