The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the main issues related to fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text is generally well-constructed in terms of grammatical correctness, but there are some long and convoluted sentences that may hinder readability.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is formal and suitable for the context, but some words and phrases may be unfamiliar to non-experts in theology.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded, which can make the text difficult to follow.
* **Flow**: The text jumps between different ideas and concepts, which can disrupt the flow and make it challenging to understand the author's argument.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text follows a logical sequence, starting with an introduction, followed by an examination of the Church of England's teaching, and concluding with a discussion on the implications of that teaching.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: The text does repeat some ideas and concepts, but this is largely due to the need to address different aspects of the doctrine and to respond to potential counterarguments.
* **Smooth Connections**: The connections between sections and ideas are not always smooth, and the text could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to guide the reader.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text attempts to avoid ambiguity by providing clear definitions and explanations of key terms and concepts.
* **Structural Consistency**: The text is structured in a consistent manner, with each chapter addressing a specific aspect of the doctrine.

Considering these factors, the final scores are:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The text is generally coherent and well-structured, but its fluency is hindered by complex sentences, awkward phrasing, and a lack of smooth connections between ideas.
