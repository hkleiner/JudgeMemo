The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the main issues with the text in terms of fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text is generally well-constructed in terms of grammatical correctness, but there are some long and convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow of the text.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is formal and academic, which may make it challenging for non-experts to understand. Some words and phrases, such as "transubstantiation" and "consubstantiation," may require additional explanation or context.
* **Phrasing**: The text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which can make it seem stilted or awkward at times.
* **Flow**: The text jumps between different topics and ideas, which can make it difficult to follow. The author assumes a high level of background knowledge and does not provide much context or introduction to the topic.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text is organized into chapters and sections, but the logical flow between ideas is not always clear. The author jumps between different topics and ideas without much transition or explanation.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: The text is repetitive in some areas, with the author reiterating the same points multiple times.
* **Smooth Connections**: The connections between sections and ideas are not always smooth, and the author often uses abrupt transitions.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text assumes a high level of background knowledge and does not provide much explanation or context, which can lead to ambiguity and confusion.
* **Structural Consistency**: The text is structured into chapters and sections, but the author does not consistently follow a clear and logical structure.
