The text provided is a lengthy and detailed description of a region in the United States that the author believes is the location of the Garden of Eden. Here are the main issues with the text in terms of fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* There are numerous instances of repetitive language and ideas, which can make the text feel tedious and difficult to follow.
* The author frequently uses phrases such as "we do say" and "we believe" which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text includes many proper nouns and references to specific locations, events, and people that may be unfamiliar to readers, which can make it hard to understand.
* The author's writing style is often overly descriptive and verbose, with long sentences and paragraphs that can be overwhelming.

**Coherence:**
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, such as the description of the region, the author's personal experiences, and the biblical account of the Garden of Eden.
* The author's argument for why this region is the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly structured or supported by evidence.
* The text includes many tangential comments and asides that disrupt the flow of the argument and make it hard to follow.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Bible, geography, and history, which may not be shared by all readers.
* The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the main points, which can leave the reader feeling unclear about what the author is trying to say.
