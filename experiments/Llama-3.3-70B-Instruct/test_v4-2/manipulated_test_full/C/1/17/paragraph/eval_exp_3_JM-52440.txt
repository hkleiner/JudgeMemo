The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the main issues related to fluency and coherence:

**Fluency:**
* **Syntax and Grammar**: The text is generally well-constructed in terms of grammatical correctness, but there are some long and convoluted sentences that may hinder readability.
* **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow.
* **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is formal and suitable for the context, but some words and phrases may be unfamiliar to non-experts in theology.
* **Phrasing**: Some phrases are awkwardly worded, and the text could benefit from more varied and engaging sentence structures.
* **Flow**: The text jumps between different topics and ideas, which can make it difficult to follow at times.

**Coherence:**
* **Logical Sequencing**: The text could be improved by clearer transitions between paragraphs and a more logical sequencing of ideas.
* **Non-repetitiveness**: Some ideas and points are repeated, which can make the text feel redundant and lengthy.
* **Smooth Connections**: The connections between sections and ideas are not always smooth, and the text could benefit from more explicit links between paragraphs.
* **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text assumes a high level of background knowledge in theology, which can make it difficult for non-experts to understand.
* **Structural Consistency**: The text is generally well-structured, but some sections feel like tangents or digressions.
