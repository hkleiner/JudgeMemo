* There are many complex sentences with multiple clauses, which can disrupt the flow.
* The author frequently uses quotes and references to other texts, which can be distracting.
* The text assumes a high level of familiarity with Dickens's work and the context of the novel, which may not be the case for all readers.
* The writing style is formal and academic, which may not be engaging for all readers.

**Coherence:**
* The text jumps between different topics and ideas, such as the analysis of the novel, the author's intentions, and the various theories about the mystery.
* The author presents multiple theories and interpretations, which can be confusing and make it difficult to follow the main argument.
* The text lacks a clear structure and organization, with some sections feeling like tangents or asides.
* The author's tone can be somewhat sarcastic and dismissive of other theories, which may not be persuasive or respectful to readers who hold different opinions.
