Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "was capture" should be "was captured"
* [GRAMMAR] "woulded" should be "would"
* [LEXICON] "situate" is an uncommon word, "located" would be more suitable
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the war in general to focusing on the specific campaign for Petersburg
* [STRUCTURE] The chapters seem to be somewhat disconnected, with little transition between them
* [CLARITY] Some sections are dense with names and dates, making it difficult to understand the overall narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
