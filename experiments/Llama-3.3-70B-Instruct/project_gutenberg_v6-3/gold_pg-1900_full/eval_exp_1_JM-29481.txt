Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted
* [LEXICON] A few words are archaic or less common in modern English
* [SYNTAX] Occasionally, sentence structure is complex and hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The plot twist with the violin's fifth string and its consequences is somewhat implausible
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different scenes and time periods, which can be disorienting
* [CLARITY] Some character motivations, especially those of Mr. Wallace and old Sanders, are not entirely clear
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
