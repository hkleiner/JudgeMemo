Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Complex sentence structures
* [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary
* [SYNTAX] Long paragraphs with multiple ideas
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between ideas
* [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or headings
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or unclear
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4 
(Note: The original instruction was to provide a score between 1 and 5, with half-points allowed, for both coherence and fluency. However, the provided response only included a whole number for fluency. To adhere strictly to the format and instructions, the fluency score should be explicitly stated as a whole number or a half-point, as initially guided. Given the context, the score of "4" for fluency implies a high level of fluency with minor issues, which aligns with the description provided in the fluency issues section.)
