Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's doctrine to a detailed analysis of sacraments without a clear transitional phrase.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.
* [TRANSITION] The shift from introducing the topic to delving into specific biblical references and theological concepts feels somewhat disconnected.
2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
