Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's doctrine to a detailed analysis of sacraments without a clear transitional phrase.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes the reader is familiar with specific theological concepts and debates without providing sufficient background information.
2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
