* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow.
* [CLARITY] The author's theory and arguments are sometimes hard to understand due to complex sentence structures and vague explanations.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different ideas and theories without smooth transitions, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [LOGIC] Some of the author's conclusions and assumptions seem to be based on incomplete or unclear reasoning.
