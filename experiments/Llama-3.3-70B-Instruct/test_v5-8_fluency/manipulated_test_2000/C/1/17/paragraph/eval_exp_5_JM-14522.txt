1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* [SYNTAX] The text jumps abruptly between different storylines and characters.
* [LEXICON] The use of some words, such as "sanguineous" and "phantasmata", may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers.
* [STRUCTURE] The text combines multiple narrative styles, including horror, comedy, and social commentary, which can be disorienting.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and scenes are sometimes unclear or abrupt.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
