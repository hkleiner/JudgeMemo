1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary, such as "precentor" and "demned", may cause difficulty for some readers.
* [SYNTAX] The text jumps between different narrative styles, including descriptive passages, dialogue, and analytical commentary, which can disrupt the flow.
* [STRUCTURE] The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may make it inaccessible to some readers.
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are dense with information and lack clear topic sentences, making it hard to discern the main point.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
