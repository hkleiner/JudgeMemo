1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them hard to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text includes some outdated or obscure terms, such as "thing" used as a placeholder, which may confuse modern readers.
* [SYNTAX] The narrative jumps between different time periods and ideas, sometimes without clear transitions.
* [CLARITY] A few sentences are ambiguous or unclear, requiring close reading to understand the intended meaning.
* [SPELLING] There are no noticeable spelling errors, but some words may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
