1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] None notable
* [SPELLING] None notable
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and complex, but generally well-structured
* [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary (e.g. "punctilious", "spry", "quaint") may cause difficulty for some readers
* [ANACHRONISM] Inclusion of modern elements (e.g. "hologram", "bluetooth signal", "surveillance camera") in a text set in the past may disrupt fluency
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
