1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (e.g. "had felt it his duty", "would was", "am see", "was removed at once")
* [SPELLING] occasional spelling errors or typos (e.g. "woedn't" instead of "wouldn't")
* [SYNTAX] some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased (e.g. "It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods")
* [LEXICON] some words or phrases may be unfamiliar to modern readers (e.g. "waggonette", "cheroot")
* [TRANSITION] abrupt transitions between scenes or ideas (e.g. between the description of the family's arrival and the introduction of the ghost)
