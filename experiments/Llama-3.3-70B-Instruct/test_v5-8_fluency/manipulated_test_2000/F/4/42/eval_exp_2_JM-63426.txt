1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense usage (e.g., "it shoulded be talked about", "there was always a giantâ€™s spirit", "you was on the 'Narrow Gauge'")
* [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably", "the girls giggle, the boys laugh at the new boy in a too-big suit")
* [SPELLING] Typos and incorrect word usage (e.g., "picklelime", "exquisite backwater" is unclear, "lustly" is not a word)
* [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and lack of punctuation (e.g., "You are six years old; next month you would be seven" should be two separate sentences)
* [LEXICON] Informal language and colloquialisms (e.g., "corn-feed American", "lusty, democratic ambition")
* [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure and length
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
