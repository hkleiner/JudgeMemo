1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] The text contains some grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, and inconsistent verb tenses.
* [SPELLING] There are a few spelling mistakes, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians".
* [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or obscure vocabulary, such as "nugatory" and "Tartarian".
* [STYLE] The writing style is often overly formal and verbose, with excessive use of rhetorical flourishes.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5 

The text is generally readable, but the numerous grammatical, spelling, and syntactical errors, as well as the complex sentence structure and outdated vocabulary, detract from its overall fluency. The writing style, while formal, is often overly elaborate and verbose, which can make it difficult to follow. However, the text is still comprehensible, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.
