1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb tense usage and inconsistent narrative voice
* [SPELLING] Few minor spelling errors, such as "was" instead of "were" in some places
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, disrupting the flow
* [LEXICON] Occasional use of outdated or obscure vocabulary
* [CLARITY] Certain paragraphs lack clear transitions or connections to the preceding text

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0 

The text is generally well-written, but there are noticeable issues with grammar, syntax, and clarity that prevent it from being highly fluent. The narrative voice and verb tense are not consistently maintained, and some sentences are awkwardly phrased. However, the text is still readable and understandable, and the author's experiences and stories are engaging. With some revisions to address these issues, the text could be even more effective and enjoyable to read.
