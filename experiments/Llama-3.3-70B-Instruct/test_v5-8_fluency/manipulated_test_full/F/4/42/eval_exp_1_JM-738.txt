1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text features a wide range of vocabulary, including some archaic and less common words, which may pose a challenge for some readers.
* [SYNTAX] The narrative frequently shifts between different time periods and plot threads, which can be disorienting if not carefully attended to.
* [CLARITY] Certain sections, particularly those involving theoretical discussions of the mystery, can be confusing due to the complexity of the arguments presented.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between different ideas and scenes are sometimes abrupt, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
