1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text includes some archaic vocabulary and complex theological terms that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [SYNTAX] The text features a formal, somewhat antiquated writing style, which can make it challenging to read for those accustomed to more contemporary writing.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother, as the text sometimes feels like a collection of loosely connected sections.
* [CLARITY] Certain passages are unclear or open to multiple interpretations due to the complexity of the subject matter and the writing style.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
