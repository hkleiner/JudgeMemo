1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of missing or unclear antecedents for pronouns, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
* [SPELLING] Some words are replaced with "a thing", "stuff", or other placeholders, indicating potential spelling or formatting issues.
* [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to understand due to their complexity and lack of clarity.
* [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "a thing" and "stuff" instead of specific nouns, which disrupts the flow and clarity of the text.
* [CLARITY] The text jumps between different time periods and ideas without smooth transitions, affecting overall coherence.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
