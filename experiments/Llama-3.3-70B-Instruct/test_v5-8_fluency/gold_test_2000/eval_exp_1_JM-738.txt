1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them hard to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic vocabulary and phrases, such as "hab nab at a venture" and "the first sprightly runnings", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [SYNTAX] The text occasionally uses complex sentence structures, with multiple nested clauses, which can disrupt the flow of reading.
* [STYLE] The writing style is formal and dense, with long paragraphs and detailed descriptions, which can make it difficult to maintain attention.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
