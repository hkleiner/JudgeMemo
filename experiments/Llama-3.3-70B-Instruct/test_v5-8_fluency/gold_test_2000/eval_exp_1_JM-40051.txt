1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic or less common vocabulary, such as "antldiluvians" and "euphony", which may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [SYNTAX] The text occasionally uses awkward or unclear sentence structures, such as the use of multiple clauses without clear connections.
* [SPELLING] There are a few minor spelling errors, such as "acclimate" instead of "accclimate" (although this may be a variant spelling).
* [STYLE] The text has a somewhat formal and old-fashioned tone, which may make it less engaging for some readers.

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
