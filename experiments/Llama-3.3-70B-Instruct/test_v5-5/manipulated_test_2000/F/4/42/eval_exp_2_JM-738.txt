Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb conjugation, such as "he certainly write" instead of "he certainly wrote", "he was conspicuously defunct" is an unusual phrase, and "he am" instead of "he is" or "he was".
* [SPELLING] No major spelling errors, but some words are used in unusual contexts, such as "babblinged" which seems to be a typo or incorrect word choice.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or structured in a way that makes them hard to follow, such as the long sentence starting with "When the story opens".
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or uncommon vocabulary, such as "demned", "gamin", and "precentor", which may make it harder for modern readers to understand.
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and scenes, such as the transition from discussing Dickens's health to describing the characters in the story.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with some sections feeling like a stream-of-consciousness narrative and others feeling more formal and analytical.
* [CLARITY] Some sections of the text are unclear or confusing, such as the description of the relationships between the characters and the plot of the story.
* [TRANSITION] The text often lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs or sections, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.
