Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Several sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain grammatical errors, such as "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," which is nearly incomprehensible.
* [CLARITY] The text often jumps abruptly between different ideas or descriptions without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear, logical structure, with the author veering off into tangents or providing excessive detail about certain aspects of the garden.
* [LEXICON] Some words or phrases are used in ways that seem archaic or overly formal, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not consistently logical or persuasive, relying on vague suggestions and unproven assumptions.
