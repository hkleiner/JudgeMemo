Issues: 
* [ANACHRONISM] - The story contains modern elements like a hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera that are out of place in the time period.
* [LOGIC] - The sudden appearance of a storm and the reaction of the characters to it seems disconnected from the rest of the story.
* [TRANSITION] - The transition between chapters and scenes could be smoother, with some scenes feeling abrupt or disconnected.
* [CLARITY] - Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear descriptions, making it hard to follow the narrative.
* [CONSISTENCY] - The tone of the story sometimes shifts between humorous and serious, which can be jarring.
