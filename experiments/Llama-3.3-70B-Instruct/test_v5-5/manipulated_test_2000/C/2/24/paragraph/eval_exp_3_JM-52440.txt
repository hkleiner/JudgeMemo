Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the Church of England's doctrine to mentioning unrelated topics such as "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" and "The biosensor updated its readout", which disrupts the flow of the argument.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother, with more connecting phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the text.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or convoluted, making them difficult to follow, such as the sentence "That the material food is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality."
* [STRUCTURE] The text could benefit from a clearer structure, with more defined sections or subsections to organize the ideas and make them easier to follow.
