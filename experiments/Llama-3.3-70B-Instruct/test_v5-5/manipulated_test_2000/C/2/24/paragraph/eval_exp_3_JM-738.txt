Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a collection of chapters and sections that seem to be part of a larger analysis or critique of Charles Dickens's last novel, but the transitions between these sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex phrases that may hinder understanding, such as the description of Jasper's character and his relationships with other characters.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Dickens's life and writing style to analyzing specific characters and plot points in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* [LEXICON] The use of some words and phrases, such as "demned outline" and "the first sprightly runnings", may be unfamiliar to modern readers and could be clarified or explained.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some minor grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb tenses, but they do not significantly impact the overall fluency of the text.
