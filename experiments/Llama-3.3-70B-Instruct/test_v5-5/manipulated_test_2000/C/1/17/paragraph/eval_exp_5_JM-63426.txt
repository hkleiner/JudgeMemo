Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story seems to jump abruptly between different time periods and storylines, making it difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are not smooth, and the reader is often left wondering how the different parts of the story are connected.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it hard to understand what the author is trying to say.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb tenses, that detract from the overall fluency of the text.
* [LEXICON] The author uses some words or phrases that are not commonly used in modern English, which can make the text feel dated or confusing.
