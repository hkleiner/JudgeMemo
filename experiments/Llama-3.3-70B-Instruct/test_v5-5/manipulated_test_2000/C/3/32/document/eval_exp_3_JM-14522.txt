Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR]: Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow.
* [SPELLING]: There are no noticeable spelling errors, but some words are outdated or uncommon, which may affect readability.
* [STRUCTURE]: The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the appearance of the ghost, with little transition or buildup.
* [CLARITY]: Some parts of the story are unclear or confusing, such as the conversation between Mr. Otis and the ghost, which may require re-reading to understand.
* [TRANSITION]: The story switches between different scenes and plot points without smooth transitions, which can be disorienting for the reader.
* [LEXICON]: The use of words like "waggonette", "cheroot", and "gyves" may be unfamiliar to some readers and require explanation or context.
