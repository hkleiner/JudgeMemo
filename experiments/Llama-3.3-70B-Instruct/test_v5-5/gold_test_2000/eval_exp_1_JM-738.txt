Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and contains many characters, plot points, and historical references, which can make it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them hard to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly between different scenes and characters, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and vocabulary may be unfamiliar to some readers, potentially causing confusion.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some long, complex sentences that may be grammatically correct but are still difficult to parse.
