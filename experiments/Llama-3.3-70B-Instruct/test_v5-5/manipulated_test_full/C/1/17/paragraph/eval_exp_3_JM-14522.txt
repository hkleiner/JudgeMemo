* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and scenes are sometimes abrupt, making it difficult to follow the story.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb tenses.
* [LEXICON] The vocabulary is mostly formal and suitable for the story's tone, but some words or phrases may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
