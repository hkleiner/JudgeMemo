* [CLARITY] Some sections are unclear or confusing, particularly when the author is discussing technical aspects of printing and design.
* [LEXICON] The use of technical terms and jargon related to printing and design may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors and awkwardly phrased sentences throughout the text.
