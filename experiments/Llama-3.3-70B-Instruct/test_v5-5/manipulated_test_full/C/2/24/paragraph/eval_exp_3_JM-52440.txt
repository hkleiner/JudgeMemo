Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text contains some abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs, which can make it difficult to follow.
* [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and dense, with some paragraphs extending for several pages, which can make it hard to maintain a clear structure.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex vocabulary, which can impede understanding.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to adoration and sacrifice, without clear connections between the topics.
* [LEXICON] The use of specialized theological terminology may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers.
