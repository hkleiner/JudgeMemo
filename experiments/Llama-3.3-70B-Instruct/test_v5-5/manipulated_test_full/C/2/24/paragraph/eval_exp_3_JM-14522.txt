* [CLARITY]: Some of the language and descriptions are overly complex and may be hard for readers to understand.
* [LEXICON]: The use of outdated vocabulary and phrases, such as "thou" and "thee", may be confusing for modern readers.
* [LOGIC]: The plot relies heavily on supernatural elements, which may not be believable or engaging for all readers.
