FINAL Coherence Score: 4
The story has a clear overall structure, with a mystery to be solved and a cast of characters with their own motivations and backstories. However, the complexity of the plot and the large number of characters can make it difficult to follow at times. The author provides some clues and hints throughout the story, but some parts remain unclear or ambiguous.

FINAL Fluency Score: 4
The writing is generally fluent, with a good command of language and vocabulary. However, there are some errors in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. The author's use of archaic language and vocabulary can also make the text less accessible to some readers. Overall, the writing is engaging and effective in conveying the story, but could benefit from some refinement to improve clarity and precision.
