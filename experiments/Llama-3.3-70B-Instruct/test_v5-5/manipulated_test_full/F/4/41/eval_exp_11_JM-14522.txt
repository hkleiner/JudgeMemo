Issues: 
* [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors throughout the text, such as "biught" instead of "bought", "wyen" instead of "when", "xnd" instead of "and", etc.
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are grammatically incorrect or awkwardly phrased, such as "After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition" which could be rephrased for better clarity.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or obscure vocabulary, such as "spry", "phrased", and "tincture", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into chapters, but the transitions between them could be smoother, and some chapters feel disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
* [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are unclear or confusing, such as the ghost's motivations and actions, which may require closer reading to understand.
