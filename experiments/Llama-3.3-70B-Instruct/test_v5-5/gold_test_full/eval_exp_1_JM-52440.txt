Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text assumes a high level of familiarity with theological terminology and concepts, which may make it inaccessible to non-expert readers.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to discussing adoration and sacrifice, without clear connections between the topics.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some minor errors in punctuation and sentence structure, but they do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the text.
