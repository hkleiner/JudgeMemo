Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [SPELLING] numerous typos and spelling errors (e.g., "seem" instead of "seen", "toom" instead of "room", "wre" instead of "were", "cemts" instead of "cents", etc.)
* [GRAMMAR] occasional grammatical errors (e.g., "You are six years old; next month you will be seven" could be rephrased for better clarity)
* [SYNTAX] some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased (e.g., "It is your second year in school. You now have a step-father. He is a fine man and you like him and he likes you--but of course you canâ€™t expect him to pay for your art esucation.")
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] the text jumps abruptly between different time periods and topics (e.g., the transition from discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to describing his childhood)
* [CLARITY] some sections are unclear or difficult to follow due to vague or ambiguous language (e.g., the description of the printing press and the process of feeding it)
* [TRANSITION] the text could benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs and sections
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
