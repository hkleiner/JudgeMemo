Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and dense, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain complex theological concepts that may be hard for non-experts to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between chapters and ideas could be smoother, with more explicit connections between paragraphs.
* [LEXICON] The use of specialized vocabulary and theological jargon may limit the text's accessibility to a broader audience.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some long, convoluted sentences that could be broken up for easier reading.
