Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE]: The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the appearance of the ghost, with little transition or build-up.
* [CLARITY]: Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION]: The shift from Chapter I to Chapter II feels disjointed, with little connection between the two chapters.
* [LEXICON]: The use of some words, such as "sanguineous" and "phantasmata", may be unfamiliar to some readers and disrupt the flow of the text.
* [GRAMMAR]: There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure, such as the use of multiple clauses in a single sentence.
