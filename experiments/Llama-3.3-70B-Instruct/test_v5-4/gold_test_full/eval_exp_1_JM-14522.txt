Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into chapters, but the transitions between them could be smoother, and some chapters feel disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
* [CLARITY] A few sections of the story are unclear or confusing, particularly when the ghost is explaining his backstory and motivations.
* [TRANSITION] The shift in tone from humorous to serious in some parts of the story can be jarring, and the pacing could be improved to create a more cohesive narrative.
* [LEXICON] Some of the language and vocabulary used in the story may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which could affect their understanding and engagement with the narrative.
* [LOGIC] The story relies on some convenient plot devices, such as the ghost's ability to manipulate the physical world and the family's willingness to accept the supernatural events, which could be seen as implausible or unexplained.
