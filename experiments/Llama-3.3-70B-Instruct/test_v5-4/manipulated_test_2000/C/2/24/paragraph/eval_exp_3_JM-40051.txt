Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [CLARITY] The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and descriptions, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are sometimes unclear or missing.
* [LEXICON] The use of some words and phrases, such as "veritable Garden of Eden" and "beau ideal of a garden", may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [STRUCTURE] The text could benefit from a clearer and more logical structure, with a more defined introduction, body, and conclusion.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward or unusual syntax, which can make them hard to understand.
