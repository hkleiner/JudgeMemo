Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a mix of analysis, critique, and summary of Dickens's last plot, which can make it hard to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them difficult to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Dickens's life and writing style to analyzing the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and terms, such as "hab nab at a venture" and "roman policier", may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of comma splices and run-on sentences.
