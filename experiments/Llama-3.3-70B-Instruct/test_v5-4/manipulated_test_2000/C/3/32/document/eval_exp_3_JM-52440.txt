Issues: 
* [CLARITY] The text is often wordy and contains long, convoluted sentences that can make it difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother, as the text sometimes jumps abruptly from one topic to another.
* [LEXICON] Some of the language and terminology used may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers, which could hinder understanding.
* [STRUCTURE] The text could benefit from a clearer and more concise structure, as it sometimes feels meandering and repetitive.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, and awkward phrasing.
