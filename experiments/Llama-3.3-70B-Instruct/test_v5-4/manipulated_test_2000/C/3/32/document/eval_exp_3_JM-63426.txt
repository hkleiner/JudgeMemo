Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow.
* [SPELLING] There are instances of missing or unclear words, such as "a thing" and "stuff", which seem to be placeholders or errors.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly between different time periods and events, making it difficult to follow the chronology of Will Bradley's life.
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are dense and lack clear transitions, causing the reader to struggle to understand the connections between ideas.
* [LEXICON] The text includes some archaic or obscure terms, such as "picklelime" and "Ingersoll dollar watch", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The story sometimes relies on convenient coincidences or unexplained events, which can feel implausible or confusing.
