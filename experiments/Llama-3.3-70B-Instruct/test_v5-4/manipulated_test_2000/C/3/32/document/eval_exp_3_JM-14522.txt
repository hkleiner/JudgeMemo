Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR]: Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow.
* [SPELLING]: There are no noticeable spelling errors, but some words are outdated or uncommon, which may affect readability.
* [STRUCTURE]: The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the appearance of the ghost, with little transition or buildup.
* [CLARITY]: Some sections of the story are unclear or confusing, such as the conversation about the bloodstain and the ghost's appearance.
* [TRANSITION]: The story could benefit from smoother transitions between scenes and chapters, to improve the overall flow and coherence.
* [LEXICON]: The use of some words and phrases, such as "a thing" and "a stuff", is unclear and may be intended as placeholders, but disrupts the flow of the story.
