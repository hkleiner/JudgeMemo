Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Several sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain grammatical errors, such as "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," which is nearly incomprehensible.
* [CLARITY] The text often jumps abruptly between different ideas or descriptions without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear, logical structure, with the author veering off into tangents or providing excessive detail about certain aspects of the garden while glossing over others.
* [LEXICON] The use of language is sometimes overly elaborate or poetic, which, while occasionally beautiful, can also obscure the author's meaning or make the text feel overly florid.
* [LOGIC] Some of the author's arguments or conclusions feel unsupported or lack logical coherence, such as the connection made between the garden's location and its supposed status as the Garden of Eden.
