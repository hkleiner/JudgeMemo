Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of incorrect verb conjugation, such as "he certainly write" instead of "he certainly wrote", "he was conspicuously defunct" is an unusual phrase, and "he am" instead of "he is" or "he was".
* [SPELLING] No major spelling errors, but some words are used in unusual contexts or with unclear meanings, such as "babblinged" and "opiumed".
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, making them hard to follow, such as the sentence describing Jasper's vision.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or obscure vocabulary, such as "demned", "gamin", and "precentor", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly between different scenes and ideas, making it hard to follow the plot.
* [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters and sections, but the transitions between them are not always smooth.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or ambiguous, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The text sometimes switches between different topics or scenes without clear transitions, making it hard to follow.
