Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to adoration and sacrifice without a clear connection.
* [LEXICON] The use of theological terminology may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers, which could hinder understanding.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some minor grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb tenses.
