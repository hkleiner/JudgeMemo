Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and meandering, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.
* [CLARITY] The author's writing style is often unclear and confusing, with long sentences and unclear transitions between ideas.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the description of the garden and the discussion of geological age.
* [LEXICON] The author uses overly complex vocabulary and poetic language, which can be alienating to some readers.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument is not well-supported by evidence and relies heavily on biblical interpretation and personal opinion.
