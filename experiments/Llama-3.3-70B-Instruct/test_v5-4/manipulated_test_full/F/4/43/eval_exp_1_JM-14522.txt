* [TRANSITION] The transition between some chapters and scenes can be abrupt, disrupting the flow of the story.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of incorrect verb tense usage and missing articles.
* [LEXICON] The vocabulary is mostly formal and old-fashioned, which may not be familiar to all readers.
