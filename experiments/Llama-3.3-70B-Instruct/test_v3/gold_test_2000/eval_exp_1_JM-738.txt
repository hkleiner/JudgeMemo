After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow. The language is formal and complex, with long sentences and intricate sentence structures.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Charles Dickens, his works, and the historical context in which he wrote. This may make it challenging for readers who are not familiar with Dickens or his era to understand the text.
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. For example, the text switches from discussing Dickens's writing style to analyzing the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" without a clear transition.
* The text includes many references to other works, authors, and historical figures, which can be distracting and make the text feel disjointed.
* Some sentences are wordy or contain unnecessary phrases, which can make them hard to follow. For example, the sentence "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" could be simplified for better clarity.
* The text includes many proper nouns, such as character names and locations, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the story.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic and sets up the context for the analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The text also includes many insightful comments and observations about Dickens's writing style and the plot of the novel.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, despite some abrupt transitions and digressions. The fluency score is lower because the text is written in a complex and formal style, which can make it challenging for readers to follow. Additionally, the text includes many references and proper nouns that can be distracting and disrupt the flow of the narrative.
