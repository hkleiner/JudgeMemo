After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is quite lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow at times.
* There are numerous complex sentences with multiple clauses, which can lead to confusion.
* The author frequently uses transitional phrases and words, such as "thus," "therefore," and "in other words," which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and theological concepts, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The author's tone is formal and somewhat archaic, which may make the text less accessible to modern readers.
* There are some repetitive phrases and ideas, such as the distinction between the "visible sign" and the "invisible gift," which are repeated multiple times.
* The text could benefit from more concise and clear summaries of the main points, as well as more explicit connections between the different sections.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and coherent, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic, sets out the main points of contention, and proceeds to examine the relevant documents and teachings of the Church of England.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, despite some complexities and assumptions about background knowledge. The fluency score is lower due to the dense and formal writing style, which can make the text challenging to read and understand at times.
