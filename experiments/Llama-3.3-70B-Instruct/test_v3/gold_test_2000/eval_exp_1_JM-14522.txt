After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is quite long and dense, which can make it difficult to follow at times. This is particularly true for readers who are not familiar with the writing style of the late 19th century.
* Some sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can disrupt the flow of the text. For example, the sentence "Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language" could be broken up for easier reading.
* The text assumes a certain level of cultural knowledge, particularly with regards to American and British culture of the time period. This may make it difficult for some readers to fully understand the context and references.
* The story jumps abruptly from a discussion of the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to a detailed description of the house and its history. This transition could be smoother.
* The character of Mrs. Umney is introduced somewhat abruptly, and her role in the story is not immediately clear.
* The tone of the story can be somewhat inconsistent, veering wildly from humor to horror.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and engaging. The author's use of language is vivid and evocative, and the story is well-structured and easy to follow.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

The coherence score is high because the story is generally well-organized and easy to follow, despite some abrupt transitions and assumptions of cultural knowledge. The fluency score is also high because the text is well-written and engaging, with vivid language and a clear structure. However, the score is not perfect due to some issues with sentence length and complexity, as well as the assumption of cultural knowledge.
