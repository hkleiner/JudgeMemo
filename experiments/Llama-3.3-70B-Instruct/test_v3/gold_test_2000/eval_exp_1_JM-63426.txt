After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is written in a somewhat old-fashioned style, which may make it less accessible to modern readers.
* There are some long, convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow.
* The narrative jumps back and forth between different time periods and locations, which can be disorienting.
* Some of the paragraphs are quite long and could be broken up for easier reading.
* The text assumes a certain level of background knowledge about the time period and the subject's life, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* There are some awkward transitions between paragraphs and sections.
* The use of colloquial expressions and slang (e.g. "picklelime") may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* The text includes some tangential details that may not be essential to the main narrative.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and engaging, with a clear passion for the subject matter.
