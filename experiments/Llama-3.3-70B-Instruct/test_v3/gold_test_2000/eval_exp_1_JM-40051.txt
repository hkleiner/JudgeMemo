After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* The author frequently uses long, winding sentences that can be difficult to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text includes numerous tangents and asides, such as the discussion of the names of the cities of La Crosse and Winona, that can make it hard to follow the main argument.
* The author assumes a high level of familiarity with biblical references and geographical locations, which may not be shared by all readers.
* The text includes some awkward phrasing and word choices, such as the use of the phrase "veritable Garden of Eden" and the description of the scenery as "surpassing my power of adequate description".
* The author's tone can be somewhat inconsistent, veering between a formal, academic tone and a more conversational, enthusiastic tone.
* The text includes some repetitive language and ideas, such as the repeated references to the beauty of the scenery and the significance of the location.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and a logical flow of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic and sets out a clear argument, and the text includes some effective uses of rhetorical devices, such as metaphor and allusion.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and a logical flow of ideas. The fluency score is lower because of the issues with sentence structure, vocabulary, and tone, which can make the text difficult to read and understand.
