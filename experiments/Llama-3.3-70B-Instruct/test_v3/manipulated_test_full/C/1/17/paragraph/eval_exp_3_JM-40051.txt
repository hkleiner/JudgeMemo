After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency:**

* The text is overly long and meandering, making it difficult to follow.
* There are numerous tangents and digressions that disrupt the flow of the text.
* The writing style is often verbose and uses complex sentence structures, which can be hard to understand.
* The text includes many repetitive phrases and ideas, such as the repeated invitations to "come and see" the Garden of Eden.
* The use of poetic language and metaphors, while sometimes beautiful, can be confusing and obscure the main points.
* The text includes several abrupt transitions between ideas and topics.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, making it difficult to understand the author's main argument or point.
* The author jumps between different topics, such as the location of the Garden of Eden, the beauty of the scenery, and the history of the region, without clear connections between them.
* The text includes many unsupported claims and assertions, such as the idea that the Garden of Eden is located in Wisconsin, without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning.
* The author uses biblical references and quotes, but often takes them out of context or interprets them in a way that is not clear or convincing.
* The text includes several contradictory ideas and statements, such as the claim that the region is exempt from cyclones, but also mentions that storms can occur.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, making it challenging to follow and understand the author's main points and arguments. While there are some beautiful and evocative passages, the text as a whole is marred by its meandering structure, verbose language, and lack of clear connections between ideas.
