The given text is "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. After carefully reading the story, I have identified some issues that affected my ratings:

Issues affecting fluency:
* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are some long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to understand.
* The story includes some obscure references and allusions that may not be familiar to all readers.
* The text sometimes jumps abruptly from one scene or idea to another, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.

Issues affecting coherence:
* The story has a clear overall structure, but some of the individual chapters or sections feel a bit disjointed or disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
* The character motivations and actions are not always clearly explained or consistent, which can make it hard to follow the plot.
* The story includes some supernatural elements that are not fully explained or resolved, which can be confusing for readers.
* The tone of the story sometimes shifts abruptly, veering from humorous to serious to sentimental.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and engaging, with a clear and consistent narrative voice.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
