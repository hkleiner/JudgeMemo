After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affect the quality of the text:

**Fluency Issues:**

* The text is written in a mix of first-person and second-person narrative styles, which can be confusing for the reader.
* There are abrupt transitions between chapters and sections, making it difficult to follow the flow of the story.
* Some sentences are long and convoluted, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the rhythm of the text.
* The text includes many dates, names, and technical terms related to printing and design, which can be overwhelming for non-experts.
* There are some inconsistencies in formatting, such as the use of different font styles and sizes.

**Coherence Issues:**

* The text jumps back and forth between different time periods and events, making it challenging to understand the chronology of the story.
* Some sections seem to be disconnected from the rest of the narrative, such as the descriptions of historical events or technical details about printing.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the printing industry, design, and art history, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The author's tone and voice are not consistent throughout the text, ranging from formal to informal and from serious to humorous.
* The text includes many tangential comments and asides, which can distract from the main narrative.

Considering these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The text has some significant coherence and fluency issues, but it is still possible to follow the general narrative and appreciate the author's experiences and insights. However, the text could benefit from editing and revision to improve its clarity, consistency, and overall flow.
