After carefully reading the text, I have identified the following issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

* The text is quite lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow at times.
* There are abrupt transitions between different topics and ideas, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text includes numerous quotes and references to external sources, which can make it difficult to understand the author's main points.
* Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them hard to decipher.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its history, and its doctrines, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The author's tone can be somewhat confrontational and defensive, which may detract from the overall clarity and persuasiveness of the text.
* The text includes some unrelated passages and anecdotes (e.g., the story about George Stransom and the description of Millet's painting "The Sower") that seem out of place and disrupt the coherence of the text.
* The author's use of rhetorical questions and exclamations can come across as overly dramatic and may not contribute to the text's overall clarity.

Regarding coherence, the text's main argument and structure are generally clear, but the numerous digressions and tangents can make it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. The text could benefit from a clearer and more concise introduction to the topic, as well as more explicit connections between the different sections and ideas.

Regarding fluency, the text's sentence structure and grammar are generally sound, but the writing style is often formal and dense, which can make it challenging to read. The text could benefit from more varied and engaging sentence structures, as well as more precise and concise language.
