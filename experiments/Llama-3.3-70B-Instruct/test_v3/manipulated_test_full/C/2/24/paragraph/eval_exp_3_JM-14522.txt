The given text is a story titled "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. After carefully reading the story, I have identified some issues that affected my ratings:

Issues affecting fluency:
* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are some long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to understand.
* The story includes some words and phrases that are no longer commonly used, such as "wainscoting," "Saroni photographs," and "arquebuse."
* The text includes some anachronistic elements, such as the mention of "Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent" and "Doctor Dobell's tincture," which may disrupt the flow of the story.

Issues affecting coherence:
* The story jumps abruptly from one scene to another, which can make it difficult to follow.
* Some characters, such as the twins, are not well-developed and seem to appear and disappear at random.
* The story includes some plot threads that are not fully resolved, such as the fate of the gipsies and the reason for the ghost's haunting.
* The story's tone can be inconsistent, veering wildly from humor to pathos to horror.

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-written and engaging, with a clear narrative arc and well-developed main characters.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
