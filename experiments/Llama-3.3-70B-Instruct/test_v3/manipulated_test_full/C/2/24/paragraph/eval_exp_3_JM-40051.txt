After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency:**

* The text is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow.
* The writing style is often verbose, with long sentences and paragraphs that contain multiple ideas.
* There are numerous tangents and digressions that disrupt the flow of the text.
* The author uses complex vocabulary and poetic language, which can be confusing for some readers.
* The text lacks clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas.
* There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear structure and organization, making it hard to understand the author's main argument.
* The author jumps between different topics, such as the location of the Garden of Eden, the geography of the region, and the author's personal experiences, without clear connections between them.
* The text relies heavily on assumptions and unsubstantiated claims, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the topic.
* The author uses biblical references and quotes without providing context or explanation, which can be alienating for non-religious readers.
* The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the main points, leaving the reader feeling unclear about the author's main argument.

Considering these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text scores low on both coherence and fluency due to its disorganized structure, verbose writing style, and lack of clear connections between ideas. While the author shows some creativity and passion for the topic, the text requires significant revision to make it more readable and understandable for a wider audience.
