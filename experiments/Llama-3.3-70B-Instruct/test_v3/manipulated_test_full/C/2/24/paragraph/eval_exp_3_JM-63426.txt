The given text is a biography of Will Bradley, an American artist and typographer. The story is written in a narrative style, with the author recounting Bradley's life events, experiences, and achievements. 

Here are the issues that affected the ratings:

* The text is quite long and dense, making it challenging to follow at times. The narrative jumps back and forth between different periods of Bradley's life, which can be disorienting.
* There are many proper nouns, names, and dates mentioned throughout the text, which can be overwhelming and difficult to keep track of.
* The writing style is often descriptive and detailed, but sometimes it feels overly elaborate or flowery, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The text includes many tangential comments, asides, and anecdotes that, while interesting, can distract from the main story and make it harder to follow.
* The use of transitional phrases and sentences is sometimes lacking, which can make the text feel disjointed or abrupt.
* The text assumes a significant amount of background knowledge about the time period, the art world, and the printing industry, which can make it difficult for readers without this knowledge to fully understand the context and significance of certain events or references.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written, and the author's passion for the subject matter is evident throughout.
