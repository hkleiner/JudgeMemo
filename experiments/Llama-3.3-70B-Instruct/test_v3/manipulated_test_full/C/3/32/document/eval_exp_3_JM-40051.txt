After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

* The text is overly long and repetitive, with many sentences and paragraphs that seem to convey the same information.
* The writing style is often verbose and uses complex sentence structures, making it difficult to follow.
* There are many instances of awkward phrasing, such as the use of multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow of the sentence.
* The text includes numerous proper nouns and technical terms (e.g., geological and biblical references) that may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers.
* The author's tone is sometimes overly enthusiastic and promotional, which can be off-putting to readers.

**Coherence Issues:**

* The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the author's personal experiences, biblical references, and geological descriptions.
* The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly structured, and the evidence presented is often anecdotal or speculative.
* The text includes many tangential comments and asides that disrupt the flow of the argument.
* The author's use of transitions and connecting words is often unclear, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the text.
* The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the main points, leaving the reader with a sense of confusion.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, making it a challenging read for most audiences. While the author is clearly passionate about the topic, the writing style and structure need significant improvement to effectively communicate the ideas and arguments.
