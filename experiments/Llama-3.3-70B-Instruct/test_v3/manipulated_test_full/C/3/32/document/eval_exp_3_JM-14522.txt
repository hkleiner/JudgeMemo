After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is quite long and dense, with long paragraphs and sentences that can be difficult to follow.
* The language and style are somewhat archaic, which may make it challenging for modern readers to understand.
* The story jumps back and forth between different plot threads and characters, which can be confusing at times.
* Some of the dialogue and character interactions feel a bit forced or unnatural.
* The pacing of the story is somewhat uneven, with some sections feeling rushed and others feeling slow.
* The text includes some words and phrases that are no longer commonly used, such as "thou" and "thee", which can disrupt the flow of reading.
* The story relies heavily on descriptive language, which can be beautiful but also overwhelming at times.

Despite these issues, the story has a clear and engaging narrative, with well-developed characters and a unique plot. The author's use of language is often clever and humorous, and the story has a clear structure and resolution.

The main issues affecting coherence are:
* The story's non-linear structure and multiple plot threads can make it difficult to follow at times.
* The character motivations and actions are not always clear or consistent.
* The story's themes and symbolism are not always explicitly stated, which can make it challenging to understand the author's intended meaning.

The main issues affecting fluency are:
* The text's dense and archaic language can make it difficult to read and understand.
* The long paragraphs and sentences can be overwhelming and disrupt the flow of reading.
* The story's pacing is sometimes uneven, which can make it feel slow or rushed in certain sections.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
