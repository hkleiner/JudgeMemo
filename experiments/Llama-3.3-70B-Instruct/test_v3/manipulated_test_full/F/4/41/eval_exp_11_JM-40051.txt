After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency:**

* The text is overly long and meandering, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* The writing style is often verbose, with long sentences and paragraphs that contain multiple, unrelated ideas.
* There are numerous grammatical errors, including missing or incorrect punctuation, verb tense inconsistencies, and incorrect word choices.
* The text includes many tangential comments and asides, which disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The author's tone is often informal and conversational, which can make the text feel less polished and less engaging.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to understand the author's main argument or point.
* The author jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the location of the Garden of Eden, the geography of the region, and the author's personal experiences.
* The text includes many unsupported claims and assertions, which are not backed up by evidence or logical reasoning.
* The author's use of biblical references and quotes is often unclear and confusing, and does not always support the author's argument.
* The text includes many repetitive statements and ideas, which do not add to the overall coherence or clarity of the narrative.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, making it a challenging and frustrating read. While the author is clearly passionate about their topic, their writing style and organizational approach hinder the effectiveness of their argument and the overall readability of the text.
