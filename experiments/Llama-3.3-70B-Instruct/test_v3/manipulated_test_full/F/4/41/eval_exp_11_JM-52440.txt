The text provided is a lengthy and complex theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence:

**Issues affecting fluency:**

* The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which can make it difficult to follow for modern readers.
* The sentences are often long and convoluted, with multiple clauses and phrases that can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The author frequently uses complex theological terminology and concepts, which can be challenging for non-experts to understand.
* There are numerous quotes and references to other texts, which can interrupt the flow of the argument and make it harder to follow.
* The text could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs.

**Issues affecting coherence:**

* The text jumps between different topics and ideas, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation, the role of the Church of England, and the concept of sacrifice, which can make it difficult to follow the author's argument.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about theological concepts and the history of the Church of England, which can make it challenging for readers without this knowledge to understand the text.
* The text could benefit from a clearer structure and organization, with more explicit headings and summaries to help guide the reader through the argument.
* Some of the paragraphs are very long and could be broken up to improve the clarity and coherence of the text.
* The author's tone can be somewhat confrontational and defensive, which may detract from the overall coherence and persuasiveness of the argument.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
The text is generally well-organized and coherent, with a clear argument and structure. However, the complexity of the subject matter, the assumption of background knowledge, and the lack of clear headings and summaries can make it challenging for readers to follow.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
The text is written in a formal and complex style, with long sentences and convoluted phrases that can disrupt the flow of the text. While the author's use of language is generally clear and precise, the text could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs, as well as more attention to sentence-level clarity and concision.
