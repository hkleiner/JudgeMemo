After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is quite long and dense, with long paragraphs and sentences that can be difficult to follow at times.
* There are some awkward phrasings and word choices, such as the use of overly formal language and outdated expressions (e.g., "thou", "thee", "verily").
* The story jumps abruptly between different scenes and plot points, which can make it hard to keep track of the narrative.
* Some of the characters' motivations and actions are not fully explained or seem inconsistent (e.g., the ghost's sudden change of heart, Virginia's decision to help the ghost).
* The text includes some anachronistic elements, such as the mention of modern concepts (e.g., "Republican simplicity", "Democrat") in a story set in the 19th century.
* The pacing of the story is sometimes uneven, with long stretches of descriptive text followed by rapid plot developments.
* The dialogue can feel stilted or overly formal at times, which may detract from the overall fluency of the text.

Despite these issues, the story has a clear and engaging narrative, with well-developed characters and a unique blend of humor, horror, and romance. The author's use of language is often vivid and evocative, and the story's themes of love, death, and redemption are well-explored.
