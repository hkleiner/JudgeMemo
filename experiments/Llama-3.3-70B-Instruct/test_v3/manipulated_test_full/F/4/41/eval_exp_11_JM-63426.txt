After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

**Fluency:**

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with long sentences and complex sentence structures that can make it difficult to follow.
* There are numerous typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies in formatting, which disrupt the flow of the text.
* The use of outdated terminology and slang (e.g., "Gay Nineties") may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* The text includes many proper nouns, which can be confusing without proper context.
* The narrative jumps abruptly between different time periods and topics, making it challenging to maintain a clear understanding of the story.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear narrative thread, with events and anecdotes presented in a non-chronological order.
* The author frequently digresses from the main topic, making it difficult to discern the central theme or message.
* The text includes many names and references that are not fully explained or contextualized, which can confuse readers who are not familiar with the subject matter.
* The author's use of first-person and second-person narration can be disorienting, as it is not always clear who is being addressed or what perspective is being presented.
* The text includes many tangential details and anecdotes that, while interesting, do not contribute significantly to the overall narrative or theme.

Considering these issues, I assign the following scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The text's coherence is compromised by its non-linear narrative, lack of clear context, and numerous digressions. The fluency is also affected by the archaic style, typos, and formatting errors, which can make the text difficult to read and understand. However, the text still conveys a sense of the author's personality and experiences, and the content is engaging and informative, which prevents the scores from being lower.
