After carefully reading the story, I have identified some issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is quite long and dense, which can make it difficult to follow at times. The author's writing style is often descriptive and elaborate, which can lead to lengthy sentences and paragraphs.
* There are some abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. For example, the story jumps suddenly from the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the ghost's backstory without much connection between the two.
* The text includes some archaic language and phrases, such as "thou" and "thee", which can be confusing for modern readers and disrupt the fluency of the text.
* The story has a large cast of characters, which can make it difficult to keep track of who's who and what's happening. Some characters, such as the twins, are not well-developed and feel more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out people.
* The pacing of the story is sometimes uneven, with long stretches of descriptive text followed by quick, action-packed scenes. This can make it difficult to become fully engaged in the narrative.
* The text includes some inconsistencies and plot holes, such as the ghost's ability to interact with the physical world in some scenes but not others.

Despite these issues, the story has a clear and engaging narrative arc, and the author's use of descriptive language can be effective in creating a spooky and atmospheric setting.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
