After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

**Fluency:**

* The text is often written in a conversational tone, which can make it difficult to follow at times.
* There are many long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to parse.
* The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and topics, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* Some sentences are wordy or contain unnecessary phrases, which can slow down the reader.
* The text includes many proper nouns and technical terms (e.g., names of people, places, and printing techniques) that may be unfamiliar to non-experts.

**Coherence:**

* The text is largely autobiographical, but it lacks a clear narrative structure or overarching theme.
* The author jumps back and forth between different periods of his life, which can make it hard to follow the chronology of events.
* Some sections of the text seem to be tangential or unrelated to the main narrative.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the printing industry and its history, which can make it difficult for non-experts to understand the context.
* The text includes many names and references that are not fully explained or contextualized.

Despite these issues, the text is still engaging and provides valuable insights into the life and work of Will Bradley.
