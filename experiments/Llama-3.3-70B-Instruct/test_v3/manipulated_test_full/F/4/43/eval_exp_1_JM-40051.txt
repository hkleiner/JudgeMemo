After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency:**

* The text is overly long and meandering, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* The writing style is often verbose, with long, convoluted sentences that contain multiple clauses and phrases.
* The text includes numerous tangents and asides, which disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The author frequently uses complex vocabulary and poetic language, which can be confusing or alienating to some readers.
* The text lacks clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it hard to understand the relationships between different sections.
* The author's tone is sometimes inconsistent, veering between formal and informal, and between serious and playful.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear structure or organization, making it difficult to understand the author's main argument or point.
* The author jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the location of the Garden of Eden, the geology of the region, and the author's personal experiences.
* The text includes numerous references to external sources, such as the Bible and scientific authorities, which are not always clearly explained or integrated into the narrative.
* The author's use of rhetorical questions and exclamations can be confusing or overwhelming, and disrupts the flow of the text.
* The text includes some contradictory or unclear statements, such as the author's claims about the geological age of the region and the presence of certain rock formations.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, due to its meandering structure, verbose language, and lack of clear transitions and organization. While the author shows some flashes of eloquence and creativity, the text as a whole is difficult to follow and understand.
