The given text is a story titled "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. After carefully reading the story, I have identified some issues that affected my ratings:

Issues affecting fluency:
* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are some long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to understand.
* The author uses complex vocabulary and phrases, which may slow down the reading process.
* The story is divided into chapters, but there are no clear transitions between them, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.

Issues affecting coherence:
* The story has a clear structure, with a well-defined beginning, middle, and end.
* The characters are well-developed and consistent in their actions and dialogue.
* However, the plot relies heavily on supernatural elements, which may be confusing for some readers.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written, and the author's use of language is engaging and descriptive.
