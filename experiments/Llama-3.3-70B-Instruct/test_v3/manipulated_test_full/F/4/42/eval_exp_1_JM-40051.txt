After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency:**

* The text is overly long and meandering, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* The writing style is often verbose, with long sentences and paragraphs that contain multiple, unrelated ideas.
* The text includes numerous tangents and asides, which disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The author frequently uses complex, poetic language that may be difficult for some readers to understand.
* There are several instances of repetitive language and ideas, which can make the text feel redundant and tedious.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear, overarching structure or organization, making it challenging to understand the author's main argument or point.
* The author jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the location of the Garden of Eden, the geography of the region, and the author's personal experiences.
* The text includes numerous references to external sources, such as the Bible and other books, without providing sufficient context or explanation.
* The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences is often awkward or unclear, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the text.
* The text includes several contradictions and inconsistencies, such as the author's claim that the Garden of Eden is both a specific, physical location and a symbolic or metaphorical concept.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, making it a challenging and frustrating read. While the author is clearly passionate about their subject matter, their writing style and organizational approach hinder the text's overall effectiveness.
