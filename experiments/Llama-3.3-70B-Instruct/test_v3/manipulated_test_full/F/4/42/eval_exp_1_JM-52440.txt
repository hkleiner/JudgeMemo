The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author examines the Church's documents, including the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies, to ascertain the Church's teaching on the subject.

Issues affecting the fluency score:
* The text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge of theological concepts and Church history, which may make the text inaccessible to some readers.
* The text is densely packed with quotes and references to various Church documents, which can disrupt the flow of the argument.
* The author's writing style is often repetitive, with similar points being made multiple times in different ways.
* The text lacks clear headings and subheadings, making it difficult to navigate and follow the author's argument.

Issues affecting the coherence score:
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the practice of adoration.
* The author's argument is not always clearly structured, with some points being introduced without clear explanation or connection to the rest of the text.
* The text relies heavily on quotes and references to Church documents, which can make it difficult to follow the author's own argument and conclusions.
* The author's use of technical theological terms and concepts can make the text difficult to understand for readers without a strong background in theology.
* The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the author's main points, making it difficult to discern the overall argument and takeaways.

Despite these issues, the text is well-researched and demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter. The author's passion and conviction are evident throughout the text, and the use of quotes and references adds depth and authority to the argument.
