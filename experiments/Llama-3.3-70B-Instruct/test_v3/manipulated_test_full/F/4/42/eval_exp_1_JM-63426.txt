After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

**Fluency:**

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with long sentences and complex sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow at times.
* There are some awkward phrasings and word choices, such as the use of "whilom" and "thou", which may not be familiar to modern readers.
* The text includes many proper nouns, such as names of people, places, and publications, which can be overwhelming and disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The author often uses parenthetical remarks and asides, which can interrupt the flow of the text and make it harder to follow.

**Coherence:**

* The text jumps back and forth in time, with the author recounting events from different periods of his life in a non-chronological order.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the printing industry, art, and literature, which can make it difficult for readers without this knowledge to understand the context and significance of certain events.
* The text includes many tangential anecdotes and digressions, which can make it hard to follow the main thread of the narrative.
* The author's use of first-person and second-person narration can be confusing, as it is not always clear who is being addressed or what perspective the author is adopting.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and a coherent narrative voice.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
