The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author examines the Church's documents, including the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and Homilies, to ascertain the Church's teaching on the subject.

Issues affecting the fluency score:
* The text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge of theological concepts and Church history, which may make the text inaccessible to some readers.
* The text is densely packed with quotes and references to various Church documents, which can disrupt the flow of the argument.
* The author's writing style is often verbose, with long sentences and complex sentence structures.
* The text lacks clear headings, subheadings, and transitional phrases to guide the reader through the argument.

Issues affecting the coherence score:
* The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of transubstantiation to discussing adoration and sacrifice, without clear connections between the topics.
* The author's argument is not always clear, and the text often meanders through various tangents and subsidiary points.
* The author assumes that the reader is familiar with the context and background of the Reformation and the Church of England's history, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the argument.
* The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the main points, leaving the reader to distill the author's argument from the dense and complex discussion.
* The author's use of rhetorical questions and emotional appeals can make the text feel more like a persuasive essay than a clear and objective exposition of the Church's teaching.
