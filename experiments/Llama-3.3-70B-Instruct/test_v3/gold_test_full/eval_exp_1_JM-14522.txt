After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is quite long and dense, with long paragraphs and sentences that can be difficult to follow at times.
* The story jumps back and forth between different plot threads and characters, which can make it hard to keep track of what's happening.
* Some of the language and vocabulary used is quite formal and old-fashioned, which can make it difficult for modern readers to understand.
* There are some inconsistencies in the pacing of the story, with some sections feeling rushed and others feeling slow.
* The tone of the story can be somewhat inconsistent, veering between humor, horror, and sentimentality.

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-written and engaging, with a clear and consistent narrative voice. The author's use of language is often clever and witty, and the story has a clear structure and plot.

The main issues affecting coherence are:
* The story's non-linear structure and multiple plot threads can make it hard to follow at times.
* The character motivations and actions are not always clearly explained or consistent.
* The story's tone and pacing can be inconsistent, which can disrupt the reader's engagement and understanding.

The main issues affecting fluency are:
* The text's density and complexity can make it difficult to read and understand at times.
* The formal and old-fashioned language can be a barrier to understanding for some readers.
* The long paragraphs and sentences can make the text feel slow and plodding at times.
