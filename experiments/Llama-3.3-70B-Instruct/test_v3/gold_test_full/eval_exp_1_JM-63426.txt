* The use of colloquial expressions and slang from the late 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g., "Gay Nineties") may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* The text includes some technical terms related to printing and typography, which may require explanation or context for non-expert readers.

Issues affecting coherence:
* The text jumps back and forth between different periods of Bradley's life, which can make it challenging to follow the chronological order of events.
* Some chapters or sections seem to be loosely connected to the rest of the narrative, and their relevance to the overall story is not always clear.
* The text includes some tangential information and anecdotes that, while interesting, may not be essential to understanding Bradley's life and career.
* The author's use of first-person and second-person narration can be confusing, as it is not always clear who is speaking or being addressed.
