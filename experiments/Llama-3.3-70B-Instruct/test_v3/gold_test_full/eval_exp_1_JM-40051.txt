After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency:**

* The text is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow.
* The writing style is often verbose, with long sentences and paragraphs that lack clear structure.
* There are numerous instances of repetitive language and ideas, which can make the text feel tedious to read.
* The author frequently uses complex vocabulary and poetic language, which can be confusing or alienating to some readers.
* The text includes many tangential comments and asides, which can disrupt the flow of the main argument.

**Coherence:**

* The text lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to understand the author's main argument.
* The author jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, without providing clear transitions or connections.
* The text includes many unsubstantiated claims and assertions, which can make it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.
* The author relies heavily on biblical references and interpretations, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The text includes many descriptive passages that, while vivid and engaging, can feel disconnected from the main argument.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, making it a challenging read. While the author shows flashes of engaging writing and vivid description, the overall structure and organization of the text are unclear, and the writing style is often overly complex and repetitive.
