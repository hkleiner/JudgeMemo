After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are numerous long, complex sentences that contain multiple clauses, which can disrupt the flow of the text and make it harder to understand.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and theological concepts, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The text includes many Latin phrases and biblical references, which may not be immediately clear to non-expert readers.
* The author's argument is dense and nuanced, with many subtle distinctions and qualifications, which can make it challenging to follow.
* There are some minor errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, such as missing or incorrect articles, inconsistent verb tenses, and typos (e.g., "vommon" instead of "common", "srrvice" instead of "service", "tue" instead of "the").
* The text could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs more smoothly.
* Some paragraphs are very long and could be broken up to improve the text's overall structure and readability.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized, and the author's argument is clear and well-supported. The use of headings and subheadings helps to structure the text and guide the reader through the argument.
