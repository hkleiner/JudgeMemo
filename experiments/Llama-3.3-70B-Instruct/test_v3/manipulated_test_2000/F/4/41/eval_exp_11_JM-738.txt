After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers. This can make it difficult to follow and understand.
* There are numerous typos and errors in punctuation, such as missing or incorrect commas, semicolons, and apostrophes. For example, "seuzures" should be "seizures", "demned" should be "darned", "ajd" should be "and", etc.
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, making it hard to follow the author's train of thought. For example, the discussion of Dickens's life and writing style is suddenly interrupted by a description of the characters in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens, his works, and the historical context in which he wrote. This can make it difficult for readers who are not familiar with these topics to understand the text.
* The text includes long, convoluted sentences that are hard to follow. For example, the sentence "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" is a single sentence that contains multiple clauses and ideas.
* The text uses words and phrases that are no longer commonly used in modern English, such as "hab nab at a venture", "romam policier", and "gamin". While these words and phrases may be authentic to the time period in which the text was written, they can still be confusing for modern readers.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and coherent, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic, followed by a detailed analysis of the characters and plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, despite some abrupt transitions and assumptions of background knowledge. The fluency score is lower because of the complex sentence structures, archaic vocabulary, and numerous typos and errors in punctuation.
