After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* There are several typos and grammatical errors throughout the text, such as "wdll" instead of "will", "xnd" instead of "and", "simce" instead of "since", "fsw" instead of "few", "teh" instead of "the", etc. These errors disrupt the fluency of the text.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can make them difficult to follow.
* The text jumps abruptly from one scene to another, such as from the conversation between Mr. Otis and Lord Canterville to the description of the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase.
* The story relies heavily on dialogue, which can make it feel a bit disjointed at times.
* There are some inconsistencies in the text, such as the fact that Mrs. Umney is described as being "extremely upset" but then seems to recover quickly.
* The story assumes a certain level of cultural knowledge, such as the reference to Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover, which may not be familiar to all readers.

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The author does a good job of setting the scene and establishing the characters, and the plot is engaging and humorous.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
