After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

* The text contains numerous typos, grammatical errors, and punctuation mistakes, which disrupt the flow of reading and make it difficult to understand certain sentences.
* The narrative jumps abruptly between different time periods and locations, which can be confusing for the reader.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, making them hard to follow.
* The text lacks clear transitions between paragraphs, which can make it difficult to understand how the different sections relate to each other.
* The story includes many specific details and names, which can be overwhelming for the reader and make it hard to keep track of the main plot.
* The text often uses outdated language and slang, which can be unfamiliar to modern readers and make the text harder to understand.

Despite these issues, the text has a clear and engaging narrative voice, and the story is well-structured and easy to follow overall.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text has a clear narrative structure and the different sections are generally well-connected. However, the fluency score is lower due to the numerous errors, awkward phrasing, and outdated language, which can make the text difficult to read and understand.
