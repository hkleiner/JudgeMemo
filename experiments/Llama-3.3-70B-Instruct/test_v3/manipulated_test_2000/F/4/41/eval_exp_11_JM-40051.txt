After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* There are numerous grammatical errors, including missing or incorrect punctuation, verb tense inconsistencies, and incorrect word usage (e.g., "princopak" instead of "principal", "locayion" instead of "location", "cohsequently" instead of "consequently").
* The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* The author uses vague language and assumes a high level of background knowledge from the reader, which can make it hard to understand the context and references (e.g., the mention of "the antldiluvians" without explanation).
* The text includes long, rambling sentences that are difficult to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that are not clearly connected.
* The author's writing style is often overly descriptive and flowery, which can make the text feel verbose and tedious to read.
* There are some inconsistencies in the author's argument, such as the claim that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific region, but without providing clear evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim.

Despite these issues, the text does show some coherence in its overall structure, with the author attempting to present a clear argument and provide evidence to support their claims. However, the fluency of the text is significantly impaired by the numerous errors, awkward sentence structures, and vague language.
