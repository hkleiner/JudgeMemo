After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are several long, convoluted sentences that are hard to parse, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The narrative jumps abruptly between different topics and scenes, which can make it hard to follow.
* There are several instances of unclear or ambiguous language, such as the use of words like "babble" and "unintelligible" without clear explanation.
* The text includes several long, detailed descriptions of characters and settings, which can slow down the pace of the narrative.
* The use of quotes and references to other works can be confusing, especially for readers who are not familiar with the context.
* The text includes several instances of unclear or inconsistent punctuation, such as missing or misplaced commas and semicolons.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic and sets up the context for the rest of the text.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The fluency score is lower because of the issues with sentence structure, language, and punctuation, which can make the text harder to read and understand.
