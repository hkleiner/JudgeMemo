After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the quality of the text in terms of fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* The text contains some awkward phrasing and sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow at times. For example, the sentence "My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can" is almost incomprehensible due to its poor construction.
* There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs or scenes, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. For instance, the transition from the description of the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the scene where Washington Otis is talking to Lord Canterville is not smooth.
* The text contains some inconsistencies in tone and style, which can affect its overall coherence. For example, the story starts as a serious ghost story but then becomes more humorous and satirical.
* The text has some missing or incomplete sentences, such as "CHAPTER: nothing" which seems to be a mistake.
* The story jumps abruptly from one scene to another, without clear connections between them. For example, the scene where Mr. Otis meets the ghost is not well-connected to the previous scene.
* The text contains some words or phrases that are unclear or ambiguous, such as "the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" which may be unfamiliar to some readers.

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-organized, and the ideas are connected in a logical way. The narrative is engaging, and the characters are well-developed.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the story has a clear structure, and the ideas are generally well-connected. However, the fluency score is lower due to the awkward phrasing, inconsistent tone, and abrupt transitions, which can make the text difficult to follow at times.
