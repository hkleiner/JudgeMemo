After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* The sentences are often long and convoluted, with multiple clauses and phrases that can make them hard to understand.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and the controversy surrounding the Real Presence, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The author uses technical terms and jargon, such as "sacramental appointment" and "invisibly bestows the invisible gift," which may be unclear to non-experts.
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the definition of a sacrament, the doctrine of the Real Presence, and the author's personal beliefs, which can disrupt the flow of the argument.
* The author uses rhetorical questions and phrases, such as "It would be strange indeed if...," which can make the text feel less formal and more persuasive than informative.
* The text includes some unclear or ambiguous sentences, such as "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that," which may be due to a transcription error or poor writing.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author provides a clear thesis statement and supports it with evidence from the Church of England's documents.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The text scores high on coherence because it is well-organized and easy to follow, despite some jumps in topic and unclear sentences. However, it scores lower on fluency due to its formal, archaic style, long sentences, and technical jargon, which can make it difficult for readers to understand.
