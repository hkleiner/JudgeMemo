After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and word choices that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* There are several instances of awkward phrasing, such as "On the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,'" which could be rephrased for better clarity.
* The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, such as the transition from discussing the author's discovery to describing the geography of the Garden of Eden.
* There are several instances of repetitive language and ideas, such as the repeated references to the beauty of the Garden of Eden.
* The text includes several sentences that are difficult to follow due to their length and complexity, such as the sentence that begins "The river here, as in most places, has three banks..."
* There are several instances of unclear or ambiguous language, such as the phrase "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,'" which appears to be a jumbled and nonsensical sentence.
* The text includes several tangential comments and asides, such as the discussion of the name "La Crosse" and its connection to an ancient game.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some strengths in terms of coherence, such as:

* The author provides a clear thesis statement and attempts to support it with evidence and reasoning.
* The text includes several vivid and descriptive passages that help to create a sense of atmosphere and setting.

However, the issues with fluency and coherence are significant enough to detract from the overall quality of the text.
