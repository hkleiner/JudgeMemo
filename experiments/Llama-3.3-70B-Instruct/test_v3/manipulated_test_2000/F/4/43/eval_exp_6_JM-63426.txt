After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are some long, convoluted sentences that disrupt the flow of the text.
* The narrative jumps back and forth between different time periods and locations, which can be confusing.
* Some sentences are wordy or contain unnecessary phrases, which can make them hard to understand.
* The text assumes a certain level of background knowledge about the time period and the protagonist's life, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* There are some inconsistencies in formatting and punctuation, such as missing or extra spaces, and inconsistent use of quotation marks.
* The text contains some colloquial expressions and slang terms that may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers.
* The story is written in a somewhat informal, conversational tone, which may not be suitable for all audiences.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative thread and well-developed characters. The author's use of descriptive language and vivid imagery helps to bring the story to life and engage the reader.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative thread and well-developed characters. The fluency score is lower because of the issues with sentence structure, word choice, and formatting, which can make the text difficult to read and understand at times.
