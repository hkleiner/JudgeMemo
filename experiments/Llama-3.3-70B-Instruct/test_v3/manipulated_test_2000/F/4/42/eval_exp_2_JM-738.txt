After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers. This can make the text difficult to follow and understand.
* There are several instances of inconsistent verb tense usage, with the text switching between past and present tense without clear justification.
* The text includes many long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to follow. This can disrupt the flow of the narrative and make it difficult for the reader to stay engaged.
* The story jumps abruptly between different scenes and plot threads, which can be disorienting for the reader.
* The text includes many references to external sources and allusions to other works of literature, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with these references.
* The writing style is often overly formal and dense, with long paragraphs and few breaks to separate different ideas or scenes.
* There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, and inconsistent punctuation.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the story and its characters, and the plot is engaging and well-developed.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The fluency score is lower because of the issues with sentence structure, verb tense, and writing style, which can make the text difficult to read and understand.
