After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

* The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect verb conjugations, incorrect use of tenses, and inconsistent subject-verb agreement.
* There are many instances of awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, and sentence fragments, which disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text lacks consistency in formatting, with inconsistent indentation, spacing, and paragraph breaks.
* The narrative jumps abruptly between different time periods and events, making it difficult to follow the storyline.
* The text contains many colloquial expressions, slang, and regional dialects, which may be unfamiliar to some readers and affect the overall clarity of the text.
* The story is written in a somewhat informal and conversational tone, which may not be suitable for all audiences.
* There are several instances of unclear or ambiguous language, such as the use of vague pronouns or unclear references to people or events.

Despite these issues, the text has a certain charm and nostalgic value, and the story is engaging and interesting. However, the numerous errors and inconsistencies detract from the overall quality of the text.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The coherence score is 3 because the text has a clear overall structure and narrative, but the jumps in time and events, as well as the unclear language, make it difficult to follow at times. The fluency score is 2 because the text is marred by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent formatting, which disrupt the flow of the text and make it difficult to read.
