After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

* The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation mistakes. For example, "when they come to discuss terms" should be "when they came to discuss terms", and "the blood-stain has been much admire" should be "the blood-stain has been much admired".
* The text also contains some awkward phrasing and sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language" is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.
* The text jumps abruptly from one scene to another, without clear transitions. For example, the story shifts from the introduction of the Otis family to their arrival at Canterville Chase without a clear connection between the two scenes.
* Some sentences are wordy or contain unnecessary words, which can make the text feel cluttered. For example, the sentence "The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he have been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime" could be simplified to "The family became interested, with Mr. Otis questioning his denial of ghosts, Mrs. Otis considering joining the Psychical Society, and Washington writing to Messrs. Myers and Podmore about the stain".
* The text contains some inconsistencies in character development and behavior. For example, Mr. Otis is portrayed as a skeptical and practical person, but his reaction to the ghost is somewhat inconsistent with this characterization.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative structure and a consistent tone. The story is engaging and humorous, with well-developed characters and a clear plot.
