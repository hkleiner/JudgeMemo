After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and word choices that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* There are numerous grammatical errors, including verb tense inconsistencies, subject-verb agreement issues, and missing or incorrect punctuation.
* The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* The author uses vague language and assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Bible and geography, which may make it hard for some readers to understand the context.
* The text is overly descriptive and repetitive, with long, winding sentences that repeat the same ideas multiple times.
* The author's tone is sometimes unclear, veering between formal and informal language, and between serious and playful tone.
* The text includes many proper nouns and geographical references that may be unfamiliar to non-American readers.

Some specific examples of these issues include:
* The sentence "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism" is unclear and lacks proper punctuation.
* The phrase "the finger of time has am plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place" is awkwardly phrased and uses an unclear metaphor.
* The sentence "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark,—densely cover with forest trees, which consitutes the islands and 'river bottoms'—cut up by water courses and sloughs" is overly complex and hard to follow.
* The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions assumes a high level of background knowledge that may not be shared by all readers.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
The text has some clear and well-organized sections, but overall it is difficult to follow due to abrupt jumps between ideas, vague language, and assumptions about the reader's background knowledge.

FINAL Fluency Score: 2
The text is often awkwardly phrased, with grammatical errors, unclear sentence structures, and overly complex vocabulary that makes it hard to read smoothly. The author's tone and language are also inconsistent, which detracts from the overall fluency of the text.
