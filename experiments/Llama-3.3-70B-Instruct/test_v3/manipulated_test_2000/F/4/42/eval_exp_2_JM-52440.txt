After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and outdated vocabulary, which can make it difficult to follow for modern readers.
* There are numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb conjugations, missing or incorrect articles, and inconsistent use of verb tenses.
* The text often uses ambiguous or unclear language, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
* The author frequently uses long, convoluted sentences that contain multiple clauses, which can disrupt the flow of the text and make it harder to follow.
* The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, without clear transitions or connections between them.
* The author often uses technical or specialized terms, such as "sacramental appointment" and "invisibly to feed the soul," without explaining them or providing context for readers who may be unfamiliar with these concepts.
* The text includes numerous quotes and references to external sources, such as the Bible and the Church of England's Articles and Liturgy, which can disrupt the flow of the text and make it harder to follow.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some strengths in terms of coherence, such as:

* The author provides a clear introduction to the topic and states their purpose and objectives.
* The text is well-organized, with clear headings and sections that help to structure the argument.
* The author attempts to provide evidence and supporting arguments for their claims, using quotes and references to external sources.

However, the numerous issues with fluency and coherence detract from the overall quality of the text.
