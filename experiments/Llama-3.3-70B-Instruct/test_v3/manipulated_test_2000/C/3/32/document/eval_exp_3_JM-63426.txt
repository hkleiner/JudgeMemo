After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

* The text contains numerous instances of unclear or missing information, such as "a thing" or "stuff", which disrupts the flow of the narrative and makes it difficult to understand the context.
* The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and locations, which can be disorienting for the reader.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can make them hard to follow.
* The text includes some outdated or obscure terms, such as "Narrow Gauge" or "picklelime", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* The narrative sometimes feels disjointed or fragmented, with ideas or events not fully developed or connected to the rest of the story.
* The text could benefit from more transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the narrative and connect the different ideas and events.

Despite these issues, the text has a clear and engaging narrative voice, and the author's enthusiasm and admiration for Will Bradley are evident throughout. The story also provides interesting insights into Bradley's life and career, and the historical context in which he worked.
