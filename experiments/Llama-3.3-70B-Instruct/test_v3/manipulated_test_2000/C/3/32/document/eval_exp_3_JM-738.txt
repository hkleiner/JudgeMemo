After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are several instances of unclear or ambiguous language, such as the use of phrases like "a stuff" and "a thing" without clear referents.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The story is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, with abrupt transitions between different scenes and ideas.
* Some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow.
* The text includes several references to external sources, such as Forster and Mr. Proctor, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The story is heavily analytical and critical, which may make it dry and difficult to read for some readers.
* The text includes several instances of repetition, such as the repeated references to Jasper's opium use and his passion for Rosa.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic and sets up the context for the analysis of Dickens's last plot.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The fluency score is lower because of the issues with unclear language, awkward sentence structure, and repetitive references. Overall, the text is well-suited for an academic or critical audience, but may be challenging for general readers.
