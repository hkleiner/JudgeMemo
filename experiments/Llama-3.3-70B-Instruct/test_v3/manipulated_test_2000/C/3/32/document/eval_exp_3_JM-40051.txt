After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with complex sentence structures and word choices that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* There are numerous instances of vague or ambiguous language, such as the repeated use of "the thing" without clear reference.
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the description of the Garden of Eden and the discussion of the author's discovery.
* The author's tone is sometimes inconsistent, veering between formal and informal language.
* There are several instances of repetitive language and ideas, which can make the text feel redundant and slow-paced.
* The text includes several long, winding sentences that can be difficult to follow.
* The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Bible and geography, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The text includes several phrases and sentences that seem out of place or unnecessary, such as the discussion of the city of La Crosse's name.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some strengths in terms of coherence, such as:

* The author's clear passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter, which helps to drive the narrative forward.
* The use of vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the Garden of Eden.
* The attempt to provide a clear structure and organization to the text, with the use of transitional phrases and sentences.

However, the issues with fluency and coherence are significant enough to impact the overall quality of the text. Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The coherence score of 3 reflects the text's ability to convey a clear and organized narrative, despite some issues with transitions and consistency. The fluency score of 2 reflects the text's difficulties with sentence structure, word choice, and overall readability.
