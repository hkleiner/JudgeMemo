After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a formal, archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* The sentences are often long and convoluted, with multiple clauses and phrases that can make them hard to parse.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and the controversy surrounding the Real Presence, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The author uses technical terms and jargon, such as "sacramental appointment" and "invisibly to feed the soul," which may be unclear to non-experts.
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the definition of a sacrament, the doctrine of the Real Presence, and the author's personal beliefs, which can disrupt the flow of the argument.
* The author uses rhetorical questions and phrases, such as "Is it not plain from Scripture?" which can make the text feel more like a sermon than a formal argument.
* The text includes long quotations from Scripture and the Church of England's documents, which can break up the flow of the argument and make it harder to follow.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and a logical progression of ideas. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic, explains the key concepts and terms, and presents a clear argument about the Church of England's doctrine on the Real Presence.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The text scores high on coherence because it presents a clear and logical argument, with a well-organized structure and a clear progression of ideas. However, it scores lower on fluency due to its formal and archaic style, long and convoluted sentences, and technical jargon, which can make it difficult for readers to follow.
