After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text contains some awkward phrasing and sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow at times. For example, the sentence "Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with a stuff nowadays, except, of course, language" is a bit convoluted and hard to understand.
* There are some instances of unclear or missing words, such as "a thing" and "a stuff", which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The story jumps abruptly from one scene to another, without clear transitions. For example, the transition from the family's conversation at supper to Mr. Otis's encounter with the ghost is quite sudden.
* Some sentences are quite long and contain multiple clauses, which can make them hard to follow. For example, the sentence "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive, and they did not return home till nine o'clock, when they had a light supper" is a bit of a run-on.
* The text contains some anachronistic language and cultural references, which can be jarring for modern readers. For example, the reference to "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover" and "the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" may be unfamiliar to some readers.

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative structure and well-developed characters. The author's use of descriptive language and witty dialogue adds to the story's charm and humor.
