After carefully reading the text, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are many long, complex sentences that can be hard to parse.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The narrative jumps abruptly between different scenes and characters, which can be disorienting.
* Some of the language and terminology used is outdated or obscure, which can make it hard to understand.
* The text includes many references to other works and authors, which can be distracting and disrupt the flow of the narrative.
