After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text contains some anachronistic elements, such as the mention of a "hologram", "bluetooth signal", and "surveillance camera", which seem out of place in a story set in the late 19th or early 20th century.
* There are some abrupt transitions between sentences and paragraphs, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The text includes some long, convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow.
* The story jumps abruptly from a serious and spooky atmosphere to a more humorous and lighthearted tone, which can be jarring for the reader.
* Some of the language and phrases used, such as "spry young fellows painting the Old World red" and "the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the London drawl", may be unfamiliar or confusing to non-native English speakers.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and engaging, with a clear and consistent narrative voice. The story is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
