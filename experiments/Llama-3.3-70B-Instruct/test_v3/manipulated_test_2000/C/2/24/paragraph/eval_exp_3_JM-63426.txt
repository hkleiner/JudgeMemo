After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is written in a somewhat old-fashioned style, which may make it less accessible to modern readers.
* There are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs, particularly in the second chapter, where the narrative jumps between different events and settings without clear connections.
* The text includes some tangential details, such as the description of the home assistant playing ambient music, which seems out of place in the narrative.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text assumes some background knowledge of historical events and cultural references, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* The narrative sometimes feels disjointed, with events and characters introduced without clear context or resolution.

Despite these issues, the text has some strengths, such as its vivid descriptions of settings and characters, and its engaging narrative voice.

Here are my final scores:

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because, despite some abrupt transitions and tangential details, the text generally follows a clear narrative thread and explores themes and ideas in a logical and consistent way. The fluency score is lower because of the text's sometimes awkward phrasing, wordiness, and old-fashioned style, which can make it harder to follow and less engaging to read.
