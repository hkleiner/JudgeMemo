After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, with long, convoluted sentences and overly complex vocabulary, which can make it difficult to follow.
* The author frequently uses rhetorical questions, exclamations, and poetic language, which can disrupt the flow of the text and make it feel less cohesive.
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the author's personal discovery, biblical references, and descriptive passages about the landscape, without clear transitions or connections.
* The author uses vague phrases, such as "the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead,'" without explaining their meaning or relevance to the rest of the text.
* The text includes numerous tangents and asides, such as the discussion of the name "La Crosse" and its connection to an ancient game, which can feel distracting and unrelated to the main topic.
* The author's tone can be inconsistent, veering between formal and informal, and sometimes feeling overly promotional or enthusiastic.
* The text includes some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some strengths in terms of coherence, such as:

* The author provides a clear thesis statement and attempts to support it with evidence and reasoning.
* The text includes some effective descriptive passages that help to create a vivid image of the landscape.
* The author attempts to engage the reader and encourage them to imagine themselves in the scene.

However, overall, the issues with fluency and coherence detract from the text's effectiveness.
