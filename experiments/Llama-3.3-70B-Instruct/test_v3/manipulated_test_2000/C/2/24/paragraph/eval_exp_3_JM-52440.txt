After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text is quite lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow at times.
* There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs, and the connections between ideas could be smoother.
* The language is formal and archaic, which may hinder readability for some readers.
* The text includes sudden and unrelated phrases, such as "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb," which disrupt the flow of the text.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and theological concepts, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand.
* The author's tone is sometimes argumentative, which may make the text feel less objective and more persuasive.
* The text includes long, complex sentences that can be hard to follow.
* The use of Latin phrases, such as "κοινωνία," may not be familiar to all readers.

Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a clear and well-structured argument, and the author's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition and analogy, helps to clarify their points.
