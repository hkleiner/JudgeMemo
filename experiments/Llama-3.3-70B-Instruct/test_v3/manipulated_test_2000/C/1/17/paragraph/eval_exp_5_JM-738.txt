After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues that affected my ratings:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow.
* There are long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to parse, which affects the text's fluency.
* The story jumps abruptly between different scenes and characters, which can disrupt the coherence of the narrative.
* Some paragraphs seem to be more like essays or analyses of the story rather than part of the story itself, which can make the text feel disjointed.
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* There are some unclear or ambiguous sentences, such as the one starting with "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling."
* The text includes many proper nouns and references to other works, which can make it hard to follow for readers who are not familiar with them.
* The story is heavily focused on analysis and explanation, which can make it feel more like a critical essay than a narrative.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-structured and well-written, with a clear and consistent tone. The author's use of language is often vivid and engaging, and the story has a clear sense of atmosphere and setting.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
