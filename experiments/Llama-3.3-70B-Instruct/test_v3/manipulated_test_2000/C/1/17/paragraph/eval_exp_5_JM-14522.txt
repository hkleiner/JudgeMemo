After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues I found:

* The text appears to be a collection of different stories or fragments, with abrupt shifts in narrative, characters, and setting. This disrupts the coherence of the text and makes it difficult to follow.
* There are multiple instances of unrelated paragraphs or sentences that seem to be inserted randomly, such as the discussion about Christmas, the description of Stransom and Paul Creston, and the passage about the summer holiday. These insertions disrupt the flow of the main narrative.
* The text jumps back and forth between different narrative styles, including descriptive passages, dialogue, and exposition. While this can be effective in some cases, it is not well-executed here and creates a sense of disjointedness.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can make them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "The peculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a vacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude towards another vacation--the summer holiday" is a bit of a mouthful.
* The text assumes a significant amount of background knowledge about the characters, setting, and plot, which can make it difficult for readers to understand what is happening. For example, the character of Stransom is introduced without any context or explanation.
* The tone of the text is inconsistent, veering wildly from humorous to serious to descriptive.

Despite these issues, the text does have some fluent and coherent passages, particularly in the later chapters. The dialogue is often witty and engaging, and the descriptive passages can be vivid and evocative.
