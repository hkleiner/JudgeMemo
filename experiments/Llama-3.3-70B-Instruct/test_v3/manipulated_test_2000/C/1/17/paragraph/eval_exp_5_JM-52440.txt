After carefully reading the given text, several issues affecting its fluency and coherence have been identified:

- **Abrupt Transitions**: The text jumps abruptly between different narratives and topics without smooth transitions, making it difficult to follow. For example, it shifts from a discussion about the Church of England and the doctrine of the Real Presence to a story about a ghost and then to a character's personal reflections without any connecting narrative or thematic link.
- **Lack of Clear Structure**: The text lacks a clear, overarching structure. It seems to combine unrelated chapters or sections from different books, including what appears to be a theological treatise, a ghost story, and a character study, without any apparent connection between them.
- **Disjointed Narratives**: The inclusion of multiple, unrelated narratives (e.g., the discussion on the Church of England, the story about the stain of blood, and George Stransom's reflections) disrupts the coherence of the text. Each narrative has its own distinct tone, style, and subject matter, which further exacerbates the disjointedness.
- **Variation in Tone and Style**: The tone and style vary significantly across the different parts of the text. The theological discussion is formal and academic, the ghost story is suspenseful and mysterious, and the character study is reflective and emotional. This variation, while not inherently bad, contributes to the text's overall disjointedness when presented together without a clear connection.
- **Grammar and Punctuation**: While the text is generally well-punctuated and grammatically correct, the complexity of some sentences and the lack of clarity in transitions can make it hard to read smoothly.

Considering these issues, the text faces significant challenges in terms of both fluency and coherence.
