After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the quality of the text in terms of fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text jumps abruptly between different topics and time periods, making it difficult to follow the narrative. For example, the story starts with an introduction to Will Bradley, then suddenly shifts to a scene in London, and later jumps to Bradley's childhood in Massachusetts.
* The text includes many unrelated details and anecdotes, such as the description of the shop-front in London, the story of Sir Simon, and the details about the printing press, which disrupt the flow of the narrative.
* The writing style is often informal and conversational, which can make it difficult to follow for readers who are not familiar with the author's tone and language.
* The text includes many long, convoluted sentences that are hard to follow, such as the sentence that starts with "It is your second year in school...".
* The story lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to understand the author's main points and the connections between different events.
* The text includes many proper nouns and specific details that may be unfamiliar to readers, such as the names of people, places, and events, which can make it harder to follow the narrative.
* The author often uses vague transitions and connections between paragraphs, making it difficult to understand how the different sections of the text relate to each other.

Despite these issues, the text has some strengths, such as its vivid descriptions and engaging anecdotes. However, the problems with fluency and coherence detract from the overall quality of the text.
