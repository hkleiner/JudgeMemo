After carefully reading the given text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

* The text appears to be a collection of unrelated passages, with abrupt shifts in topic, tone, and style. This disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow.
* There are multiple narrative voices and perspectives, which can be confusing for the reader.
* The text includes passages that seem to be from different genres, such as romance, mystery, and biblical commentary, which can be jarring and disrupt the coherence of the text.
* Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can impede fluency.
* The text includes passages that appear to be quotes or excerpts from other works, without clear attribution or context.
* The text lacks a clear structure or organization, with ideas and topics introduced and then abandoned without resolution.

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The low coherence score reflects the text's lack of clear organization, abrupt shifts in topic and tone, and confusing narrative voices. The fluency score is slightly higher, as some passages are well-written and easy to follow, but the overall text is still marred by wordy or awkward sentences and unclear structure.
