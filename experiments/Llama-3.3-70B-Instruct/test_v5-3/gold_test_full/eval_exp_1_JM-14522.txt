* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them hard to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between chapters and scenes can be abrupt, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and complex vocabulary may be challenging for some readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure.
