Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the appearance of the ghost, with little build-up or tension.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between chapters feels disjointed, with little connection between the events of the first and second chapters.
* [LEXICON] The use of overly formal and antiquated language may be off-putting to some readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure.
