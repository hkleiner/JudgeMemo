Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR]: Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* [LEXICON]: The text includes some archaic vocabulary and phrases that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [STRUCTURE]: The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the appearance of the ghost.
* [CLARITY]: Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, such as the description of the ghost's appearance and actions.
* [TRANSITION]: The transition between chapters is not clearly marked, and the story picks up suddenly without much connection to the previous events.
