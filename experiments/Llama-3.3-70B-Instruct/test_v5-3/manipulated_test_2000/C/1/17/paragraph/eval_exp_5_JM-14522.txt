Issues:
* [COHERENCE] The story seems to jump abruptly between different scenes and characters, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [COHERENCE] The inclusion of unrelated passages, such as the discussion about Christmas and the description of Stransom's encounter with Paul Creston, appears to be unnecessary and confusing.
* [COHERENCE] The transition between chapters is not smooth, and the story lacks a clear structure.
* [FLUENCY] There are some awkward phrasings and sentence constructions, such as the use of complex sentences with multiple clauses.
* [FLUENCY] The text contains some words and phrases that are no longer commonly used, which may make it difficult for modern readers to understand.
* [LOGIC] The character of Mr. Otis seems to be inconsistent in his reactions to the ghost, sometimes being calm and rational, and other times being more emotional.
* [STRUCTURE] The story has a meandering plot, with some events and characters feeling disconnected from the main narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
