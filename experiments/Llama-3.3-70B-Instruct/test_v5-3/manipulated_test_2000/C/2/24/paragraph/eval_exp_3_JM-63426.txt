Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR]: Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
* [TRANSITION]: The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and ideas, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [CLARITY]: Certain sections, such as the description of the print shop and the jobs Will Bradley held, are unclear and lack specific details.
* [STRUCTURE]: The story lacks a clear chronological structure, with events and anecdotes presented in a non-linear fashion.
* [LEXICON]: The use of outdated terms and phrases, such as "picklelime" and "Narrow Gauge", may be unfamiliar to modern readers and disrupt the flow of the text.
