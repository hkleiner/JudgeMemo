Issues: 
* [ANACHRONISM] - The appearance of modern technology such as a hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera in a story set in the past disrupts the narrative's historical setting.
* [INCONSISTENCY] - The sudden introduction of unrelated topics like the comparison of Miss Fanny Devonport and Sarah Bernhardt, or the discussion on the baggage-check system, seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the story.
* [LOGIC] - Some events, such as the ghost's reaction to the lubricator and the sudden appearance of the twins with a pillow, feel somewhat convenient or unexplained, which can affect the story's logical progression.
* [TRANSITION] - The shift between chapters and scenes sometimes feels abrupt, lacking smooth transitions to guide the reader through the narrative.
