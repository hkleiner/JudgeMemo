Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a collection of chapters and sections that seem to be part of a larger analysis or critique of Charles Dickens's last novel, but the transitions between these sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain multiple clauses, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Dickens's life and writing style to analyzing specific characters and plot points in "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* [LEXICON] The use of some words and phrases, such as "demned outline" and "hab nab at a venture", may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [SYNTAX] A few sentences have awkward or unclear syntax, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
