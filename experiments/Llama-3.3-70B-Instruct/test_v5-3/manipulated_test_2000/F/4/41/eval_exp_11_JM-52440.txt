Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Multiple instances of missing or incorrect articles ("a", "the") and incorrect verb tenses.
* [SPELLING] Several spelling errors, such as "vommon" instead of "common", "srrvice" instead of "service", "prssent" instead of "present", "wnd" instead of "and".
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, disrupting the flow of the text.
* [LEXICON] A few words are used inappropriately or with unclear meanings, such as "establisjed" instead of "established".
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and concepts without clear transitions.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with some sections feeling disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or difficult to understand due to poor phrasing or word choice.
* [TRANSITION] The text often fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it hard to follow.
