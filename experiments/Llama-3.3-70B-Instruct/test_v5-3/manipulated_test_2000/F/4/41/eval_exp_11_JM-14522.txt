Issues: 
* [SPELLING] numerous typos and spelling errors throughout the text, such as "seej" instead of "seen", "wdll" instead of "will", "xnd" instead of "and", "nonsensd" instead of "nonsense", "simce" instead of "since", "afger" instead of "after", "fsw" instead of "few", "tuey" instead of "they", "reavhed" instead of "reached", "xven" instead of "seven", "vety" instead of "very", "guarfians" instead of "guardians", "waw" instead of "was", "Myerw" instead of "Myers", "librwry" instead of "library", "evwrything" instead of "everything", "anmold" instead of "an old", "obpong" instead of "small", "phial" is correct but "obpong" is not, "tor" instead of "for", "Unoted" instead of "United", "indignation" is correct but the sentence structure is awkward.
* [GRAMMAR] some sentences are awkwardly structured or worded, making them hard to follow.
* [LEXICON] some words are used incorrectly or in an outdated manner, such as "quaint, old-fashioned manner" which could be simplified.
* [CLARITY] the text could benefit from clearer transitions between scenes and ideas.
* [STRUCTURE] the story jumps abruptly from one scene to another, disrupting the flow.
