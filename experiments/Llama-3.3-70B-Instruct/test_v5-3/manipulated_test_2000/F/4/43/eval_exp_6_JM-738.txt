Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow.
* [LEXICON] The text features some archaic vocabulary and phrases that may be unfamiliar to modern readers, such as "hab nab at a venture" and "roman policier".
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly between different scenes and characters, which can be disorienting for the reader.
* [CLARITY] Some sections of the text are dense with information and lack clear transitions between ideas, making it difficult to understand the plot and characters.
* [TRANSITION] The text could benefit from more explicit connections between different sections and ideas to improve the overall flow and coherence.
