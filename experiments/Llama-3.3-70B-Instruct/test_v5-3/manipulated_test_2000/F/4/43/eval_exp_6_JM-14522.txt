Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR]: In the sentence "My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can", the grammar is completely off, making it hard to understand the intended meaning.
* [LEXICON]: The use of words like "prima reckon" and "red-a" in the same sentence seems out of place and unclear.
* [STRUCTURE]: The transition between the conversation about the ghost and the description of the family's arrival at Canterville Chase feels a bit abrupt.
* [CLARITY]: Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear phrases, making them hard to follow.
* [SYNTAX]: There are places where the sentence structure is awkward or confusing, disrupting the flow of the text.
