Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR]: Several sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain grammatical errors, such as "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river 'below greed,' on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to," which is nearly incomprehensible.
* [CLARITY]: The text often lacks clarity, with abrupt jumps between ideas and insufficient transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [STRUCTURE]: The narrative structure is not well-organized, with the author jumping back and forth between describing the Garden of Eden, its location, and its characteristics without a clear logical flow.
* [LEXICON]: The text contains some archaic or overly formal language, such as "antldiluvians" and "euphony," which may be unfamiliar to modern readers and detract from the text's overall readability.
* [LOGIC]: Some of the author's arguments and conclusions seem illogical or unsupported, such as the claim that the Garden of Eden must be located in a specific region of the American continent without providing convincing evidence.
