Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is incomplete, as Dickens died before finishing it, which affects the overall coherence and flow of the narrative.
* [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are ambiguous, leaving the reader to interpret the events and characters' motivations, which can lead to confusion.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and scenes can be abrupt, disrupting the flow of the story.
* [LEXICON] The language and vocabulary used are sometimes archaic and may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which can hinder understanding.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in punctuation, although these are relatively minor.
