Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and divided into chapters, which may make it difficult to follow for some readers.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, which can lead to confusion.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between some chapters and scenes feels abrupt, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [LEXICON] The use of outdated vocabulary and phrases, such as "egad" and "medi√¶valism," may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The plot relies on some convenient coincidences and unexplained events, which may strain credibility.
