Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text is lengthy and contains many repetitive arguments, which can make it difficult to follow.
* [STRUCTURE] The chapters and sections are not clearly defined, and the transitions between ideas can be abrupt.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain complex vocabulary, which can make them hard to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to discussing adoration and sacrifice.
* [LEXICON] The use of technical terms and jargon can be alienating to readers who are not familiar with theological debates.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some minor errors in punctuation and sentence structure.
