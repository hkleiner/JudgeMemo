Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and jumps between different periods of the author's life, making it hard to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, which can make them difficult to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother, as they sometimes feel abrupt.
* [LEXICON] The use of outdated terms and phrases, such as "Gay Nineties" and "Victorian parlor," may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of sentence fragments and run-on sentences.
