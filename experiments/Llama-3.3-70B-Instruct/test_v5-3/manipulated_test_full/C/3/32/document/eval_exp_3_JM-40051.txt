* [LOGIC] The author's argument relies heavily on unsubstantiated claims and assumptions, rather than evidence or logical reasoning.
* [LEXICON] The author's use of language is often overly formal and verbose, which can make the text difficult to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, without clear connections or transitions.
