Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and divided into seven chapters, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them hard to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between chapters and scenes could be smoother, as some parts feel disconnected from the rest of the story.
* [LEXICON] The use of outdated vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "thing" instead of a specific noun) may confuse modern readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of inconsistent verb tense and sentence structure.
