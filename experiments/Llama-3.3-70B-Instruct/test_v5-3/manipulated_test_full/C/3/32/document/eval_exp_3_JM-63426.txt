Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and jumps between different periods of the author's life without a clear chronological order.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections can be abrupt, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [LEXICON] The use of outdated terms and phrases, such as "the thing" and "a stuff", can be confusing and detract from the overall readability of the text.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses, that can make the text harder to understand.
