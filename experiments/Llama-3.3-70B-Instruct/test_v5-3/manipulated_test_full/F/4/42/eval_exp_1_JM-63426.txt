Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and jumps between different periods of the author's life without a clear chronological order.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and ideas are sometimes abrupt, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
* [LEXICON] The use of outdated terms and phrases, such as "Gay Nineties" and "Victorian period", may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses, that detract from the overall quality of the writing.
