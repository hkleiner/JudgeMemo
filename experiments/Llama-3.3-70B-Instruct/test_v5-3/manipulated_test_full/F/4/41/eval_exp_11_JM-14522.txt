Issues: 
* [SPELLING] Several typos and spelling mistakes throughout the text, such as "biught" instead of "bought", "wyen" instead of "when", "xnd" instead of "and", etc.
* [GRAMMAR] Some sentences have incorrect grammar, such as "He had bot appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years;" which should be "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years;"
* [LEXICON] Some words are used incorrectly, such as "efror" instead of "error", "an 'twere" instead of "as if it were"
* [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and has many chapters, but the transitions between them could be smoother
* [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are confusing, such as the ghost's backstory and motivations
* [TRANSITION] The story jumps abruptly from the ghost's attempts to scare the family to Virginia's disappearance and the search for her
