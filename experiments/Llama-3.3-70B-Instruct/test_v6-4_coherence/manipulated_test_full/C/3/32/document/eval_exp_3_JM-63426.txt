1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a collection of memoirs and anecdotes that jump back and forth in time, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative thread.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections are sometimes abrupt, lacking clear connections between ideas.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
