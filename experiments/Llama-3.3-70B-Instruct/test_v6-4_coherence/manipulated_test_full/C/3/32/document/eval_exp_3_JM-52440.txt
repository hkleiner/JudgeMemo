Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain complex theological concepts that may be difficult for non-experts to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice, without clear connections between them.
