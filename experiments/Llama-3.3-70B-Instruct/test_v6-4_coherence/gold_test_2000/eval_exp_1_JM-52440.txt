Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing the doctrine of the Real Presence and the author's personal beliefs without a clear transition.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.
* [TRANSITION] The text abruptly shifts from introducing the topic to delving into specific details without a smooth connection.
