The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentence structure can be dense and convoluted at times, making it challenging to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-organized and logically structured, with each section building on the previous one to form a clear argument. However, the text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
