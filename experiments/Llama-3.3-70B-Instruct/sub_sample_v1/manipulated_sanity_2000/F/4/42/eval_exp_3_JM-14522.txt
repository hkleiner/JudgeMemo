The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," exhibits a unique blend of humor, satire, and horror elements. In terms of coherence, the narrative is well-structured and easy to follow, with each chapter building on the previous one to create a cohesive story. The author's use of descriptive language and vivid imagery helps to establish a clear atmosphere and setting. However, the text's fluency is somewhat hindered by the intentional use of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which are meant to parody the American characters' speech patterns. Despite this, the text remains engaging and readable.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
