The text is a well-structured and informative introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The author's writing is formal and descriptive, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The text is coherent, with each paragraph building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive understanding of Millet's art and its significance. However, the writing style is somewhat archaic and may be challenging for modern readers to follow. The sentences are often long and complex, which can affect the text's fluency.
