The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a well-structured narrative that flows logically from one event to the next. The story is engaging, and the author's use of descriptive language and witty dialogue adds to its charm. However, the fluency of the text is somewhat compromised by the presence of grammatical errors, inconsistent verb tenses, and awkward sentence constructions, which may hinder the reader's understanding.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
