The text is a formal and structured discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of coherence, the text is well-organized and logically structured, with each chapter and section building on the previous one to form a clear argument. The author presents a clear thesis and supports it with references to Scripture and the Church's documents. However, the text is dense and complex, with long sentences and technical vocabulary, which may make it challenging to follow for some readers. Regarding fluency, the text is generally well-written, but there are some errors in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure, which detract from its overall quality.
