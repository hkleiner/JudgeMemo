The text is a historical narrative about imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written with complex sentences and proper grammar, but it can be dense and challenging to follow at times due to the use of archaic language and lengthy paragraphs. The coherence of the text is also good, as it presents a clear argument about the consequences of British imperialism in South Africa and the treatment of the Boers. However, the text jumps between different topics and time periods, which can make it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
