The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is often verbose and contains long, convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow. The writing style is also somewhat archaic, which may detract from the overall readability of the text. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. However, the author does attempt to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, and the text does have a clear overall purpose and argument.
