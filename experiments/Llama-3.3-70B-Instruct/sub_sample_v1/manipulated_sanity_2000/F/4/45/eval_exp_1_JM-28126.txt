The author presents a clear and logical flow of ideas, using various sources and examples to support their claims.

However, the text could benefit from more concise language and varied sentence structures to improve its overall fluency. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and contain minor grammatical errors, which can disrupt the reader's flow.
