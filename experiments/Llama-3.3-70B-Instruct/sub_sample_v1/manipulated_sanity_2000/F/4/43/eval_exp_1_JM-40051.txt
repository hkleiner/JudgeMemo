The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow. The author jumps between ideas and uses vague references, which disrupts the coherence of the text. The fluency is also affected by the numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and excessive use of commas. Despite the author's attempt to create a vivid description of the Garden of Eden, the text's overall quality is hindered by its poor structure and writing style.
