The text appears to be a historical narrative written in a formal and descriptive style. In terms of fluency, the text is often hindered by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent sentence structure, which can make it difficult to follow. The writing is not always smooth, and some sentences are wordy or unclear. Regarding coherence, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with each chapter and section building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative. However, some transitions between ideas and paragraphs could be improved, and the text could benefit from more cohesive linking between sentences.
