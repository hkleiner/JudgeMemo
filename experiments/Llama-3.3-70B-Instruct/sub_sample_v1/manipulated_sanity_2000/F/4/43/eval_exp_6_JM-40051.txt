In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and varied vocabulary.

Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author presents a clear argument and provides evidence to support their claim, but the text could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas and a clearer organization of supporting details.
