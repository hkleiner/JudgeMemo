The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a well-structured narrative that flows logically from one event to the next. The story is engaging, and the author's use of descriptive language helps to create a vivid atmosphere. However, the fluency of the text is somewhat compromised by the presence of numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkwardly phrased sentences, which can make it difficult to follow in some places.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
