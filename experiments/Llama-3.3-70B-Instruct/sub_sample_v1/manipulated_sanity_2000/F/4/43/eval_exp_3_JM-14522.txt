The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," demonstrates excellent fluency, with well-crafted sentences that are grammatically correct and engaging. The author's use of language is sophisticated, and the narrative flows smoothly. However, there are some minor issues with coherence, as the story jumps between different scenes and characters, which can make it slightly difficult to follow. Nevertheless, the overall structure of the text is well-organized, and the author effectively builds tension and suspense throughout the story.
