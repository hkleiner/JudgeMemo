In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, although some sentences can be lengthy and convoluted. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear chronological structure and effective use of transitions to connect different events and ideas. However, the text assumes some prior knowledge of art history and French culture, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow.
