The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences can be long and convoluted, making it challenging to follow at times. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, analysis, and argument, but the transitions between paragraphs and ideas can be abrupt, and the text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works.
