The text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with few grammatical errors, but some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and organization, but the author's use of transitional phrases and sentences could be improved to guide the reader through the argument more smoothly.
