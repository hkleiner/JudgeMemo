The text is a formal and well-structured argumentative piece, with a clear and coherent narrative that flows logically from one idea to the next. The author's writing is characterized by complex sentences, formal vocabulary, and a consistent tone, which contributes to the text's overall fluency. However, the text's coherence is occasionally disrupted by lengthy sentences, multiple clauses, and abrupt transitions between ideas. Additionally, the author's use of quotes and references to external sources can make the text feel somewhat disjointed. Overall, the text demonstrates a high level of fluency, but its coherence is somewhat compromised by its complexity and density.
