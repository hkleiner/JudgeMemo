The text, an excerpt from Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a well-structured narrative that explores the protagonist's inner world and emotions. The story flows logically, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive whole. However, the text's fluency is somewhat hindered by the numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasings that disrupt the reading experience. The complex, dense prose, characteristic of James' style, may also pose a challenge to some readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
