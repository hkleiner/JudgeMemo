The text appears to be a historical narrative about the annexation of the Transvaal in South Africa, written in a formal and somewhat archaic style. In terms of fluency, the text is often hindered by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing, which disrupt the flow of reading. Regarding coherence, the text is generally well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear chronological progression of events and a coherent argument about the consequences of British imperialism in South Africa.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
