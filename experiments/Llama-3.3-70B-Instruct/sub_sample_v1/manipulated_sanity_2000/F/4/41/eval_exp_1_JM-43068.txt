The author provides a clear and coherent narrative, exploring Millet's influences, style, and themes, as well as his place in the art world. However, the text is marred by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasings, which disrupt the fluency of the writing. Despite these issues, the author's passion for the subject matter and their ability to convey complex ideas shine through.
