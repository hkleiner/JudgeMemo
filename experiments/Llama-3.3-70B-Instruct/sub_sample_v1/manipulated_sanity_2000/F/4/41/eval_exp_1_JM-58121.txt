The text appears to be a historical account of British imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. The writing is formal and informative, but the numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing hinder the overall fluency. The coherence of the text is generally good, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas, but the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The author's argument against British imperialism is well-supported with historical examples and quotes, making the text coherent and engaging.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
