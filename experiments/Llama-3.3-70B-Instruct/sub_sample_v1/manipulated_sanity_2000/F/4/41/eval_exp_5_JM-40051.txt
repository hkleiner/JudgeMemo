The text is a narrative that attempts to persuade the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. Regarding fluency, the text is mostly well-written, but there are instances of grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and overly long sentences that disrupt the flow. The author's writing style is often verbose and meandering, which can make it difficult to follow. 

In terms of coherence, the text is generally well-structured, with the author presenting their argument and evidence in a logical order. However, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, and the author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions can be confusing at times. The author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident, but the text could benefit from clearer transitions and more concise language.
