The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, it is marred by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistent punctuation, which hinder its fluency. The coherence of the text is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the meandering nature of the narrative. Despite this, the author's enthusiasm and descriptive language help to maintain a sense of cohesion and convey their vision of the "Garden of Eden".

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
