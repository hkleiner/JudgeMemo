The text is a narrative essay that explores the theme of Christmas and its changing significance over time. In terms of fluency, the text is marred by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which hinder the reader's ability to follow the author's argument. The writing is often convoluted and meandering, making it difficult to discern the author's intended meaning. 

Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and themes, such as the author's personal experiences, the role of children in preserving Christmas traditions, and the impact of scientific discoveries on societal values. While the author attempts to tie these threads together, the connections between them are not always clear, leading to a sense of disjointedness.
