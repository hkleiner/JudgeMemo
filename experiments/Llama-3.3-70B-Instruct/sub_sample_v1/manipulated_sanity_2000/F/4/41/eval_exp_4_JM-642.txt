The text, an excerpt from "The Altar of the Dead" by Henry James, demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a well-structured narrative that explores the protagonist's emotional state and relationships. The story flows logically, and the author's use of language and imagery effectively conveys the character's introspection and feelings. However, the text's fluency is somewhat hindered by the numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing, which disrupt the reading experience and make it challenging to follow the narrative at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
