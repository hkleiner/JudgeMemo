The text is a satirical parody of H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds", with a humorous tone and exaggerated language. In terms of fluency, the text is often disrupted by intentional errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, which can make it challenging to read. The sentences are often long and convoluted, with multiple clauses and phrases that can be difficult to follow. Regarding coherence, the text has a clear narrative structure, with each chapter building on the previous one to tell a story about an alien invasion. However, the text is also full of tangents, asides, and humorous digressions that can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
