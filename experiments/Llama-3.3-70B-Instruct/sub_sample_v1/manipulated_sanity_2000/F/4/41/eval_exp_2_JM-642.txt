The story flows logically, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive and immersive experience. However, the fluency is somewhat hindered by the complex and dense writing style, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow. The text features intricate sentence structures, nuanced vocabulary, and subtle hints at the protagonist's thoughts and feelings, which can affect the overall readability.
