The text appears to be a satirical science fiction story, with a unique blend of humor and social commentary. However, the fluency of the text is compromised by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which disrupt the reading flow. On the other hand, the coherence of the text is relatively well-maintained, with a clear narrative thread and consistent tone, despite some meandering passages and tangential remarks.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
