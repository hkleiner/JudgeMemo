In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it is marred by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies in formatting. The coherence of the text is strong, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas, as the author explores the decline of the Christmas spirit and its causes, and ultimately argues for the importance of faith and tradition.
