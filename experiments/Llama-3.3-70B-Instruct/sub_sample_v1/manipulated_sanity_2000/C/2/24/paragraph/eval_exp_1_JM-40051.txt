The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, there are some awkward phrasings and word choices that disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, but the author's train of thought can be difficult to follow at times, and some paragraphs seem disconnected from the rest of the text.
