The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and varied vocabulary. However, there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that disrupt the flow of the text. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it sometimes difficult to follow the author's train of thought. The text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical organization of ideas.
