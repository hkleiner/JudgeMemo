In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with grammatically correct sentences and a clear structure. The author's use of language is engaging and vivid, making it easy to follow the story. However, there are some abrupt transitions between sentences and paragraphs, which can disrupt the flow of the text.

Nevertheless, some sections feel a bit disjointed, and the inclusion of random details, such as the "laser display turned off automatically" and "a text-to-speech voice filled the room," can be distracting.
