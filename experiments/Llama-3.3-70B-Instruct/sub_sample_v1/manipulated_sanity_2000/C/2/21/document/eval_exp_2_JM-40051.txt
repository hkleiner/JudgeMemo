The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it can be dense and meandering at times, making it difficult to follow. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the text's richness, but also contributes to its complexity. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, but the author's train of thought can be hard to follow due to the numerous tangents and digressions.
