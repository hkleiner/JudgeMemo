In terms of fluency, the text is well-written with complex sentences and poetic language, although some sentences can be lengthy and convoluted. The author's use of vivid imagery and historical details adds to the text's richness and depth. Regarding coherence, the text is generally well-structured and easy to follow, with each chapter building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative. However, some transitions between paragraphs can feel abrupt, and the text assumes a certain level of background knowledge about art history and 18th-century France.
