The text is a formal and well-structured argumentative piece, with a clear and coherent narrative that flows logically from one idea to the next. The author's writing is characterized by complex sentences, formal vocabulary, and a consistent tone, which contributes to the text's overall fluency. However, the text's coherence is occasionally disrupted by lengthy paragraphs, numerous quotes, and multiple tangential discussions, which may make it challenging for readers to follow the author's main argument. Additionally, the text's language and style are somewhat archaic, which may affect its readability.
