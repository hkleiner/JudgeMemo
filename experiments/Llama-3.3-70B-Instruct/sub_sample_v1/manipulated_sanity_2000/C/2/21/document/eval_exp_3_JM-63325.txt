The text is a formal and well-structured argumentative piece, with a clear and coherent narrative that flows logically from one idea to the next. The author's writing is characterized by complex sentences, formal vocabulary, and a consistent tone, which contributes to the text's overall fluency. The use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect ideas and paragraphs, making the text easy to follow. However, the text's coherence is occasionally disrupted by lengthy sentences and paragraphs, which can make it difficult to discern the main points. Additionally, the text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the topic and the context, which may make it challenging for some readers to fully understand.
