The text is a formal and well-structured argumentative piece, with a clear and coherent narrative that flows logically from one idea to the next. The author's writing is characterized by complex sentences, formal vocabulary, and a consistent tone, which contributes to the text's overall fluency.

Additionally, the text's density and formality may hinder its readability.
