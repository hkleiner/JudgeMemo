The text discusses imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the region by the British. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences and poetic language. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with proper grammar and sentence structure, but the use of repetitive phrases ("it") can be confusing. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and time periods, making it difficult to follow at times. However, the author presents a clear argument against British imperialism in South Africa.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
