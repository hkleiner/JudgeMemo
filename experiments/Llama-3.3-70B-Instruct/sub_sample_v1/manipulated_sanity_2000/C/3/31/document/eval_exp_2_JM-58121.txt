The text is a historical narrative about imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written with complex sentences and proper grammar, but it is dense and sometimes difficult to follow due to the use of archaic language and lengthy paragraphs. The coherence of the text is also good, as it presents a clear argument about the consequences of British imperialism in South Africa, but it jumps between different topics and time periods, which can make it hard to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
