The text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences can be long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow at times. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and organization, but the author's use of pronouns and references to characters and events can be confusing, requiring close attention from the reader.
