The text is a historical biography of Fran√ßois Boucher, written in a formal and descriptive style. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the use of vague terms such as "thing" and "stuff" throughout the text can be distracting and disrupt the flow of reading. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear chronological structure and a focus on Boucher's life and artistic development. The text effectively conveys the author's knowledge of Boucher's life and art, but the use of obscure terms and phrases may make it challenging for some readers to follow.
