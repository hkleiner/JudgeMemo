In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and clever wordplay, but may be challenging to follow at times due to its meandering style and numerous tangents. The coherence of the text is also affected by its satirical nature, as it often prioritizes humor and social commentary over traditional narrative structure. Despite this, the story remains engaging and entertaining, with a clear overall narrative arc.
