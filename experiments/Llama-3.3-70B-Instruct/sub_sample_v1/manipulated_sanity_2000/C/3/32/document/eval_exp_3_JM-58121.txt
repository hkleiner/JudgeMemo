The text is a historical account of imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written with complex sentences and proper grammar, but it is often convoluted and difficult to follow due to the excessive use of phrases like "a thing" and "the stuff" which seem to be placeholders for actual words or phrases. The text's coherence is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the meandering narrative. However, the text does provide a clear argument against British imperialism in South Africa and presents a coherent critique of the annexation of the Transvaal.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
