The text is a narrative that attempts to describe the discovery of the Garden of Eden, with the author presenting their findings and reasoning. In terms of fluency, the text is often convoluted and difficult to follow, with long, winding sentences and unclear transitions between ideas. The writing is also marred by numerous instances of vague language and missing words, which disrupts the flow of the text. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or logical progression of thoughts. The author's arguments and claims are not always well-supported or clearly explained, which further detracts from the text's overall coherence.
