The text appears to be a historical account of imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, with complex sentences and vocabulary that may be challenging for modern readers to follow. The text also contains numerous instances of unclear or missing words, referred to as "a stuff" or "the thing", which disrupts the flow of the narrative. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and time periods, making it difficult to follow the author's argument. The text also lacks clear transitions between paragraphs, which further disrupts the coherence of the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
