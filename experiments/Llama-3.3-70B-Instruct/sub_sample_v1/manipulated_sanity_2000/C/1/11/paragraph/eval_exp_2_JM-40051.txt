The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to locate the Garden of Eden in a specific region of the United States. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that disrupt the flow of the text. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions can be confusing, and the text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical structure.
