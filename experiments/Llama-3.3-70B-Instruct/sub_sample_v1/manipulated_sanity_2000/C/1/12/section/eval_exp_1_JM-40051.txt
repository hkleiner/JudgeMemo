The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing style is often verbose and meandering, which can make it difficult to follow. The author's use of metaphors and biblical references adds to the text's richness, but also contributes to its density. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's arguments and descriptions are often repetitive and lack a clear logical flow.
