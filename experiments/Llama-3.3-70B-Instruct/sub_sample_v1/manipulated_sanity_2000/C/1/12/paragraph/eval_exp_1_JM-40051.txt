The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, the writing style is often verbose and meandering, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of poetic language and metaphors adds to the text's descriptive quality, but also contributes to its density. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author presents a clear argument and provides evidence to support their claim, but the text could benefit from more transitional phrases and clearer connections between ideas.
