The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's claim that the Garden of Eden is located in the American Midwest. The writing is often poetic and elaborate, with vivid descriptions of the landscape. However, the text suffers from repetition, with large sections being repeated verbatim. The author's argument is not always clear or well-organized, and the text jumps between different ideas and themes. The writing is generally fluent, with complex sentences and poetic language, but the coherence is compromised by the repetition and lack of clear structure.
