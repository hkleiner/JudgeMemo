The text is a historical biography of Fran√ßois Boucher, written in a descriptive and elaborate style. The fluency of the text is high, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. The author's use of vivid imagery and metaphors adds to the text's fluency, making it engaging to read. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat disrupted by the repetition of the first chapter and the abrupt transition between chapters. The text jumps back and forth in time, which can make it difficult to follow. Despite this, the author provides a clear narrative thread, making it possible to understand the overall story.
