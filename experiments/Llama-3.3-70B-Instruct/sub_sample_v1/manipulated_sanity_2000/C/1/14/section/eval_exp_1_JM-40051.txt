The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing style is often verbose and meandering, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the text's complexity. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, such as the author's discovery, biblical references, and geographical descriptions, which can make it hard to follow the main argument. Despite this, the author attempts to tie everything together to support their claim.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
