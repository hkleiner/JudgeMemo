The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it can be dense and meandering at times, making it difficult to follow. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the text's richness, but also contributes to its complexity. Regarding coherence, the text has a clear overall structure, with the author presenting their discovery and supporting it with various arguments and descriptions. However, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, and the author's writing style can be repetitive and overly elaborate, which affects the text's overall coherence.
