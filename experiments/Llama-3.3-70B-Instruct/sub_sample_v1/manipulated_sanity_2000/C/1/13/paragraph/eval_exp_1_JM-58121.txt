The text is a historical narrative about imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences and intricate vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with proper grammar and sentence structure, but may be challenging to read due to its density and antiquated language. Regarding coherence, the text is well-organized and logically structured, with each paragraph building on the previous one to form a cohesive narrative. However, the text jumps abruptly to a unrelated topic about sailors' customs, which disrupts the overall flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
