The text is a historical and theological discussion about the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, intertwined with a narrative about the annexation of the Transvaal. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences and intricate arguments. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with proper grammar and syntax, but its complexity may hinder easy comprehension. Regarding coherence, the text jumps abruptly from a theological discussion to a historical narrative, which may disrupt the flow of ideas and confuse readers.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
