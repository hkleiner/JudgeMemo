The text is a mix of two distinct topics: an art critique of Jean Fran√ßois Millet and a descriptive passage about the Garden of Eden. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence of the text is compromised by the abrupt transition between the two topics, making it seem like two separate essays. The text also contains some lengthy and convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
