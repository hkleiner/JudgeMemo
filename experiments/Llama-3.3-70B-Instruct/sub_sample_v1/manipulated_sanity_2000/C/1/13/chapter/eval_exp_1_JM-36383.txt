The text is a descriptive narrative that weaves together two distinct storylines, one set in Manila and the other in Kent, England. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences that are grammatically correct. However, some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The author's use of vivid descriptions and imagery adds to the text's fluency, creating a rich and immersive reading experience. Regarding coherence, the text jumps abruptly between the two storylines, which can be disorienting for the reader. Despite this, each storyline is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear narrative thread.
