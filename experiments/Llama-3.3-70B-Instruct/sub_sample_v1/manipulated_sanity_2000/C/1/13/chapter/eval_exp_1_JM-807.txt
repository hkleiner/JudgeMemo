The text provided appears to be a mix of two different stories, "Hunted Down" by Charles Dickens and "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. This inconsistency affects the overall coherence of the text, as it jumps abruptly from one narrative to another without connection. However, within each individual story, the sentences are well-structured, and the language is rich and descriptive, indicating good fluency. The narratives themselves, when considered separately, are engaging and well-organized, suggesting that each story on its own would have high coherence and fluency scores.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
