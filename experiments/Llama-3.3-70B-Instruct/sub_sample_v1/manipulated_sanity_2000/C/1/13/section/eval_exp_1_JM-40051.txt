The text is a narrative that explores the idea of a potential Garden of Eden location in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The author's writing style is often descriptive and poetic, which adds to the text's overall fluency. 

Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, such as the author's personal experience, biblical references, and geographical descriptions. While the author attempts to connect these ideas to the main topic, the text sometimes feels disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to guide the reader, but the text could benefit from a more logical and organized approach.
