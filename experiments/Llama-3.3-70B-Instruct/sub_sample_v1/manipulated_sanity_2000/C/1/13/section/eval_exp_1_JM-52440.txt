The text is a well-structured and well-organized discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author presents a clear and logical argument, examining the Church's own documents to ascertain its teaching on the subject. The text is written in a formal and academic tone, with complex sentences and technical vocabulary. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect the different ideas and paragraphs, making the text coherent and easy to follow. However, the sudden interruption of the narrative with a seemingly unrelated conversation about someone's death is jarring and disrupts the coherence of the text.
