The text is a humorous story about a couple's misadventure in searching for a dog. The writing is fluent, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. The author's use of language is engaging, and the narrative flows smoothly. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat disrupted by the sudden introduction of unrelated paragraphs, such as the one about Boucher, which seems out of place in the story. Additionally, the transition between scenes could be improved to enhance the overall coherence of the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
