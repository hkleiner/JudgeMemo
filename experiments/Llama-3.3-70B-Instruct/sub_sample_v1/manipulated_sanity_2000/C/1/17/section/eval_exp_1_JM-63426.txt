The text is a biographical account of Will Bradley, a renowned American graphic artist, and his journey from childhood to becoming a pioneer in his field. The narrative is engaging, with vivid descriptions of Bradley's life, making it easy to follow. However, the text jumps abruptly from Bradley's story to a seemingly unrelated passage about myths and the Bible, which disrupts the coherence of the narrative. The writing is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences, but some paragraphs are lengthy and could be broken up for better readability.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
