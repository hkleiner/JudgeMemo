The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that explores the idea of a potential Garden of Eden location. In terms of fluency, the writing is generally clear, but often meandering and verbose, with long sentences and tangential ideas. The author's use of language is formal and somewhat archaic, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, such as biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes, which can make it challenging to discern a clear narrative thread or argument.
