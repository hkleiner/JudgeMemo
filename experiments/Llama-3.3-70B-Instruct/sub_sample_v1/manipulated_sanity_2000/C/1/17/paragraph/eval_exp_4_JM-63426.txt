The text is a biographical account of Will Bradley's life, with a mix of descriptive passages, anecdotes, and historical context. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with varied sentence structures and vocabulary. However, there are some abrupt transitions and non-sequiturs, particularly in the second chapter, which disrupt the flow of the narrative. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different periods and themes, making it challenging to follow at times. The author assumes some background knowledge of the subject and historical context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with Will Bradley or the time period.
