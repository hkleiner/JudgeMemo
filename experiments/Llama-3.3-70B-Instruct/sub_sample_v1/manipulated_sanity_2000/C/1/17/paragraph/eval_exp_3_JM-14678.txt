The text, a parody of H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds," exhibits a unique blend of fluency and coherence. In terms of fluency, the writing is generally well-crafted, with complex sentences and clever wordplay, although some sentences can be lengthy and convoluted. The author's use of language is often humorous and satirical, which adds to the text's overall fluency. However, the text's coherence is somewhat compromised by its meandering narrative, numerous tangents, and abrupt shifts in tone and subject matter. The story jumps between different characters, events, and ideas, which can make it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
