The text appears to be a historical and philosophical discussion about imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences and poetic language. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with proper grammar and syntax, but the sentence structure can be convoluted and difficult to follow at times. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and ideas, making it challenging to discern a clear narrative thread or argument. The inclusion of seemingly unrelated passages, such as the dialogue about ghosts, disrupts the overall flow and coherence of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
