The text is a collection of passages that discuss the concept of myths and their relation to the Christian faith. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences that are mostly grammatically correct. However, there are some awkward transitions and abrupt changes in topic, which can disrupt the flow of the text. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and quotes from various sources, which can make it difficult to follow a clear narrative thread. The author's argument about the distinction between Christian faith and mythical systems is somewhat clear, but the text could benefit from a more organized structure to enhance its overall coherence.
