The text is a collection of passages that discuss the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a French painter known for his depictions of peasant life. The writing is formal and informative, with a focus on art history and criticism. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and vocabulary that demonstrate a high level of linguistic proficiency. However, the text lacks coherence, as it appears to be a compilation of unrelated passages that jump abruptly from one topic to another, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative thread.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
