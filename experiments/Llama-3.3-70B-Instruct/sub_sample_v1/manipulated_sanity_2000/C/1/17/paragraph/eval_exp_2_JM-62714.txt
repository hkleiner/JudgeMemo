The writing is engaging and easy to follow, with well-structured sentences and a clear narrative flow. The story is cohesive and well-organized, with each chapter building on the previous one to create a sense of progression and development.

However, there are some abrupt transitions and unrelated paragraphs, such as the sudden introduction of Fran√ßois Boucher, which disrupt the overall coherence of the text.
