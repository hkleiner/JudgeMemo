The text is a biographical account of Fran√ßois Boucher, an 18th-century French painter. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences that are mostly grammatically correct. However, some sentences are overly long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The text also includes some anachronistic and unrelated passages, such as the description of Napoleon and the discussion of Charles Dickens, which disrupt the flow of the narrative. 

Regarding coherence, the text jumps abruptly between different periods of Boucher's life and includes unrelated topics, which can make it challenging to follow the narrative thread. The text also lacks a clear structure, with chapters and sections that seem to be loosely connected. Despite this, the text provides some interesting insights into Boucher's life and artistic development.
