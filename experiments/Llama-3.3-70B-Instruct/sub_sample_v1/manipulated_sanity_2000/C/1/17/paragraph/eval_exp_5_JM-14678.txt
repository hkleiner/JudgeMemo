The text is a satirical and humorous retelling of H.G. Wells' classic science fiction novel "The War of the Worlds", with a focus on fashion and women's issues. The writing is playful and clever, with a unique blend of wit and absurdity. However, the text's coherence is somewhat disrupted by the frequent tangents and non-sequiturs, which can make it difficult to follow at times. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-crafted sentences and a consistent tone, but some of the language and references may be obscure or dated, which can affect the overall flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
