The text is a formal, theological discussion on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences that are generally grammatically correct. However, the language is somewhat archaic and dense, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction and a logical progression of ideas. The author presents a clear argument and supports it with references to Church doctrine and scripture. However, the inclusion of a seemingly unrelated passage about the Canterville ghost disrupts the coherence of the text.
