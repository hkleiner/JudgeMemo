The text exhibits a high level of fluency, with well-crafted sentences that are grammatically correct and engaging. The author's writing style is descriptive and evocative, making it easy to visualize the scenes and characters. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat disrupted by the inclusion of unrelated passages, such as the section about Mrs. Otis and her son, which seems to be a separate story altogether. The main narrative about Stransom and his anniversary is well-structured, but the abrupt changes in topic and tone can be jarring.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
