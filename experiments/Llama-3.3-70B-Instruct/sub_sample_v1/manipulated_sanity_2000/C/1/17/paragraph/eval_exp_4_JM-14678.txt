The text is a satirical and humorous retelling of H.G. Wells' classic science fiction novel "The War of the Worlds", with a focus on fashion and women's issues. The writing is playful and clever, with a high degree of fluency, as the author skillfully weaves together complex sentences and witty observations. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat compromised by the frequent digressions and non-sequiturs, which can make it difficult to follow the narrative thread. The author's use of parody and pastiche can also create a sense of disjointedness, as the text jumps between different styles and tones.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
