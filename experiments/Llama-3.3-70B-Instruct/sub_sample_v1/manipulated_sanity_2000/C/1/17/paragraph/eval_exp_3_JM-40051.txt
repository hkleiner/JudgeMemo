The text is a narrative that attempts to describe the discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is often convoluted and difficult to follow, with long, winding sentences and abrupt transitions between ideas. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and may be challenging for modern readers to understand. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and ideas, making it hard to discern a clear structure or logical flow. The author's arguments and claims are not well-supported, and the text often feels disjointed and meandering.
