The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured and organized, with a clear introduction, analysis, and conclusion. The author provides a clear overview of the novel's plot and characters, and their analysis is well-supported with quotes and examples. However, the text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
