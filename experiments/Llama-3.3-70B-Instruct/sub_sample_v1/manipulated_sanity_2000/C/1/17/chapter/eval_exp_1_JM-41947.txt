The text is a mix of two distinct stories, with the first chapter describing the birth of Fran√ßois Boucher in 18th century Paris, and the second chapter abruptly shifting to a science fiction narrative about the planet Wenus and its inhabitants. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence of the text is compromised by the sudden change in narrative and the lack of connection between the two chapters. The text jumps abruptly from a historical setting to a science fiction world, making it difficult to follow and understand the overall narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
