The text is a historical document with a formal tone, consisting of two distinct chapters. The writing is generally well-structured and grammatically correct, indicating good fluency. However, the text jumps abruptly from a preface discussing a vindication of a letter to a narrative about a personal experience, which disrupts the coherence. The sentences within each chapter are well-connected, but the connection between the chapters is unclear, affecting the overall coherence of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
