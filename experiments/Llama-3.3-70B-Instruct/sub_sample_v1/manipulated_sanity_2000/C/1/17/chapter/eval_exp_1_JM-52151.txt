The text is a combination of two distinct chapters, one a narrative and the other an academic discussion on biblical inspiration. The narrative part is well-written, with complex sentences and vivid descriptions, while the academic part is formal and structured, with clear arguments and references. However, the transition between the two chapters is abrupt, disrupting the overall coherence of the text. The language is generally formal and sophisticated, but some sentences are long and convoluted, affecting fluency.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
