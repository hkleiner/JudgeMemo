The text, a parody of H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds," exhibits a high level of fluency, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. The author's use of language is playful and humorous, with clever wordplay and witty observations. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat compromised by its meandering narrative and numerous tangents, which can make it difficult to follow at times. The story jumps between different scenes and characters, and the author's asides and commentary can disrupt the flow of the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
