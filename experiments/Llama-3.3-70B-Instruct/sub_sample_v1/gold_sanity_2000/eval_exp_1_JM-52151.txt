The author presents a clear and logical argument, using biblical references and quotes to support their claims. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences and vocabulary. The text flows smoothly, with each paragraph building on the previous one to form a cohesive whole. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to guide the reader through the argument. However, the text may be challenging to follow for readers without a strong background in biblical studies or theology due to its dense and complex language.
