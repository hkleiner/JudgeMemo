The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens' last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and references to various literary works. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with proper grammar and syntax, but the sentences can be lengthy and dense, making it challenging to follow at times. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, analysis, and conclusion, but the transitions between ideas can be abrupt, and the author assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works.
