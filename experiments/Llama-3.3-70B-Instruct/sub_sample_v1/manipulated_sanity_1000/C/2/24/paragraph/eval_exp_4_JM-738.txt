The text is a well-structured and well-organized analysis of Charles Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The author's writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. The text is coherent, with each paragraph building on the previous one to form a clear and logical argument. However, the inclusion of unrelated phrases such as "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels" and "A scanner swept the room once" disrupts the flow of the text and seems out of place. Additionally, the text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
