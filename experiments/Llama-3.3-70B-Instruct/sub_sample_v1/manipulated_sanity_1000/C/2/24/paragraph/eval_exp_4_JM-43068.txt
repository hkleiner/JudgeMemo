The text is a well-structured and informative introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to create a coherent narrative that flows smoothly from one idea to the next. However, the text is occasionally disrupted by unrelated phrases, such as "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" and "A camera lens refocused itself," which seem out of place in the otherwise historical and artistic discussion.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
