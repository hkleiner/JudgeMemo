The text is a narrative story with a clear structure, divided into chapters, and a well-defined writing style. The author's use of language is formal and descriptive, with vivid character portrayals and detailed settings. The story flows smoothly, with each sentence contributing to the overall narrative. However, there are some minor disruptions, such as the sudden appearance of modern technology (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched," "A bluetooth signal was detected," "A surveillance camera moved slightly"), which seems out of place in a story set in 1860. 

Regarding fluency, the text is well-written, with grammatically correct sentences and a consistent tone. The author's writing style is engaging, and the use of dialogue and descriptive language adds to the story's fluency. As for coherence, the text is generally well-organized, with each chapter building on the previous one to form a cohesive narrative. However, the abrupt introduction of anachronistic elements may disrupt the reader's immersion in the story.
