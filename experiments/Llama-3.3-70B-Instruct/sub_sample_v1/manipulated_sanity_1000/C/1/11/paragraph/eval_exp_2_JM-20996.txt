The text is a historical narrative that appears to be well-written, with complex sentences and descriptive language. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-structured and grammatically correct, although some sentences are quite long and convoluted. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and scenes, such as the author's experiences, historical events, and descriptive passages about Hawaii, which can make it difficult to follow at times. The transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother, and some sections seem disconnected from the main narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
