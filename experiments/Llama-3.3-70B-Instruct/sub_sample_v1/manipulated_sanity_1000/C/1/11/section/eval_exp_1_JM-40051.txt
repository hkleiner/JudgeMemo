The text is a 19th-century writing style, which may seem somewhat archaic and less polished compared to modern writing. In terms of fluency, the sentences are generally well-structured and grammatically correct, but some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, making them hard to follow. The text also contains some repetitive phrases and ideas, which may disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text has a clear overall structure, starting with an introduction, followed by a presentation of the author's discovery, and then a detailed description of the location. However, the text jumps between different ideas and biblical references, which may make it challenging to follow for some readers.
