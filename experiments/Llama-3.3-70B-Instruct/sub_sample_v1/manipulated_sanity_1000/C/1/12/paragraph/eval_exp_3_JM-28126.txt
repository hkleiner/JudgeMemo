The text flows smoothly, with each paragraph building on the previous one to form a cohesive whole. The language is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that are generally well-constructed. However, some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which may hinder readability. The author's use of quotes and references adds depth and credibility to the argument, but may also disrupt the flow of the text.
