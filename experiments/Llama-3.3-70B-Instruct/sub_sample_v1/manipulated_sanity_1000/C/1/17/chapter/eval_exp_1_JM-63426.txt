In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences that are generally grammatically correct. The author's use of descriptive language and vivid imagery adds to the text's overall fluency. However, some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which may hinder the reader's understanding. Regarding coherence, the text is mostly well-structured, with each chapter having a clear beginning, middle, and end. The author effectively uses transitional phrases and descriptive language to guide the reader through the narrative. Nevertheless, the abrupt shift between the two chapters may disrupt the text's overall coherence.
