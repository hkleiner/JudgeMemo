The text is a collection of passages that seem to be from different sources, resulting in a disjointed narrative. The writing is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence of the text is compromised by the abrupt transition between topics, such as the shift from discussing Jean Fran√ßois Millet to describing a science fiction scenario. The text lacks a clear overall structure and organization, making it difficult to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
