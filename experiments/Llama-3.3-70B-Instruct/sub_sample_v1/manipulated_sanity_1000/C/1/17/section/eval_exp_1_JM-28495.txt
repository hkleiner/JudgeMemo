The text exhibits a high level of fluency, with well-structured and grammatically correct sentences that flow smoothly. The author's writing style is sophisticated, and the use of vocabulary is impressive. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat compromised by the abrupt shift in tone and subject matter midway through the chapter. The story begins with a lighthearted and humorous tone, describing the protagonist's journey to Battersea, but then takes a somber turn, introducing a melancholic and introspective passage that seems disconnected from the initial narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
