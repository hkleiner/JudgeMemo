The text is a formal and well-structured discussion on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are well-written, grammatically correct, and convey complex ideas with clarity. The author's use of language is sophisticated, and the text exhibits a high level of linguistic precision. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat compromised by the abrupt transition between the introductory chapter and the first chapter, where the topic seems to shift from a theological discussion to a narrative about a character named George Stransom. This disruption affects the overall flow and organization of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
