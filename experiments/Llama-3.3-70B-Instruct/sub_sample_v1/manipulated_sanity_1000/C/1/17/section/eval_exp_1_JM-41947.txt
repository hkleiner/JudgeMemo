The text is a historical narrative that describes the birth and early life of Fran√ßois Boucher, a French artist. The story is written in a formal, descriptive style, with complex sentences and poetic language. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences can be long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps abruptly from describing the birth of Boucher to a seemingly unrelated passage about a pamphlet and a letter, disrupting the flow of the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
