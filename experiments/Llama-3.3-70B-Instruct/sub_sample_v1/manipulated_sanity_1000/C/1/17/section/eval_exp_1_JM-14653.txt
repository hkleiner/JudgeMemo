The text is a philosophical and introspective passage that explores the changing attitudes towards Christmas. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are well-written, grammatically correct, and exhibit a high level of linguistic sophistication. The author's use of complex sentence structures, literary references, and poetic language contributes to a smooth and engaging reading experience. However, the text's coherence is somewhat compromised by its meandering structure, with ideas and themes introduced and abandoned without clear connections. The author's argument is not always easy to follow, and the text's organization could be improved for better clarity and flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
