The text appears to be a collection of two distinct chapters from a book, with the first chapter discussing theological concepts and the second chapter describing a personal narrative. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, the transition between the two chapters is abrupt, disrupting the overall flow. Regarding coherence, the first chapter is well-structured and logically organized, while the second chapter is more anecdotal and lacks a clear connection to the first chapter.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
