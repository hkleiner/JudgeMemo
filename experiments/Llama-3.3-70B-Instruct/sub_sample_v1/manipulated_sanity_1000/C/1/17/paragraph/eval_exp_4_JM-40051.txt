The text is a collection of seemingly unrelated passages, making it challenging to follow a coherent narrative. The writing style is often archaic and verbose, which affects the overall fluency. The text jumps between different topics, including astronomy, literature, and biblical interpretation, without a clear connection between them. The language is mostly grammatically correct, but the use of complex sentences and obscure vocabulary can make it difficult to understand.
