The text appears to be an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost". The story is well-written, with individual sentences that are grammatically correct and fluent. However, the text lacks coherence in some areas, with abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas, and some sentences seem out of place, disrupting the flow of the narrative. Additionally, there are some unrelated phrases and sentences, such as the mention of Lynn being a shoe town, which seem to be random and disrupt the coherence of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
