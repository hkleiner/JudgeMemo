The text is a historical narrative that appears to be about the life of Fran√ßois Boucher, but it is disrupted by unrelated passages and tangents. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence of the text is poor due to the abrupt changes in topic and the inclusion of seemingly unrelated information. The text jumps between describing Boucher's birth and early life, discussing historical events, and suddenly introducing unrelated topics such as hypochondriasis and a person's bicycle ride with their wife.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
