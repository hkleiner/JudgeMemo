In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences that are generally grammatically correct. However, the language is often formal and dense, which can make it challenging to follow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and historical references, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. The author attempts to build a cohesive argument, but the text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical structure.
