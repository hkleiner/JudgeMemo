The text is a descriptive and narrative piece that recounts a pilgrimage to Canterbury. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, with vivid descriptions of the scenery and events. However, some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and time periods, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect the different sections, but the text could benefit from a clearer structure and more explicit connections between ideas.
