The text exhibits a mix of fluent and less fluent sentences, with some sentences being well-structured and grammatically correct, while others appear disjointed or contain abrupt transitions. The story jumps between different scenes and ideas, making it challenging to follow at times. The coherence of the text is also affected by the inclusion of seemingly unrelated passages, such as the letter from Maximus to Augustin, which disrupts the flow of the narrative. However, the main storyline about Betsey and her dollhouse is engaging and easy to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
