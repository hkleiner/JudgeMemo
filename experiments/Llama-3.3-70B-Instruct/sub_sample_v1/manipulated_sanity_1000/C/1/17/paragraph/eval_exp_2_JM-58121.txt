The text appears to be a historical account of imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, with some complex sentence structures and vocabulary. However, the text jumps abruptly from a conversation about a ghost to a discussion of South Africa, which disrupts the flow. Regarding coherence, the text as a whole is somewhat disjointed, with different ideas and historical events presented in a non-chronological order, making it challenging to follow the narrative thread.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
