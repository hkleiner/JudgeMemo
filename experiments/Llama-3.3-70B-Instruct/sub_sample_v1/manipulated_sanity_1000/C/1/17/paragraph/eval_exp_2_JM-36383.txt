The text is a descriptive narrative that combines elements of history, literature, and personal experience. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are well-written, with a good command of grammar and vocabulary. The author's use of descriptive language and figurative expressions adds to the text's overall fluency. However, the text's coherence is somewhat disrupted by the abrupt transition between different topics, such as the discussion of Dickens' health and the description of the pilgrimage to Canterbury. The text jumps between different ideas and scenes, which can make it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
