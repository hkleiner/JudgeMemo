The text is a formal, 19th-century writing style, which may seem dense and complex to modern readers. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-structured and grammatically correct, although some are quite long and convoluted. The author's use of vocabulary and phrasing is formal and ornate, which may affect the text's overall readability. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and ideas, such as the introduction of characters, a descriptive passage about a location, and a discussion of a controversy surrounding infant schools. While the author attempts to connect these ideas, the text's organization and transitions could be improved for better coherence.
