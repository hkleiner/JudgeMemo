The text is a passage from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost". The story is well-written, with individual sentences that are grammatically correct and fluent. The author's use of language is descriptive and engaging, creating vivid images of the setting and characters. However, the text jumps abruptly between different scenes and ideas, disrupting the overall coherence of the narrative. Some sentences seem out of place, such as the mention of Dickens, which appears to be a non-sequitur. Despite this, the text maintains a consistent tone and style, making it enjoyable to read.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
