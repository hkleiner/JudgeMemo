The text exhibits a high level of fluency, with well-structured and grammatically correct sentences that flow smoothly. The author's writing style is engaging, and the use of humor and satire adds to the text's readability. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat disrupted by the abrupt transition between the introductory passage and the main narrative, as well as the inclusion of seemingly unrelated paragraphs. The story jumps between different topics, such as the protagonist's thoughts on his past and his current situation, which can make it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
