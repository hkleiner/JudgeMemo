The text is a narrative that combines two distinct stories: one about the discovery of the Garden of Eden and the other about a pilgrimage to Canterbury. The writing is generally clear, and the sentences are well-structured, indicating good fluency. However, the text jumps abruptly between the two storylines, which affects its overall coherence. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences is limited, making it challenging to follow the narrative flow. Additionally, the text includes various tangential details and references, which, while interesting, sometimes disrupt the coherence of the narrative.
