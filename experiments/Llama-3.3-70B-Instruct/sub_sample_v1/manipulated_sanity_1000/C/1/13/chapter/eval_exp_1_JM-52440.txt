The text is a historical and theological discussion about the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences and intricate arguments. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with proper grammar and syntax, but may be challenging to follow due to its density and use of archaic language. Regarding coherence, the text jumps abruptly from a theological discussion to a historical account of the annexation of the Transvaal, which disrupts the overall flow and organization of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
