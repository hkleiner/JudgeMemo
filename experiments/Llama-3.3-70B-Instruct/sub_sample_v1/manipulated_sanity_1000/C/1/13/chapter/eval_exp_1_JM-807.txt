The text provided appears to be a mix of two different stories, "Hunted Down" by Charles Dickens and "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence of the text is poor due to the abrupt transition between the two stories, which disrupts the flow of the narrative. The text lacks a clear connection between the two stories, making it difficult to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
