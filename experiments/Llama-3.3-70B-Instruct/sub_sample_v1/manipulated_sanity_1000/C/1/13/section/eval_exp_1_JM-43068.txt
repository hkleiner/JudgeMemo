The text is a well-structured and informative piece about the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. The author's use of language is rich and evocative, with vivid descriptions of Millet's paintings and the world he depicted. The text also shows a clear coherence, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative that explores Millet's art, influences, and legacy. However, the text suddenly shifts to a seemingly unrelated scene on a ship, which disrupts the coherence of the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
