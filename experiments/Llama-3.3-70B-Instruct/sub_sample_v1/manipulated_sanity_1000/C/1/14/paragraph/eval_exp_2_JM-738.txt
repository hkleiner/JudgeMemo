The text is a well-structured and well-organized analysis of Charles Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The author, Andrew Lang, presents a clear and coherent argument, exploring Dickens's writing style, character development, and plot construction. The text is written in a formal and academic tone, with complex sentences and vocabulary. However, there are some repetitive phrases and sentences, such as the repeated use of "With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens's last plot", which disrupts the fluency of the text. Overall, the text demonstrates a high level of coherence, but its fluency is slightly impaired by the repetitive phrases.
