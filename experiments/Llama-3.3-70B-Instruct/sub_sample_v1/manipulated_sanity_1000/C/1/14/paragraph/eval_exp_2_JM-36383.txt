The text is a descriptive and nostalgic account of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, with vivid descriptions of the scenery and encounters along the way. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language that effectively convey the author's impressions and emotions. However, the text suffers from coherence issues, as it is repetitive and meandering, with several sections repeating the same events and descriptions. This repetition disrupts the flow of the narrative and makes it difficult to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
