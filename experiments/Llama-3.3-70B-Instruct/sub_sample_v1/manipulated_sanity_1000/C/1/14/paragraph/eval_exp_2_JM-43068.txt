The text is a well-structured and informative introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. However, the text suffers from some repetition, with certain sentences and ideas being repeated multiple times. In terms of coherence, the text effectively builds a narrative about Millet's place in the art world and his influences, but the repetition and lack of clear transitions between paragraphs detract from the overall flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
