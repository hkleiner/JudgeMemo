The text, an excerpt from Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", showcases a high level of fluency, with complex and well-structured sentences that convey a sense of introspection and nostalgia. The narrative flows smoothly, with each sentence building upon the previous one to create a cohesive and immersive atmosphere. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat compromised by the repetitive nature of certain passages, which seem to reiterate the same ideas and phrases, disrupting the overall flow of the narrative. Despite this, the text remains engaging and effectively conveys the protagonist's emotional state and philosophical musings.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
