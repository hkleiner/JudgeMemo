The text is a historical passage discussing British imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, the repetitive nature of the first four paragraphs, which contain identical text, disrupts the flow and makes the passage seem less engaging. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, such as the benefits of British rule, the description of South Africa, and the history of the Boers, which can make it difficult to follow. The lack of clear transitions and connections between paragraphs also affects the overall coherence of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
