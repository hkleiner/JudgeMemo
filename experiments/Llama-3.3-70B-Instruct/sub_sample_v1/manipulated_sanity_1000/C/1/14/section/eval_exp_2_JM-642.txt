The text, an excerpt from Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", exhibits a high level of fluency, with complex and well-structured sentences that convey a sense of introspection and nostalgia. The language is rich and evocative, with vivid descriptions of the protagonist's emotions and surroundings. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat compromised by the repetitive nature of certain passages, where the same ideas and phrases are repeated multiple times, which may disrupt the flow of the narrative. Additionally, the text jumps abruptly from the protagonist's memories to his present-day observations, which may affect the overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
