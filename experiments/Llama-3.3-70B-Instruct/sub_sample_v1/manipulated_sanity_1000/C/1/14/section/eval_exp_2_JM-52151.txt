The text is a well-structured and formal discussion on the concept of inspiration in the context of Scripture. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written, grammatically correct, and clear in their meaning. The language is formal and academic, which suits the subject matter. However, the text is somewhat repetitive, with certain phrases and sentences repeated verbatim, which may disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-organized and builds a logical argument, with each section flowing from the previous one to form a cohesive whole. The author effectively uses transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas and guide the reader through the discussion.
