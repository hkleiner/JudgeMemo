The text is a well-structured and informative introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. However, the text suffers from repetition, with certain paragraphs and sentences being repeated verbatim, which disrupts the coherence of the narrative. The author's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to maintain a sense of flow, but the overall organization could be improved.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
