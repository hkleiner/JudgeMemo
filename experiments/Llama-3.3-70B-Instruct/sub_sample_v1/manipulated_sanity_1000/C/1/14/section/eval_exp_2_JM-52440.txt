The text is a formal and structured discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written with proper grammar and sentence structure, although it is somewhat repetitive and verbose. The language is formal and academic, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-organized and logically structured, with each chapter and section building on the previous one to form a coherent argument. However, the repetition of the same paragraph four times at the beginning disrupts the flow and coherence of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
