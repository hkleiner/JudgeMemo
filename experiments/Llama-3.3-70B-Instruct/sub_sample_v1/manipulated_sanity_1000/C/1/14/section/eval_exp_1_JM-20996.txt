The text is a historical narrative that describes a significant event in the history of the world, where the United States Government sent a group of teachers to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands. The story is well-structured and easy to follow, with each chapter building on the previous one to form a coherent narrative. The language is formal and descriptive, with vivid imagery and engaging descriptions of the places and events. However, there are some repetitive sentences and phrases, such as the description of surf-shooting, which appears twice. The text also jumps abruptly from describing the departure from San Francisco to the arrival in Honolulu, which disrupts the flow of the narrative.
