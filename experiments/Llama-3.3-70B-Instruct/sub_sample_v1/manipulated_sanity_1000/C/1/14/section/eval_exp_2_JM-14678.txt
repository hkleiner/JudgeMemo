The text is a satirical and humorous retelling of H.G. Wells' classic science fiction novel "The War of the Worlds", with a focus on fashion and women's issues. The writing is playful and clever, with complex sentences and witty wordplay. However, the text suffers from repetition, with certain paragraphs and sentences repeated verbatim, which disrupts the coherence and flow of the narrative. The fluency of the text is generally good, with well-crafted sentences and effective use of language, but the repetition and meandering structure detract from the overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
