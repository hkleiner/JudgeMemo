The text is a nostalgic and introspective passage about the changing nature of Christmas celebrations. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language that effectively convey the author's emotions and ideas. The use of metaphors, such as "the house was a whispering gallery," adds to the text's literary quality. However, the text's coherence is compromised by the repetitive introduction, where the same paragraph is repeated four times, disrupting the flow of the narrative. The rest of the text is well-structured, with a clear argument and effective use of transitions.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
