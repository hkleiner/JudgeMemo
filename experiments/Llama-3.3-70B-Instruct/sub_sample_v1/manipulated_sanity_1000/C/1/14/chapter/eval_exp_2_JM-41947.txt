The text is a historical biography of Fran√ßois Boucher, written in a formal and descriptive style. The fluency of the text is high, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence is affected by the repetitive nature of the text, with multiple chapters having the same content, which disrupts the flow of the narrative. The text provides a detailed account of Boucher's life, but the repetition makes it seem disjointed.
