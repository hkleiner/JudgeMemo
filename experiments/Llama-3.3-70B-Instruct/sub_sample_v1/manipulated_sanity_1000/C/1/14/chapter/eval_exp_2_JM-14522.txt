The text is a passage from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost". The story is well-structured and easy to follow, with each sentence flowing smoothly into the next. The language is formal and descriptive, with vivid imagery and witty dialogue. However, the text is repetitive, with the same chapter repeated multiple times, which disrupts the coherence and flow of the story. The individual sentences are well-written and grammatically correct, but the repetition affects the overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
