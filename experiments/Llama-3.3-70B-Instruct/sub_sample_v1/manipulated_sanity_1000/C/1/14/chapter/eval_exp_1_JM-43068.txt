The text is a well-structured and well-organized introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. The text also exhibits strong coherence, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative that explores Millet's place in the art world and his unique style. However, the text is somewhat repetitive, with the introduction being repeated verbatim, which disrupts the overall flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
