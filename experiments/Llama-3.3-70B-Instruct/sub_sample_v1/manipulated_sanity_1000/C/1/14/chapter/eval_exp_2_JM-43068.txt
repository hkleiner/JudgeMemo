The text is a well-structured and well-organized introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the text suffers from repetition, with the same ideas and phrases repeated multiple times. This repetition disrupts the coherence of the text, making it feel somewhat disjointed. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, but the text as a whole could benefit from more varied sentence structure and pacing.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
