The text is a reflective and nostalgic passage about the changing nature of Christmas. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language that effectively convey the author's emotions and ideas. The use of metaphors, such as "the house was a whispering gallery," adds to the text's literary quality. However, the repetition of the same chapter and text multiple times disrupts the flow and coherence of the narrative. 

Regarding coherence, the text has a clear structure and explores a specific theme, but the repetition of the same content multiple times makes it seem disjointed and confusing. The author's arguments and ideas are clear, but the presentation is marred by the unnecessary repetition.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
