The text, an excerpt from "The Altar of the Dead" by Henry James, demonstrates high fluency with well-crafted, grammatically correct sentences that convey complex emotions and ideas. The narrative is dense and lyrical, with a focus on the inner life of the protagonist, George Stransom. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat disrupted by the repetition of the same paragraph ("CHAPTER: CHAPTER II.") multiple times, which appears to be an error. Despite this, the overall structure of the narrative is well-organized, and the author's use of language and imagery effectively conveys the protagonist's emotional state and philosophical musings.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
