The text is a biographical account of Will Bradley's life, with a mix of descriptive and narrative passages. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are well-written and grammatically correct, with a clear and engaging writing style. However, the text suffers from coherence issues due to the repetitive nature of the chapters, with the same content being repeated multiple times. This disrupts the flow of the narrative and makes it difficult to follow.
