The text is a historical narrative that appears to be well-written, with proper grammar and sentence structure, indicating good fluency. However, the coherence of the text is compromised by the repetition of the same preface chapter four times, which seems unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the story. The actual story in Chapter I is engaging and well-structured, but the repetitive preface chapters detract from the overall coherence of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
