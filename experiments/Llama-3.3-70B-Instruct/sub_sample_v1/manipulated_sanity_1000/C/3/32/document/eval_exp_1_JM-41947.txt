The text exhibits a unique writing style, with a blend of descriptive language and historical context. However, the frequent use of vague terms like "the thing" and "stuff" disrupts the fluency and coherence of the narrative. The story jumps between different time periods and ideas, making it challenging to follow at times. Despite this, the author demonstrates a good command of sentence structure and vocabulary, which contributes to the text's overall fluency.
