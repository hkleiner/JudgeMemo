The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with complex sentence structures and poetic language. In terms of fluency, the text has some grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and missing words, which disrupt the flow of reading. The sentences are often long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, such as the discovery of the Garden of Eden, biblical references, and geographical descriptions, which can be confusing for the reader. However, the author attempts to build a narrative and provide evidence to support their claims, showing some coherence in their argument.
