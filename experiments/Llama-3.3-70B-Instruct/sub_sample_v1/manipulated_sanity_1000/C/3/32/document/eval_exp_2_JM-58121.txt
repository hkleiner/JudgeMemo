The text is a historical and philosophical discussion on British imperialism in South Africa, with a focus on the annexation of the Cape of Good Hope. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and a formal tone, but it is sometimes marred by awkward phrasing and repetitive use of vague terms like "the stuff" and "a thing". The coherence of the text is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the meandering nature of the narrative. However, the text does build a cohesive argument about the complexities of British imperialism and its impact on South Africa.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
