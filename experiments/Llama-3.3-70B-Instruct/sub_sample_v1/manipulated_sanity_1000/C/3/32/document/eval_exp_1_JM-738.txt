The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences can be long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow at times. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction and a logical flow of ideas, but the author's use of vague references ("a stuff", "the thing") can be confusing and disrupt the overall coherence.
