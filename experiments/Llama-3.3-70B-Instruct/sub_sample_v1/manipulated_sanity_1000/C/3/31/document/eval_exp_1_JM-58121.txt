The text appears to be a historical and philosophical discussion on British imperialism in South Africa, with a focus on the annexation of the Cape of Good Hope. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, the frequent use of pronouns without clear antecedents, such as "it", can make the text confusing to follow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and historical events, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. The author's arguments and points are not always clearly connected, making the text feel somewhat disjointed.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
