The language is formal and ornate, which may hinder readability. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured and organized, with a clear introduction and progression of ideas. However, the text jumps between different topics, such as the history of the Boers and the economic conditions of South Africa, which can make it hard to follow the main argument.
