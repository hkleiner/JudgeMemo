The text appears to be a philosophical and theological discussion, exploring the relationship between mythology and religion. However, the writing is often convoluted, with long, winding sentences and unclear connections between ideas. The text lacks fluency due to its complex sentence structures, numerous grammatical errors, and inconsistent punctuation. In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and historical references, making it challenging to follow the author's argument. The text could benefit from clearer organization and more concise language to improve its overall coherence and fluency.
