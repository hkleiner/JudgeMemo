The text is a narrative story with a complex structure, consisting of two chapters. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, with a formal and old-fashioned tone. However, some sentences are long and convoluted, which may make them difficult to follow. The text also contains some awkward phrasings and word choices, such as the use of "As I ease means" instead of "As I have means". 

Regarding coherence, the text is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative thread. The author uses transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas and paragraphs, creating a smooth flow of information. The story builds up gradually, introducing characters and setting, and raising questions that keep the reader engaged. However, the text assumes some background knowledge of the time period and social context, which may make it less accessible to modern readers.
