The text appears to be a biographical account of Will Bradley, an American artist and designer. However, the writing is often disjointed and lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow. The sentences are frequently incomplete, and the grammar is sometimes incorrect. The text also jumps abruptly between different ideas and time periods, disrupting the flow of the narrative. Despite this, the author's enthusiasm and admiration for Bradley's work are evident throughout the text.

In terms of fluency, the text struggles with grammatical errors, incomplete sentences, and awkward phrasing. The writing often feels rushed and unedited, which can make it hard to understand. On the other hand, the text's coherence is also compromised by its disjointed structure and lack of clear transitions between ideas.
