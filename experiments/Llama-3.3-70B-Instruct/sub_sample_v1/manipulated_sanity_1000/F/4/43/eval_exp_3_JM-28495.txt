The text exhibits a mix of fluency and coherence issues. In terms of fluency, some sentences are well-written and grammatically correct, while others are awkwardly phrased or contain errors. The narrative voice is generally clear, but there are moments of confusion due to unclear sentence structure or word choice. Regarding coherence, the text as a whole is well-structured, with a logical progression of events and a clear narrative arc. However, some transitions between sentences or paragraphs feel abrupt, and the inclusion of certain details or dialogue can disrupt the flow of the story.
