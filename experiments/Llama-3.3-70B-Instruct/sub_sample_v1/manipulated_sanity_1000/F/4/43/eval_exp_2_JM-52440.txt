The text appears to be a theological discussion on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper, specifically focusing on the concept of the Real Presence. In terms of fluency, the text is often convoluted and difficult to follow, with long, winding sentences and unclear transitions between ideas. The language is formal and archaic, which may contribute to the text's overall lack of clarity. Regarding coherence, the text attempts to build a logical argument, but the structure is often disjointed and meandering, making it challenging to discern the author's main points.
