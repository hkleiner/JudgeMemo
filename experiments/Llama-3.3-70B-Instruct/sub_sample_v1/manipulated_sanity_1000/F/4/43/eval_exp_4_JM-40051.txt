The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with complex sentence structures and poetic language. However, the fluency is often disrupted by grammatical errors, run-on sentences, and unclear phrasing, making it difficult to follow. The coherence of the text is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the abundance of tangential information. Despite this, the author attempts to build a narrative around the discovery of the "Garden of Eden" and presents various arguments to support their claim.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
