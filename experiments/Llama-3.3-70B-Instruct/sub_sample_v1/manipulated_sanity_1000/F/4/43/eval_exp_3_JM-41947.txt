The text appears to be a biographical passage about the life of Fran√ßois Boucher, a French artist. However, the initial part of the text is disjointed and lacks fluency, with sentences that are grammatically incorrect or hard to follow. The text improves in terms of fluency and coherence as it progresses, with more coherent sentences and a clearer narrative structure. The author's use of descriptive language and historical context adds to the text's coherence, but the overall quality is still hindered by the initial disjointedness and some awkward sentence constructions.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
