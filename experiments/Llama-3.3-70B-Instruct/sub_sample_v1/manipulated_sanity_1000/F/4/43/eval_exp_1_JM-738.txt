The text appears to be a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. However, the text is often difficult to follow due to its dense and convoluted structure, with many tangents and asides. The author's use of language is often archaic and may be unfamiliar to modern readers. In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, making it challenging to discern a clear narrative thread. The fluency of the text is also affected by the numerous errors in punctuation, grammar, and syntax.
