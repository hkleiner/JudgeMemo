The text appears to be a jumbled and incoherent version of Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost". The fluency of the text is severely impaired due to numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent wording. The coherence of the text is also compromised, as the narrative is disjointed and difficult to follow. The story's original flow and meaning are obscured by the errors and distortions, making it challenging to understand the plot and characters.
