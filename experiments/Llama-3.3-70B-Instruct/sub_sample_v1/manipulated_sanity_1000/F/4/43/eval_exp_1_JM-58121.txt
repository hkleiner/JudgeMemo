The text appears to be a historical passage discussing British imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is often marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and unclear sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and verbose, which may contribute to the text's overall lack of clarity. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and ideas, such as the history of British colonization, the characteristics of the Boers, and the economic conditions of South Africa, without a clear narrative thread or logical flow. While the text attempts to present a cohesive argument, its disjointed structure and numerous errors detract from its overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
