The text is a satirical retelling of H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds," with a focus on fashion and women's interests. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and clever wordplay. However, there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear narrative thread. The story jumps between different characters and plot points, making it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
