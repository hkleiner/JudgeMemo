The text is a historical narrative about the life of Fran√ßois Boucher, with a focus on his early years and artistic development. In terms of fluency, the text is often hindered by awkward sentence structures, excessive use of commas, and unclear phrasing, which can make it difficult to follow. The writing style is somewhat archaic and may not be easily accessible to modern readers. Regarding coherence, the text generally follows a chronological structure, but the transitions between paragraphs and ideas can be abrupt, and some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
