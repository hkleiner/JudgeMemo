Regarding fluency, the text is often difficult to follow due to its complex sentence structures, numerous grammatical errors, and inconsistent punctuation.

In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, lacking a clear and logical flow. The author's arguments and points are not well-organized, and the text feels disjointed and confusing.
