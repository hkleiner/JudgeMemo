The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, it is marred by numerous grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing, which disrupt the fluency of the text. The coherence of the text is also affected, as the author jumps between different ideas and biblical references without clear transitions. Despite this, the text attempts to present a clear argument about the location of the Garden of Eden, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
