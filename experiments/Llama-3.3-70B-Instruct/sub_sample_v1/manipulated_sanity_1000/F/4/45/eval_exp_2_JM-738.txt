The text appears to be a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. However, the text is often disjointed and lacks clear transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of quotes and references adds to the text's complexity. In terms of fluency, the sentences are generally well-structured, but the language is often dense and convoluted. The coherence of the text suffers from the lack of clear organization and transitions, making it challenging to understand the author's main arguments.
