The text appears to be a philosophical and theological discussion on the origin of myths and the Bible. In terms of fluency, the text is often difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and unclear wording. The writing style is formal and outdated, which may contribute to the challenges in understanding. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and historical references, making it hard to discern a clear and logical flow of arguments. The author attempts to build a case against the idea that the Bible has a mythical origin, but the presentation is disjointed and lacks clarity.
