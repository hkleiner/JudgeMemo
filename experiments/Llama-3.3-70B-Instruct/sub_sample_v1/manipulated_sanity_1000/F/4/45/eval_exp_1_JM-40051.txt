The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, affecting its fluency. The coherence of the text is also impacted by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the abundance of tangential information. The author's argument about the location of the Garden of Eden is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, making it challenging to follow. Despite this, the text conveys a sense of enthusiasm and conviction, and the author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
