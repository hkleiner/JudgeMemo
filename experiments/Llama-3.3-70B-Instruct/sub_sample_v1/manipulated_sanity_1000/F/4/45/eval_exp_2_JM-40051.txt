The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, affecting its fluency. The coherence of the text is also impacted by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the abundance of tangential information. The author's argument about the location of the Garden of Eden is presented, but it is often obscured by meandering sentences and unclear connections between paragraphs. Despite this, the text does convey a sense of enthusiasm and conviction from the author.
