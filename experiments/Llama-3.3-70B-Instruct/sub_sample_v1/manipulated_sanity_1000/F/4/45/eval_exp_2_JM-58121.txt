The text appears to be a historical passage discussing British imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is often convoluted and difficult to follow, with long, winding sentences and unclear transitions between ideas. The writing style is formal and somewhat archaic, which may contribute to the sense of disjointedness. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and ideas, such as the history of British colonization, the characteristics of the Boers, and the economic conditions of South Africa, without a clear narrative thread to tie them together.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
