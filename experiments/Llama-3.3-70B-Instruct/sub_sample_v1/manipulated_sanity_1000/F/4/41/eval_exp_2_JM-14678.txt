The text appears to be a jumbled and distorted version of H.G. Wells' classic science fiction novel "The War of the Worlds". The fluency of the text is severely impaired due to the numerous typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors that make it difficult to read and understand. The coherence of the text is also affected, as the distorted language and formatting disrupt the flow of the narrative and make it challenging to follow the story. Despite these issues, the overall structure and content of the original story are still vaguely recognizable.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 1
