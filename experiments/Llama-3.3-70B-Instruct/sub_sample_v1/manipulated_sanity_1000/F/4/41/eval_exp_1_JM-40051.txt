The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with a mix of biblical references and geographical descriptions. In terms of fluency, the text is often hindered by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which disrupt the flow of reading. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and verbose, making it challenging to follow. Regarding coherence, the text attempts to build a narrative around the discovery of the Garden of Eden, but the argument is often meandering and lacks clear transitions between ideas. The author jumps between different topics, such as biblical references, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes, which can make the text feel disjointed.
