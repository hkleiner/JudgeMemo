The text appears to be a passage from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost". The story is well-structured and coherent, with a clear narrative flow. However, the fluency is severely impacted by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and formatting issues, which hinder the reading experience. The text's coherence is maintained through the consistent development of the plot and character introductions, despite the technical issues.
