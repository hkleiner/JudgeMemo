This makes it challenging to follow the narrative and understand the author's intended message. The text's coherence is somewhat maintained through its loose structure and thematic focus on Christmas, but the errors and inconsistencies hinder a smooth reading experience. The fluency is significantly affected, as the text's individual sentences are often poorly constructed and difficult to decipher.
