The text is extremely difficult to read due to numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which severely impact its fluency. The coherence of the text is also compromised as the narrative jumps between different ideas and historical references without clear connections, making it hard to follow the author's argument. Despite the challenges, the text appears to be attempting to discuss the concept of myths and their relation to religion, but the poor writing quality hinders the overall understanding.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
