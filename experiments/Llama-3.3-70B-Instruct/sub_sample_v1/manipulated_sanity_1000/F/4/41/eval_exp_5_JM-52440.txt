The text appears to be a theological discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of coherence, the text is well-structured and organized, with a clear introduction, chapter divisions, and a logical flow of ideas. However, the fluency of the text is compromised by numerous typographical errors, inconsistencies in spelling and punctuation, and awkward sentence constructions, which hinder the reader's ability to follow the argument.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
