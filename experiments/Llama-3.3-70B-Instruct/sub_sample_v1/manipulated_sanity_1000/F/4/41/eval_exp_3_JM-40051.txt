The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with a mix of biblical references and geographical descriptions. In terms of fluency, the text is often hindered by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which disrupt the flow of reading. The coherence of the text is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the abundance of tangential information. However, the author attempts to build a narrative around the discovery of the Garden of Eden, and the text does convey a sense of enthusiasm and conviction.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
