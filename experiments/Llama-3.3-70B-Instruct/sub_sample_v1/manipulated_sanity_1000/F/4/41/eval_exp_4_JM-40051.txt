The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which significantly impact its fluency. The coherence of the text is somewhat maintained as it attempts to present a narrative about the discovery of the Garden of Eden, but the argument is often convoluted and difficult to follow due to the writing quality. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions tries to build a cohesive argument, but the text's overall clarity and readability are compromised by its poor fluency.
