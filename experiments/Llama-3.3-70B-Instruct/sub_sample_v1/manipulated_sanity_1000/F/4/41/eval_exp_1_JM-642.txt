The text, an excerpt from Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a well-structured narrative that explores the protagonist's emotional state and his unique form of worship for the dead. The story flows logically, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive whole. However, the text's fluency is somewhat hindered by the presence of numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkwardly phrased sentences, which disrupt the reading experience. Despite this, the author's writing style is characterized by complex, nuanced language and a deep exploration of the human psyche.
