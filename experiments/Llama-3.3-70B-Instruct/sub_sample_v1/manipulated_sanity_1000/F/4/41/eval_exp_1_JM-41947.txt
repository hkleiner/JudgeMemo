The text appears to be a historical fiction story about the life of Fran√ßois Boucher, an 18th-century French painter. However, the text is marred by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentence structures, which hinder its fluency. The coherence of the text is also affected, as the narrative jumps between different time periods and events, making it challenging to follow. Despite this, the text attempts to provide a cohesive narrative, exploring Boucher's early life, his family, and his artistic training.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
