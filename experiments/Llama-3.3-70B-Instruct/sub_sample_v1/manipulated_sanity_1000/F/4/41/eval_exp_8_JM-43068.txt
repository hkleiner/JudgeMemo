The text is a well-structured and informative introduction to the life and work of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The author's writing is formal and descriptive, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The text demonstrates a high level of coherence, with each paragraph building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive overview of Millet's art and its historical context. However, the fluency of the text is occasionally disrupted by complex sentence structures and archaic vocabulary, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow.
