The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", demonstrates strong coherence, with a well-structured narrative that introduces the setting, characters, and plot in a logical and engaging manner. The story flows smoothly, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive whole. However, the fluency is somewhat hindered by minor errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, which may disrupt the reader's experience. The writing style is characteristic of Wilde's wit and humor, with vivid descriptions and clever dialogue.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
