The text appears to be a philosophical and theological discussion on the origin of myths and their relation to the Bible. However, the writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, typos, and awkward sentence structures, which hinder the fluency of the text. Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a clear and coherent argument, with the author presenting a logical and well-structured case against the idea that the Bible has a mythical origin. The use of historical references and quotes adds to the coherence of the text, but the overall quality is compromised by the poor writing quality.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
