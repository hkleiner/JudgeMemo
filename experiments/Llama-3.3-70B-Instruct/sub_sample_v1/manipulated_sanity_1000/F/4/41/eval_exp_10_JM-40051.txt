The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with some grammatical errors, typos, and awkward sentence structures, which affect its fluency. The coherence of the text is relatively good, as it presents a clear argument and builds upon the idea of discovering the Garden of Eden, with the author providing supporting evidence and explanations. However, the text jumps between different ideas and biblical references, which can make it challenging to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
