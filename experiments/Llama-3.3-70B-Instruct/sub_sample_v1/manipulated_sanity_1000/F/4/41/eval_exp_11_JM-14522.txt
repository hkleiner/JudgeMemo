The author's use of language is sophisticated, and the narrative flows smoothly. However, there are a few minor errors in punctuation and spelling, such as "wjo" instead of "who" and "vonnleaving" instead of "leaving". In terms of coherence, the text is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the setting and characters. The story builds up to a suspenseful atmosphere, effectively setting the stage for the rest of the narrative.
