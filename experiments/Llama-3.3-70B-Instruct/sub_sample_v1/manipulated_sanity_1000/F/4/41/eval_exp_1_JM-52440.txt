The text appears to be a theological discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, specifically the concept of the Real Presence. In terms of fluency, the text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, with numerous grammatical errors, typos, and inconsistencies in punctuation. The sentences are often long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is generally well-structured, with a clear introduction, chapter divisions, and a logical flow of ideas. However, the argumentation is dense and may require close attention from the reader to fully understand the author's points.
