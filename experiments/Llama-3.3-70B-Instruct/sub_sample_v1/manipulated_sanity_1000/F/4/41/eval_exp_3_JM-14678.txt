The text appears to be a parody of H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" with a humorous and satirical tone. However, the fluency of the text is severely impacted by numerous typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistent spelling, making it difficult to read and understand. The coherence of the text is also affected, as the narrative jumps between different ideas and scenes, but the overall structure and organization of the story are still somewhat discernible. The use of witty language and clever wordplay adds to the text's coherence, but the errors and inconsistencies detract from its overall quality.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 1
