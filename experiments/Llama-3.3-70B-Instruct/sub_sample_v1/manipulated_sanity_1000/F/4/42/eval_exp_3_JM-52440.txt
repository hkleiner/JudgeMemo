The text is a formal and structured discussion on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of coherence, the text is well-organized and logically structured, with each chapter and section building on the previous one to form a clear argument. The author presents different perspectives and definitions, making it easy to follow the discussion. However, the text's fluency is somewhat hindered by grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent verb tenses, which can make it difficult to read in some places.
