The text appears to be a 19th-century writing style, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, affecting its fluency. The coherence of the text is also impacted by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and the abundance of tangential information. Despite this, the author attempts to build a narrative around the discovery of the Garden of Eden, using biblical references and geographical descriptions to support their claim. The text's organization and flow are somewhat disjointed, making it challenging to follow the author's argument.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
