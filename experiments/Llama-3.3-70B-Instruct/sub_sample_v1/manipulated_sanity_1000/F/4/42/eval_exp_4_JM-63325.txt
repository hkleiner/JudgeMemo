The text appears to be a historical document, specifically a preface and chapter from a book titled "Infant Schools and Dissenters: A Vindication of 'A Letter of Affectionate Remonstrance'". The text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which may make it challenging to read. In terms of fluency, the text is often grammatically incorrect, with numerous errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. The coherence of the text is relatively good, as the author presents a clear argument and provides evidence to support their claims, with a logical flow of ideas between sentences and paragraphs.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
