The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," demonstrates excellent fluency, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. The narrative flows smoothly, and the author's use of language is engaging and descriptive. However, there are some minor issues with coherence, as the story occasionally jumps between different scenes and characters without clear transitions. Additionally, some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. Overall, the text is well-written and easy to understand, but could benefit from some improvements in terms of coherence and sentence structure.
