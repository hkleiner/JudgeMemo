The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is often verbose and contains long, convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow. The author's writing style is also somewhat archaic, which may detract from the overall readability of the text. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions can be confusing at times, and the text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical flow of ideas.
