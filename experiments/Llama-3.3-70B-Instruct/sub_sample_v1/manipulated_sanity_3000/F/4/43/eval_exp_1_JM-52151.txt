The text is a theological discussion on the nature and extent of inspiration in Scripture, with a clear and well-structured argument. However, the writing style is formal and dense, with long sentences and complex vocabulary, which may hinder fluency. The coherence of the text is strong, with each chapter and section building on the previous one to form a cohesive whole. The author's use of biblical references and quotes adds to the text's coherence, but may also contribute to its density and lack of fluency.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
