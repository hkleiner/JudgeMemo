The text, an excerpt from Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", showcases a complex and introspective narrative. In terms of fluency, the writing is often dense and convoluted, with long, winding sentences that can be challenging to follow. However, this complexity also contributes to the text's unique, lyrical quality. Regarding coherence, the narrative is well-structured and organized, with each chapter building on the previous one to form a cohesive whole. The author's use of stream-of-consciousness narration and introspection adds depth and nuance to the story, but may also require close attention from the reader to fully appreciate.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
