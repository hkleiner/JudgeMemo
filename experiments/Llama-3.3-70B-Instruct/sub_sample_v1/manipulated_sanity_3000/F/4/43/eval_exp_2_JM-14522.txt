The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," showcases a high level of fluency, with well-crafted sentences that are grammatically correct and engaging. The narrative flows smoothly, making it easy to follow the story. However, there are some minor issues with coherence, as the text jumps between different scenes and characters, which can be slightly disorienting. The story is well-structured overall, but some transitions between paragraphs could be improved for better coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
