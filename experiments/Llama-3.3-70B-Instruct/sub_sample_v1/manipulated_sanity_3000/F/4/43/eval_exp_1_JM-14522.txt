The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," showcases a high level of fluency, with well-crafted sentences that are grammatically correct and engaging. The narrative flows smoothly, making it easy to follow. However, there are some minor issues with coherence, as the story occasionally jumps between different ideas and scenes, which can make it slightly challenging to understand the connections between them. The text's structure and organization are generally good, but some transitions could be improved for better coherence.
