The text appears to be a historical account of the annexation of the Transvaal in South Africa, with a critical perspective on British imperialism. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different topics and ideas, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's arguments and points are not always clearly connected, and the text could benefit from a more logical and organized structure.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
