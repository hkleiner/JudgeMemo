The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, and excessive use of commas, which can make it difficult to follow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident, but the text could benefit from clearer organization and transitions to improve its overall coherence.
