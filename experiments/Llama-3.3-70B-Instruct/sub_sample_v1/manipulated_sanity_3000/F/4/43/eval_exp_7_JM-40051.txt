The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to identify the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is often convoluted and difficult to follow, with long, winding sentences and frequent tangents. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and may be challenging for modern readers to understand. Regarding coherence, the text has a clear overall structure, but the author's train of thought can be hard to follow, and the connections between ideas are not always clear. The text jumps between different topics, such as geography, biblical references, and personal anecdotes, which can make it difficult to maintain a coherent narrative thread.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
