The text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with few grammatical errors, but some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured and organized, with a clear introduction, analysis, and argument, but the dense and detailed analysis of the novel's plot and characters can be overwhelming at times.
