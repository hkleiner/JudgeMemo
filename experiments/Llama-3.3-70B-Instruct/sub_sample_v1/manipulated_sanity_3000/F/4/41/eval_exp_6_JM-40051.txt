The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is often marred by grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and excessive use of commas, which can make it difficult to follow. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and verbose, which may detract from the overall readability of the text. 

Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear and logical structure. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions can be confusing, and the text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more organized presentation of ideas.
