The text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, but there are some errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, which may hinder the reading experience. The coherence of the text is good, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas, making it easy to follow the author's argument. However, the text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may make it challenging for some readers to understand.
