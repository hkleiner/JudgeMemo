The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it often suffers from long, winding sentences and awkward phrasing. The author's writing style is often verbose and meandering, which can make it difficult to follow. 

Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author presents a clear argument and provides evidence to support their claim, but the text often digresses into descriptive passages about the scenery and geography of the area, which can disrupt the flow of the argument. The author also assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Bible and geography, which can make the text difficult to follow for some readers.
