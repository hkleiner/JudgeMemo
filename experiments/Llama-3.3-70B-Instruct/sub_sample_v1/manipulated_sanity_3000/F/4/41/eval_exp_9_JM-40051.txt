The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it suffers from some grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing. The coherence of the text is also affected by the author's tendency to meander and include excessive details, making it difficult to follow the main argument. However, the text does have a clear structure and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.
