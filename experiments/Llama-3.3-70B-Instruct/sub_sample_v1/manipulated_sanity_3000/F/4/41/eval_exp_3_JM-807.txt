The text provided is a passage from the story "Hunted Down" by Charles Dickens. The story is well-structured and coherent, with each sentence building on the previous one to form a cohesive narrative. The author's use of language is formal and descriptive, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow. However, the text's coherence is excellent, with a clear flow of ideas and a well-developed plot. On the other hand, the fluency of the text is somewhat hindered by the numerous typos, grammatical errors, and awkwardly phrased sentences, which may disrupt the reader's flow.
