The text, an excerpt from Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a well-structured narrative that explores the inner world of the protagonist, George Stransom. The story flows logically, with each sentence and paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and immersive experience. However, the text's fluency is somewhat hindered by its complex and dense language, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow. The writing is characterized by long, winding sentences and a formal, somewhat archaic tone, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
