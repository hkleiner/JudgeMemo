The text is a well-structured and organized discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author presents a clear and logical argument, using relevant biblical references and historical context to support their claims. The text is coherent, with each paragraph building on the previous one to form a cohesive narrative. However, the language is formal and complex, with some sentences being quite long and convoluted, which may affect fluency. The author's use of transitional phrases and clear headings helps to maintain coherence, but the text could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve fluency.
