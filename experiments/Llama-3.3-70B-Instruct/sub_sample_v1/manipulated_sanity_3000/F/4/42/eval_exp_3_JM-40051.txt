In terms of fluency, the text is often hindered by grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent verb tenses, which can make it difficult to follow. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and verbose, which may detract from the overall readability. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear and logical flow of thought. However, the author does attempt to provide a detailed and vivid description of the proposed Garden of Eden location, which suggests some level of organization and planning.
