The text is a biographical account of Fran√ßois Boucher's life, written in a descriptive and engaging style. The author's use of language is rich and vivid, with intricate sentence structures that contribute to the text's fluency. However, the narrative jumps between different periods of Boucher's life, which can make it challenging to follow at times, affecting the text's coherence. The author assumes a level of background knowledge about art history and 18th-century France, which may also impact the text's overall coherence for some readers.
