The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing is often verbose and meandering, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of rhetorical questions, biblical references, and descriptive passages creates a sense of grandeur, but also disrupts the flow of the text. 

Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's attempt to connect the discovery of the Garden of Eden to the biblical account and the geography of the American continent is intriguing, but the execution is often confusing and disjointed. The text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical organization of ideas.
