The text is a well-structured and organized theological discussion on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The author presents a clear and logical argument, supported by references to Church documents and Articles, to refute the doctrine of transubstantiation. The text is written in a formal and academic tone, with complex sentences and technical vocabulary, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow. However, the author's use of transitional phrases and clear headings helps to maintain coherence and flow.

The text's fluency is good, with well-crafted sentences that effectively convey the author's ideas. The use of rhetorical questions and emphatic statements adds to the text's persuasive power. However, the dense and complex nature of the subject matter may make it difficult for some readers to fully appreciate the author's arguments.
