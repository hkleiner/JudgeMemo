The text is a historical narrative that describes the author's experiences as part of a movement to establish free public schools in the Philippine Islands. The writing is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the text is quite dense and meandering, with long paragraphs and frequent digressions, which can make it difficult to follow at times. The coherence of the text is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between sections and the inclusion of seemingly unrelated anecdotes. Despite this, the author's descriptive language and attention to detail help to create vivid images of the people and places described.
