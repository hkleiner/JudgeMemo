The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to identify the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing is often verbose and meandering, which can make it difficult to follow. The author's use of rhetorical flourishes and biblical references adds to the text's complexity. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's attempts to connect the description of the landscape to the biblical account of the Garden of Eden can be confusing at times.
