The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", exhibits a high level of fluency, with well-crafted sentences that are grammatically correct and engaging. The author's use of language is sophisticated, and the narrative flows smoothly. However, the coherence of the text is somewhat disrupted by the inclusion of unrelated passages, such as the discussion on the imaginary line between Honolulu and Manila, which seems out of place in the story. Additionally, some sections appear to be tangential to the main plot, affecting the overall coherence of the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
