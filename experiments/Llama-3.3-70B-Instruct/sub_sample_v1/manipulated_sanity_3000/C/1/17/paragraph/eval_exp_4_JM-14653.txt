In terms of fluency, the writing is often lyrical and engaging, with complex sentences that showcase the author's mastery of language. However, some sentences can be dense and meandering, which may hinder the reader's understanding. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and narratives, which can make it challenging to follow. Despite this, the author's central argument about the decline of the Christmas spirit and the importance of faith and goodwill is clear and well-developed.
