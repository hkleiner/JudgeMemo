The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences can be long and convoluted, making it challenging to follow. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, analysis, and argument, but the transitions between sections can be abrupt, and the inclusion of unrelated historical information disrupts the flow.
