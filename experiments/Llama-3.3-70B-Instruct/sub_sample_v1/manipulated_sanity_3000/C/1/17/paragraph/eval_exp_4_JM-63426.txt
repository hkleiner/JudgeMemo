The text is a biographical account of Will Bradley's life, written in a narrative style. Regarding fluency, the text is generally well-written, with clear and grammatically correct sentences. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and chapters, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. The language is often descriptive and engaging, but some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow. 

In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different periods of Bradley's life, and sometimes includes unrelated events or descriptions, which can make it difficult to follow the overall narrative thread. The text also includes some tangential passages and quotes that seem unrelated to the main story, which can disrupt the coherence of the narrative. Despite this, the text provides a clear and detailed picture of Bradley's life and career, and the author's enthusiasm and admiration for the subject are evident throughout.
