The text appears to be a collection of unrelated passages, resulting in a lack of coherence. The writing is often descriptive and poetic, but the abrupt changes in topic and tone disrupt the flow of the narrative. The text jumps between discussing the Garden of Eden, descriptive scenery, and unrelated characters, making it challenging to follow. In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, but the overall structure and organization of the text hinder its readability.
