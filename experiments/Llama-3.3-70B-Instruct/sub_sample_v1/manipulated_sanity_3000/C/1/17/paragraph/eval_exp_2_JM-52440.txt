The text is a formal and informative piece of writing, discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences that are generally grammatically correct. However, the text's coherence is compromised by the inclusion of unrelated passages, such as the descriptions of natural scenery and a native woman attending to a soldier, which disrupt the flow of the argument and make it difficult to follow. The text's organization and structure are also somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
