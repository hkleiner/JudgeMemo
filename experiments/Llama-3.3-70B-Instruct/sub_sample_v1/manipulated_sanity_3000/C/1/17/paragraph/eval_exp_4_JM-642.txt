In terms of fluency, the individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, but their complexity and length can disrupt the flow of the narrative. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different scenes, characters, and ideas, which can make it difficult to understand the overall structure and plot. However, upon closer reading, the text reveals a thoughtful and intentional narrative that explores themes of grief, memory, and the human experience.
