The text is a descriptive and meandering account of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, with vivid descriptions of the scenery, people, and experiences along the way. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language that effectively convey the author's impressions and emotions. However, the text's coherence is somewhat compromised by its lack of a clear narrative structure and tendency to jump between different topics and scenes without clear transitions. The inclusion of unrelated passages and tangents, such as the discussion of theological doctrine, disrupts the flow of the narrative and makes it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
