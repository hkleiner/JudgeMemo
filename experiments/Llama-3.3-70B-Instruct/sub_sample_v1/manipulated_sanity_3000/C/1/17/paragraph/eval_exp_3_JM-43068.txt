The text is a well-structured and informative piece about the life and art of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, a prominent painter of peasant life. The writing is formal and sophisticated, with complex sentences that demonstrate a high level of fluency. The text coheres well, with each paragraph building on the previous one to form a comprehensive narrative about Millet's life, art, and influences. However, there are some abrupt transitions and unrelated passages, such as the section about the garden of Eden, which disrupt the overall flow of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
