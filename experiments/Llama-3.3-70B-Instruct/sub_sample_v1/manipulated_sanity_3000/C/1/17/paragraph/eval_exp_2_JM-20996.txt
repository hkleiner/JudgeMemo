The text is a historical narrative that recounts the author's experiences as part of a movement to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands. The writing is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the text jumps abruptly between different scenes and ideas, disrupting the coherence of the narrative. The inclusion of unrelated passages, such as the description of a drama, further disrupts the flow of the story. Despite this, the author's use of vivid descriptions and historical context provides interesting insights into the time period.
