The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to identify the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and varied vocabulary. However, there are some awkward phrasings and transitions that disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the complexity, but also creates a sense of disjointedness.
