The text is a descriptive and meandering account of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, filled with vivid descriptions of the landscape, people, and experiences along the way. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language that effectively convey the author's observations and impressions. However, the text's coherence is somewhat compromised by its lack of a clear narrative structure and tendency to jump between different topics and scenes without clear transitions. The author's use of descriptive language and anecdotes creates a sense of atmosphere and immersion, but can also make the text feel disjointed and difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
