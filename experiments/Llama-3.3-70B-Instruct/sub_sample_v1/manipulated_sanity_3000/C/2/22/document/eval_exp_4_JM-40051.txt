The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it often suffers from wordiness, meandering sentences, and excessive use of descriptive phrases. The author's writing style is often verbose and repetitive, which can make it difficult to follow. 

Regarding coherence, the text has a clear overall structure, starting with an introduction to the author's discovery and then describing the location and features of the Garden of Eden. However, the text often jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it hard to follow the author's train of thought. The author also uses many proper nouns and references to biblical and geographical locations, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with them.
