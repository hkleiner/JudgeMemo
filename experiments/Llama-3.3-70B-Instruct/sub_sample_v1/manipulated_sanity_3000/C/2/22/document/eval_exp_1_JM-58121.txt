In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and proper grammar. However, the writing style is somewhat archaic and dense, which may make it challenging to follow for modern readers. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The author presents a clear argument about the consequences of British imperialism in South Africa and provides various examples and anecdotes to support their claims.
