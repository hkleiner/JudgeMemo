The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing style is often verbose and meandering, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of metaphors, allusions, and descriptive language adds to the text's fluency, but also contributes to its density and complexity. 

Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author presents a clear argument and provides evidence to support their claim, but the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it hard to maintain a clear thread of thought. The use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect the different sections, but the text could benefit from a clearer and more logical organization.
