The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last plot, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences are often long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and organization, but the numerous references to characters and plot points can be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the original story.
