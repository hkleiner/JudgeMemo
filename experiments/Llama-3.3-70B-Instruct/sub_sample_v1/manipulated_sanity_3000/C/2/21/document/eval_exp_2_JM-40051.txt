The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, the writing style is often verbose and meandering, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the text's complexity. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's arguments and claims are not always clearly supported, and the text relies heavily on assertions and assumptions.
