The text is a descriptive and narrative piece that follows the journey of two pilgrims on a tricycle to Canterbury. The writing is rich in detail, with vivid descriptions of the scenery, people, and events encountered along the way. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language that create a immersive atmosphere. The author's use of figurative language, such as metaphors and similes, adds to the text's fluency. Regarding coherence, the text is generally well-structured, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a sense of progression and continuity. However, some paragraphs feel a bit disconnected from the rest, and the text could benefit from clearer transitions between sections.
