In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentence structure can be dense and convoluted at times. Regarding coherence, the text is generally well-organized, with a clear chronological structure, but some sections feel disjointed and lack clear connections to the main argument. The author's use of anecdotes and quotes adds depth and context, but can also disrupt the flow of the narrative.
