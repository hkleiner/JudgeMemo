The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American continent. The writing is often verbose and meandering, with long sentences and tangential descriptions. While the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident, the text's fluency is hindered by its convoluted structure and overly elaborate language. In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. However, the author does attempt to provide a clear structure and organization, with each section building on the previous one to support their argument.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
