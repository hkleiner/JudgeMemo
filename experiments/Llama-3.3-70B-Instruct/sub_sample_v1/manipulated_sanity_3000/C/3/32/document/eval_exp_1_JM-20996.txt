The text is a historical narrative that appears to be well-structured and coherent, with each chapter building on the previous one to form a cohesive story. However, the fluency of the text is somewhat hindered by the presence of numerous placeholders ("a thing", "a stuff") that disrupt the flow of the narrative. The author's writing style is generally clear and descriptive, but the use of these placeholders creates confusion and makes it difficult to follow the story at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
