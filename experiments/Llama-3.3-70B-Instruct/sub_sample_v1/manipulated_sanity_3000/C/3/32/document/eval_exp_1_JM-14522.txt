The text, an excerpt from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost", demonstrates excellent fluency, with well-crafted sentences that are grammatically correct and engaging. The narrative flows smoothly, making it easy to follow the story. However, upon closer inspection, some sentences appear to be intentionally altered or contain placeholders ("a stuff", "a thing"), which disrupts the overall fluency. Regarding coherence, the text is well-structured, with each chapter building on the previous one to form a cohesive narrative. The story is organized, and the author's use of descriptive language helps to create a vivid atmosphere.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
