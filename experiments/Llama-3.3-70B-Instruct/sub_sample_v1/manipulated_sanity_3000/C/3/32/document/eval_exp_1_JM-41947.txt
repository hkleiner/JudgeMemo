The text is a biographical account of Fran√ßois Boucher's life, written in a descriptive and elaborate style. Regarding fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language, but it often suffers from unclear references and vague descriptions, which can make it difficult to follow. The use of phrases like "a thing" and "the stuff" repeatedly can be confusing and disrupts the flow of the text. In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different periods of Boucher's life and includes various historical and cultural references, which can make it hard to maintain a clear narrative thread. However, the text does provide a comprehensive overview of Boucher's life and artistic development.
