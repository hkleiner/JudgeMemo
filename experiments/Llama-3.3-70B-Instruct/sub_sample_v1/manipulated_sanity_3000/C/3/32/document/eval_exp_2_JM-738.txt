The text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens' last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences are often long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and organization, but the author's use of obscure references and allusions may make it challenging for some readers to understand the context and connections between ideas.
