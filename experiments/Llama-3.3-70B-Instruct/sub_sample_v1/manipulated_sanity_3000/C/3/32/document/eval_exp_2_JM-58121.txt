The text is a historical narrative about imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Transvaal. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written with complex sentences and proper grammar, but it is dense and sometimes difficult to follow due to the use of outdated language and numerous references to historical events and figures. The coherence of the text is also affected by the lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and the abundance of tangential information. However, the text does present a clear argument about the negative consequences of British imperialism in South Africa.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
