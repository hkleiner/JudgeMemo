The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to identify the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is often convoluted and difficult to follow, with long, winding sentences and excessive use of commas. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and may be challenging for modern readers to understand. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it hard to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. However, the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout the text, and the use of vivid descriptions and biblical references adds to the text's coherence.
