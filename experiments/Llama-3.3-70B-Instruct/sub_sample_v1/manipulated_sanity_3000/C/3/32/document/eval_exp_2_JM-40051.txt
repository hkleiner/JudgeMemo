The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is often verbose and contains long, convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow. The writing style is also somewhat archaic, which may detract from its overall readability. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. However, the author does attempt to build a cohesive argument, using biblical references and geographical descriptions to support their claim.
