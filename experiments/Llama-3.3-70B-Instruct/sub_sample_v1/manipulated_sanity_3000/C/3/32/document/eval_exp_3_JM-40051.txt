The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, there are some awkward phrasings and repetitive structures that disrupt the flow. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it difficult to follow at times. The author's use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the complexity, but the overall structure and organization could be improved for better clarity.
