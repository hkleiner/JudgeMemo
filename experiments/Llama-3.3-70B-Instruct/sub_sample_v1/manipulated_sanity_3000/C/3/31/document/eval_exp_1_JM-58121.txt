The text discusses imperialism in South Africa, specifically the annexation of the Cape of Good Hope and the treatment of the native population and the Boers. The text is well-structured and coherent, with a clear narrative thread that explores the historical context and the consequences of British rule. However, the text is marred by numerous instances of "it" being used as a placeholder, which disrupts the fluency of the text and makes it difficult to follow at times. The writing style is formal and informative, but the excessive use of "it" detracts from the overall quality of the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
