The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to identify a location as the biblical Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and poetic language. However, it is often verbose and meandering, with long, winding sentences that can be difficult to follow. The author's writing style is often overly elaborate and ornate, which can make the text feel dense and hard to read. 

Regarding coherence, the text is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The author jumps between different ideas and descriptions, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. The text also relies heavily on assumptions and assertions, without providing clear evidence or logical connections between ideas. Despite this, the author's enthusiasm and descriptive language help to create a vivid picture of the location they are describing.
