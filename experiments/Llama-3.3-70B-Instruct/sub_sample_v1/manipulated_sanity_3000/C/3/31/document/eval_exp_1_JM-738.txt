The text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with complex sentences and vocabulary. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with few grammatical errors, but the sentences are often long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and organization, but the author's use of pronouns and references to characters can be confusing at times, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
