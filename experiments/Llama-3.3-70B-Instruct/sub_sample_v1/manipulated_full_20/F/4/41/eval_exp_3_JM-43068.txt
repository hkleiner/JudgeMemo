The text is a well-structured biography of Jean Fran√ßois Millet, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The author's writing is formal and descriptive, with complex sentences that effectively convey the artist's life, style, and influences. The text's coherence is strong, with each chapter building on the previous one to create a comprehensive narrative. However, the fluency is occasionally disrupted by long, convoluted sentences and some archaic language.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
