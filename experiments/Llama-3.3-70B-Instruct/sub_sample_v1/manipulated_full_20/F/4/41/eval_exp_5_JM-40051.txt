The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's claim that they have found the location of the Garden of Eden. The writing is often verbose and meandering, with long sentences and tangential discussions. While the author provides some vivid descriptions of the natural scenery, the text as a whole lacks clarity and organization, making it difficult to follow. The author's use of language is generally formal, but the tone can be somewhat informal and conversational at times.
