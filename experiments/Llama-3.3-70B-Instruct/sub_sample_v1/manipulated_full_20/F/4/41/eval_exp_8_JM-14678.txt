In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written, with complex sentences and vocabulary that create a sense of irony and wit. However, the narrative can be disjointed at times, with abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas. Regarding coherence, the story has a clear overall structure, but the plot is often meandering and difficult to follow, with characters and events introduced without clear purpose or resolution.
