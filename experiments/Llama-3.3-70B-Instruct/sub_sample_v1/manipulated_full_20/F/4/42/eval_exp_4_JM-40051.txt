The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece about the location of the Garden of Eden, with the author presenting their case for it being in the American Midwest.

The text lacks coherence due to its disjointed structure and numerous digressions, making it difficult to follow the author's main argument. The fluency is also affected by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and an overly formal tone.
