The text is a complex and detailed analysis of Charles Dickens' unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The writing is formal and academic, with a high level of vocabulary and sentence complexity. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with clear and concise sentences that effectively convey the author's arguments. However, the text's coherence is somewhat compromised by its dense and meandering structure, with multiple tangents and digressions that can make it difficult to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
