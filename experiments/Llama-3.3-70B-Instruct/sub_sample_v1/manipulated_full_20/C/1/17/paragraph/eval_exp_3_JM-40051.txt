The text is a lengthy and descriptive passage that attempts to convince the reader of the author's claim that they have discovered the location of the Garden of Eden. In terms of fluency, the text is often verbose and contains long, winding sentences that can be difficult to follow. The writing style is also somewhat archaic and may not be engaging for modern readers. Regarding coherence, the text jumps between different ideas and topics, making it challenging to discern a clear structure or narrative thread. The author's arguments and claims are not always well-supported or clearly explained, which can lead to confusion.
