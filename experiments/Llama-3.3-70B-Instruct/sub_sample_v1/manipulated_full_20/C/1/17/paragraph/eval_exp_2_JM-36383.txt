The text is a narrative of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, written in a descriptive and conversational style. The author's use of language is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and vivid descriptions of the scenery and characters. However, the text's coherence is sometimes disrupted by tangential comments, abrupt changes in topic, and lengthy digressions, which can make it difficult to follow the main narrative thread. The author's attempts to emulate the style of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales can also lead to some awkward phrasing and word choices.
