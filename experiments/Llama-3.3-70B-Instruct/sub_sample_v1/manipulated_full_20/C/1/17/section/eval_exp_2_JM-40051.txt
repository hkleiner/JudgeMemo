The text is a lengthy and meandering narrative that attempts to prove the location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. The writing is often convoluted, with long sentences and tangential asides that disrupt the flow of the argument. The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, making it difficult to follow. The language is often overly formal and ornate, which can make it hard to understand. Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate a clear passion and conviction on the part of the author.
