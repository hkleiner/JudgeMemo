The text is a historical and philosophical narrative that explores the life of Jeanne Poisson, also known as Madame de Pompadour, and her influence on the art world, particularly on the artist Boucher. The text also includes a lengthy response to a pamphlet written by Mr. Geary, discussing the establishment of Infant Schools and the role of Dissenters in education. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences and intricate arguments. 

Regarding fluency, the text is generally well-written, with proper grammar and syntax. However, the complexity of the sentences and the use of archaic language may make it challenging for some readers to follow. 

In terms of coherence, the text jumps between different topics and time periods, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative. The author's use of transitions and connections between ideas is not always clear, making it difficult to understand the relationships between different sections of the text.
