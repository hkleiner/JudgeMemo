The text is a collection of chapters from Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost" and other unrelated stories. The writing is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. However, the coherence is disrupted by the inclusion of unrelated chapters, making it difficult to follow a single narrative thread. The text jumps abruptly from one story to another, affecting its overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
