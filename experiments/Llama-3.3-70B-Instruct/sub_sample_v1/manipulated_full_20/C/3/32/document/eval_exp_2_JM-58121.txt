The text is a historical account of imperialism in South Africa, specifically focusing on the annexation of the Transvaal and the treatment of the native population. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and vocabulary, but it can be dense and difficult to follow at times. The coherence of the text is also good, with a clear structure and organization, but it jumps between different topics and time periods, which can make it hard to understand the overall narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
