The text is a formal and argumentative piece, written in a style typical of 19th-century theological debates. In terms of fluency, the text is well-written, with complex sentences and vocabulary that demonstrate a high level of linguistic proficiency. However, the text's coherence is somewhat compromised by its meandering structure, repetitive arguments, and excessive use of quotes and references, which can make it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
