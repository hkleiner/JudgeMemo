The text is a descriptive and argumentative piece that attempts to convince the reader of the author's claim that they have found the location of the Garden of Eden. The writing is often verbose and meandering, with long sentences and tangential discussions. While the author provides a wealth of descriptive details about the landscape and geography of the proposed Garden of Eden, the text lacks a clear and logical structure, making it difficult to follow at times. The writing is generally fluent, but the complexity of the sentences and the abundance of descriptive language can make it challenging to read.
