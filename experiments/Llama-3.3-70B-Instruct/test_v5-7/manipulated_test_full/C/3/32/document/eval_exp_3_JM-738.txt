1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] The text includes some archaic vocabulary and phrases that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] The narrative jumps between different time periods and plot threads, which can be disorienting.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story is unfinished, and the analysis of the mystery is based on incomplete information.
- [STRUCTURE] The text combines elements of literary criticism, detective fiction, and historical context, which can make it hard to discern a clear narrative thread.
- [CLARITY] Some sections of the text are dense with speculation and theory, making it challenging to distinguish between fact and conjecture.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
The text is generally coherent, but its complexity, combined with the inherent difficulties of analyzing an unfinished story, leads to some confusion. The author's attempts to solve the mystery of Edwin Drood often result in multiple, conflicting theories, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
Despite some issues with sentence structure and archaic language, the text is generally well-written and engaging. The author's passion for the subject matter and their thorough analysis of the story make the text enjoyable to read, even if some sections require close attention to follow.
