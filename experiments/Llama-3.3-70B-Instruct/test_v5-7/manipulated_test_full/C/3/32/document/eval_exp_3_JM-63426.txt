1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
- [SPELLING] There are no noticeable spelling errors, but some words are archaic or less common, which may affect readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] The text often employs complex sentence structures and uses colloquial expressions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which can be challenging for modern readers.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is rich and varied, but includes terms specific to the printing and design industries that may be unfamiliar to non-experts.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different periods of the author's life and various projects, which can make it hard to maintain a clear timeline or understand the relevance of certain anecdotes.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, linear structure, with events and themes presented in a somewhat disjointed manner.
- [CLARITY] Some sections are unclear due to the author's assumption of prior knowledge about historical events, figures, or specific design and printing techniques.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between different topics or time periods are sometimes abrupt, disrupting the flow of the narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
The text's coherence is compromised by its non-linear structure, abrupt transitions, and the assumption of specialized knowledge. However, the narrative remains engaging due to the author's personal anecdotes and insights into the evolution of design and printing.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
Despite some challenges with sentence complexity, archaic vocabulary, and industry-specific terms, the text is generally well-written and fluent. The author's use of language is expressive and engaging, making the reading experience enjoyable for those familiar with the subject matter or willing to navigate its complexities.
