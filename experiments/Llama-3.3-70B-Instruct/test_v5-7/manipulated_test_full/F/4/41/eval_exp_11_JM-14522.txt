1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] several typos and spelling mistakes (e.g., "biught" instead of "bought", "wyen" instead of "when", "x" instead of various words)
- [GRAMMAR] some grammatical errors and inconsistencies (e.g., missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses)
- [SYNTAX] a few instances of awkward sentence structure
- [LEXICON] some words and phrases seem out of place or overly formal

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the story is mostly logical, but some events and character actions seem implausible or unexplained
- [STRUCTURE] the narrative jumps abruptly between scenes and ideas at times
- [CLARITY] a few sections are unclear or difficult to follow due to vague descriptions or unclear motivations
- [TRANSITION] transitions between chapters and scenes could be smoother

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
The story is engaging and well-structured overall, but some events and character actions seem implausible or unexplained, and transitions between scenes could be improved.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
The text is generally readable, but the numerous spelling and grammatical errors, along with some awkward sentence structures and word choices, detract from the overall fluency and make it harder to follow in some places.
