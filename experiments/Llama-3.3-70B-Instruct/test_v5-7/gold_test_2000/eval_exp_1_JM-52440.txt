1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] The text uses complex and archaic vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is sometimes awkward, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrines, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas and topics, such as the introduction, the doctrine of the Real Presence, and the examination of Church documents, which can make it hard to see the overall organization.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are dense and lack clear topic sentences, making it challenging to discern the main point.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother, as the text sometimes feels like a collection of loosely connected ideas.
