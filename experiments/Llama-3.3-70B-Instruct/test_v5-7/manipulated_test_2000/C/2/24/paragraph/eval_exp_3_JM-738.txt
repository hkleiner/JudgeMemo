1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
- [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [SYNTAX] There are instances of complex sentence structures that can disrupt the flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly between different scenes and characters, which can be disorienting.
- [STRUCTURE] The text combines analysis, critique, and summary of Dickens's work, which can make it difficult to discern the author's main argument.
- [CLARITY] Some sections, particularly those discussing the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," are dense and require close attention to understand the relationships between characters.
