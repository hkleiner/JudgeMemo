1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Minor issues with sentence structure and verb tense consistency
- [LEXICON] Some words and phrases may be less familiar to modern readers, but they are used correctly in context
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are long and convoluted, but they do not hinder understanding

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of anachronistic elements like a hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera seems out of place in the story's historical setting
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different scenes and ideas, but the transitions are generally smooth
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the story, such as the character descriptions and dialogue, are clear and engaging, while others, like the ghost's appearances, are somewhat confusing

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
