- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.

- [SYNTAX] There are instances of complex sentence structures that could be simplified for better clarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between some scenes or ideas could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different topics, such as the family's conversation and the ghost's appearance, which might feel disjointed to some readers.
- [CLARITY] A few parts of the story, like the significance of certain details or the full backstory of the ghost, are not immediately clear and require some inference from the reader.
