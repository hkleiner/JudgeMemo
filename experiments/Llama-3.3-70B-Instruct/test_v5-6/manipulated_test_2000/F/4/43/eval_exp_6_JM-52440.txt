-> 1) Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] - Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [CLARITY] - The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrines, which may confuse readers without this background.
* [TRANSITION] - The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and concepts without smooth transitions.
* [LEXICON] - Some words and phrases, such as "sacramental appointment" and "invisibly bestows the invisible gift", may be unclear to readers without a strong theological background.
* [STRUCTURE] - The text could benefit from clearer headings and subheadings to organize the ideas and make them easier to follow.
