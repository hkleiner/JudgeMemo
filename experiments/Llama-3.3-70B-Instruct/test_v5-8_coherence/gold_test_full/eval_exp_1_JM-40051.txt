1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and topics seemingly disconnected and presented in a non-sequential manner.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt, lacking smooth connections to guide the reader through the text.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous long, convoluted sentences that obscure the intended meaning, making it difficult for the reader to follow the author's argument.
- [LOGIC] The author's reasoning and conclusions are sometimes based on unexplained assumptions or leaps in logic, which can confuse the reader and undermine the text's coherence.
- [RELEVANCE] The inclusion of various tangential topics and details (e.g., geological information, personal anecdotes, and biblical references) disrupts the flow of the main argument and may not be relevant to the central claim about the Garden of Eden.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
