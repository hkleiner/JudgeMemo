1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly between different scenes and plot developments without smooth transitions.
* [LOGIC] Some events, such as the ghost's interactions with the family and the resolution of Virginia's disappearance, feel somewhat disconnected from the rest of the story.
* [CLARITY] The text assumes some background knowledge of British aristocracy and American culture, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with these contexts.
* [TRANSITION] The story shifts between humorous and serious tones, which can be jarring at times.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
