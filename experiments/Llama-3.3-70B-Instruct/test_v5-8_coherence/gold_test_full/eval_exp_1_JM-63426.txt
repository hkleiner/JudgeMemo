1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a collection of autobiographical chapters and lacks a clear overarching narrative structure.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections can be abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences and paragraphs are wordy and convoluted, which can impede understanding.
* [LOGIC] The text jumps back and forth in time, and the author's use of flashbacks and anecdotes can disrupt the logical flow of the narrative.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
