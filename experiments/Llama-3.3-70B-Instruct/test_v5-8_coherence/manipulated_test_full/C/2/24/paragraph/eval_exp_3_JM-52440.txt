1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to adoration and sacrifice without a clear connection.
* [LOGIC] The author assumes the reader is familiar with certain theological concepts and terminology, which may not be the case for all readers.
* [RELEVANCE] The inclusion of unrelated events, such as a keyboard clicking or a camera lens refocusing, disrupts the coherence of the text.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
