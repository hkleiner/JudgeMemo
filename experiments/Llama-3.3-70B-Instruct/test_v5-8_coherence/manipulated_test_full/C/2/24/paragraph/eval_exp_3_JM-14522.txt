1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the narrative sometimes jumps abruptly between scenes and ideas.
* [TRANSITION] There are places where the transition between paragraphs or scenes feels disjointed, lacking smooth connections.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow and understand.
* [LOGIC] The inclusion of modern technology terms (like "autonomous vehicle," "deepfake filter," "voice command," "backup drive," "AI core," "biosensor," "wireless charger," "self-driving cart") in a story set in the 19th century disrupts the coherence and historical consistency of the narrative.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
