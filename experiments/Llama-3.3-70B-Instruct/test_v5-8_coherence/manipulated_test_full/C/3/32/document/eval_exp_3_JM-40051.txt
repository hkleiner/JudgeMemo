1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and descriptions presented in a disjointed manner.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing, with sentences that are overly long and convoluted.
* [LOGIC] The author's arguments and claims are not always logically consistent, with some points seeming to be contradictory or unsupported.
