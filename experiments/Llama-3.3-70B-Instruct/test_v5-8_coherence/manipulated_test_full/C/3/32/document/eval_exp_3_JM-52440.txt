1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of the real presence, adoration, and sacrifice, without clear connections between them.
* [LOGIC] The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrines, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* [REPETITION] Some points, such as the distinction between the outward sign and inward grace, are repeated multiple times, which can make the text feel repetitive.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
