1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a collection of chapters from a book, but there are abrupt transitions between some chapters and sections, disrupting the flow.
* [LOGIC] Some parts of the story, such as the ghost's backstory and the prophecy, feel disconnected from the main plot and could be more clearly integrated.
* [CLARITY] Certain sentences and paragraphs are wordy or contain tangential information, making it difficult to follow the narrative at times.
* [TRANSITION] The shift from the ghost's attempts to scare the family to Virginia's interaction with the ghost and the resolution of the story feels somewhat abrupt.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
