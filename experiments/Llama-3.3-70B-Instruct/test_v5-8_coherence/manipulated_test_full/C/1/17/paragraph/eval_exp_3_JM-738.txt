1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and contains multiple tangents, making it difficult to follow the main argument.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt, disrupting the flow of the text.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, obscuring their intended meaning.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the story of Edwin Drood and its author, Charles Dickens, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.
* [RELEVANCE] Certain sections, such as the discussion of Millet's art, seem unrelated to the main topic of the Mystery of Edwin Drood.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
