1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt shifts between different ideas and topics.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often unclear or missing, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [CLARITY] The text contains many ambiguous and unclear sentences, which can make it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [LOGIC] The author's arguments and claims are not always logically consistent, and some statements seem to be based on assumptions rather than evidence.
* [RELEVANCE] The text includes many tangential and irrelevant passages, which can disrupt the flow of the main argument.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
