1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and topics seemingly disconnected and presented in a disjointed manner.
* [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing, with sentences that are overly long and convoluted, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [LOGIC] The author's arguments and claims are not well-supported by evidence and often rely on unsubstantiated assertions and assumptions.
* [RELEVANCE] The text includes numerous tangents and irrelevant details that detract from the main topic and make it difficult to maintain focus.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
