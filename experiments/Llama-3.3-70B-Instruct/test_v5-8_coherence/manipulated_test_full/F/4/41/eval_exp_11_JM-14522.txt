1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the narrative jumps abruptly between scenes and plot developments.
* [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the story, making it feel disjointed at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex vocabulary, which can make them difficult to understand.
* [LOGIC] The plot relies on supernatural elements and convenient coincidences, which may strain the reader's suspension of disbelief.
* [CONSISTENCY] The characterizations of the Otis family and the ghost are consistent, but some supporting characters feel one-dimensional.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
