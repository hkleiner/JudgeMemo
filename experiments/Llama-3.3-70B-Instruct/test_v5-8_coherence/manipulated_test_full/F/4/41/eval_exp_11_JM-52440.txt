1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice, without clear connections between them.
* [LOGIC] The author's arguments against the doctrine of the Real Presence are sometimes repetitive and could be more concise.
* [LEXICON] The text uses specialized theological vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
