1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the narrative jumps abruptly between scenes and plot developments.
* [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the story, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, which can confuse the reader.
* [LOGIC] The plot relies on supernatural elements and convenient coincidences, which may strain the reader's suspension of disbelief.
* [CONSISTENCY] The tone of the story shifts between humorous, serious, and sentimental, which can be jarring.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
