1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is a collection of autobiographical chapters and lacks a clear overarching narrative structure.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections can be abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, which can hinder understanding.
* [LOGIC] The text jumps between different time periods and topics, which can disrupt the logical flow of the narrative.
* [LEXICON] The use of outdated terms and phrases may cause confusion for modern readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
