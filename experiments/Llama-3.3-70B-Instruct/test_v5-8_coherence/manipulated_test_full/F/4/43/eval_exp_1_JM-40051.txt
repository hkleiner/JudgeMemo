1) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, such as the description of the Garden of Eden, the author's personal experiences, and the geological features of the area.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and organized structure, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.
* [CLARITY] The writing is often unclear and confusing, with long, convoluted sentences and vague descriptions.
* [TRANSITION] The text fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
* [RELEVANCE] Some information, such as the discussion of dairy farming and butter production, seems unrelated to the main topic of the Garden of Eden.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
