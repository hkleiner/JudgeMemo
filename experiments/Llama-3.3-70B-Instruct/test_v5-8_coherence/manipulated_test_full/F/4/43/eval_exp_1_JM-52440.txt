1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is lengthy and divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters and sections could be smoother.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of the real presence, adoration, and sacrifice, without clear connections between them.
* [REPETITION] Some ideas and quotes are repeated, which could be avoided for better coherence.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrines, which might make it hard for some readers to follow.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
