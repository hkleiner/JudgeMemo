1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the narrative sometimes jumps abruptly between scenes and ideas.
* [TRANSITION] There are places where the transition between paragraphs or scenes feels disjointed, lacking smooth connections.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow and understand.
* [LOGIC] The story involves supernatural elements, which, while coherent within the fantasy context, may challenge readers expecting realistic narratives.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
