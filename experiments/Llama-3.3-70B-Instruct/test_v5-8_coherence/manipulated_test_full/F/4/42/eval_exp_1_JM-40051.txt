1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and descriptions presented in a disjointed manner.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous ambiguous and unclear statements, which can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.
- [LOGIC] The author's arguments and claims are not always supported by logical reasoning or evidence, which can undermine the text's credibility.
- [RELEVANCE] Some sections of the text appear to be tangential or unrelated to the main topic, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
