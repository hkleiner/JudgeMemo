1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs.
- [TRANSITION] The author jumps abruptly from discussing the discovery of the Garden of Eden to describing its location and scenery.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and confusing, making it difficult to understand the author's point.
- [LOGIC] The author's arguments and conclusions are not always supported by logical reasoning or evidence.
- [LEXICON] The text contains some archaic or obscure vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
