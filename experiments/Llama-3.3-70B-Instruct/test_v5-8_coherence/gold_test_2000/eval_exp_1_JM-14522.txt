1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from introducing the characters and setting to discussing the ghost and its appearances, with little transition.
* [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter I to Chapter II feels somewhat disconnected, as the story moves from introducing the setting and characters to delving into the mystery of the ghost without a clear link.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow and understand.
* [LOGIC] The character of Mr. Otis sometimes behaves in ways that are not entirely logical or consistent with his previously established personality, such as his nonchalant reaction to seeing the ghost.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
