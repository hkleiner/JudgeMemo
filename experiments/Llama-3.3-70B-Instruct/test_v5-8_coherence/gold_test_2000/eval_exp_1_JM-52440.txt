1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas and concepts without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow at times.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain complex theological concepts that may be hard for non-experts to understand.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the general concept of sacraments to focusing specifically on the Lord's Supper could be smoother.
- [LOGIC] The argumentation relies heavily on the interpretation of specific religious texts and doctrines, which may not be universally accepted or understood.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
