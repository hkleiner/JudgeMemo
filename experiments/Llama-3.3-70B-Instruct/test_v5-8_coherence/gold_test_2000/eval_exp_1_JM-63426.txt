1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different periods of Will Bradley's life without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple ideas, making them hard to follow.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to his personal biography feels disjointed.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of detailed anecdotes from Bradley's childhood, while charming, sometimes disrupts the flow of the narrative about his career and influence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
