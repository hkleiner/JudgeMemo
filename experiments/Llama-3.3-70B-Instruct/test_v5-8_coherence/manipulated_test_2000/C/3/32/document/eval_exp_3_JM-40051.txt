1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and confusing, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
- [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the Bible and the location of the Garden of Eden to describing the geography and scenery of the Mississippi River valley.
- [LOGIC] The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly developed and relies on vague references to the Bible and geography.
- [REPETITION] The text repeats certain phrases and ideas, such as the description of the scenery, without adding new information or insights.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
