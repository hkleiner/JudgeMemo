1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different periods of Will Bradley's life without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making them hard to understand.
- [TRANSITION] The shift between the introduction and the chapter about the boy printer is not smooth.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of detailed anecdotes, such as the description of eating lobster or buying a suit, may not be directly relevant to the main point of the text.
- [LEXICON] The use of colloquial expressions and slang (e.g., "stuff", "thing") can be confusing.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
