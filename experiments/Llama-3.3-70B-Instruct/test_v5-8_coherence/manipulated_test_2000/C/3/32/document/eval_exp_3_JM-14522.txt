1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters without a clear connection
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow
* [TRANSITION] The story jumps between different topics, such as the family's conversation and the ghost's appearance, without smooth transitions
* [LOGIC] The character's reactions to the ghost's appearance seem unrealistic and inconsistent with their previous beliefs
2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
