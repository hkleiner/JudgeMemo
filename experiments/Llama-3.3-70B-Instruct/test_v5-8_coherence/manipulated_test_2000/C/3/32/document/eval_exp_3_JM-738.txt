1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and scenes, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, leading to confusion about the main point being made.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the start of the story is not smooth, with the author providing background information on Dickens before diving into the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and terms, such as "stuff" and "thing", can be confusing for modern readers and disrupts the flow of the text.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers, potentially leading to confusion.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
