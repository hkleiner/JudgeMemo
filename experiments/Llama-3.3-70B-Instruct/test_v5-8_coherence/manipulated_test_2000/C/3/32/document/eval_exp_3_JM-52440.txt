1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas and concepts without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain complex phrases, which can lead to confusion.
* [TRANSITION] The author sometimes switches between discussing the Church of England's doctrine and the author's own beliefs without clear indication.
* [LOGIC] There are instances where the author's arguments seem to be based on assumptions rather than explicit evidence from the Church of England's documents.
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and theological terminology may hinder understanding for some readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
