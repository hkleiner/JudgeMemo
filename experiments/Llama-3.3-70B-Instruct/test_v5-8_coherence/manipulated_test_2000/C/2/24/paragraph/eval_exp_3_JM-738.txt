1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and scenes, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases or sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs, which can make the text feel disjointed.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex vocabulary, which can make them hard to understand.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which can make it difficult for readers without this background to follow.
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and terms (e.g. "lay precentor", "gamin") may be unfamiliar to some readers, potentially disrupting the flow of the text.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
