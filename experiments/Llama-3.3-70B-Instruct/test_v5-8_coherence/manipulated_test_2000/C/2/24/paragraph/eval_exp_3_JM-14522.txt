1) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Introduction of unrelated modern elements like a hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera seems out of place in the narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from describing the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to detailing their daily life and interactions with the ghost without a smooth transition.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, making them hard to follow.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Chapter I to Chapter II feels somewhat abrupt without a clear connection between the events of the two chapters.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
