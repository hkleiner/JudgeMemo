1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and ideas without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making them hard to understand.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of unrelated details, such as the description of the energy grid and the livestream, disrupts the flow of the narrative.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to his personal biography feels disjointed.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
