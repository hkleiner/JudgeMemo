1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from the introduction of the Canterville ghost story to a completely unrelated passage about Dickens and his writing style
* [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the different scenes and chapters, making it difficult to follow the narrative
* [LOGIC] Inclusion of unrelated and seemingly random topics, such as the comparison of Christmas and summer holidays, which disrupt the flow of the story
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and unclear, making it hard to understand the intended meaning
* [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent tone and style throughout the text, ranging from humorous and lighthearted to dark and mysterious

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
