1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and storylines, making it difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases or sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making it hard to understand their meaning.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes prior knowledge of Dickens's life and works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic vocabulary and complex literary references may confuse some readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
