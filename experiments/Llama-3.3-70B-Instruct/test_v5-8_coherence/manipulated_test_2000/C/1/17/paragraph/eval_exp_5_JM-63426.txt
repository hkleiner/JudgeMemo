1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from discussing Will Bradley's career to a narrative about a character named Stransom
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the introduction and the chapter about the boy printer of Ishpeming
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of unrelated story elements, such as the tale of Sir Simon and the description of the jeweller's window
- [CLARITY] Unclear purpose of including detailed descriptions of the protagonist's childhood and daily life
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative flow due to the combination of biographical information and fictional storytelling

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
