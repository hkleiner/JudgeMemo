1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, jumping between different topics and ideas without smooth transitions.
* [LOGIC] The connection between the Garden of Eden and the description of the Mississippi River valley is not clearly explained.
* [CLARITY] The text includes unrelated and confusing passages, such as the descriptions of Jasper and Rosa, and the story about George Stransom.
* [TRANSITION] The text fails to provide clear transitions between different sections and ideas, making it difficult to follow.
* [RELEVANCE] The inclusion of unrelated stories and characters disrupts the coherence of the text and makes it hard to understand the main point.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2
