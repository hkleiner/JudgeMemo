1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and scenes, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are not always smooth, leading to a sense of disjointedness.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* [LEXICON] The use of archaic language and vocabulary may cause confusion for some readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
