1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's doctrine to a detailed analysis of sacraments without a clear transition.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [TRANSITION] The shift from introducing the topic to delving into specific biblical references and theological concepts feels disjointed.
* [LEXICON] The use of complex theological terminology without explanation may confuse readers unfamiliar with these concepts.
* [LOGIC] The argument against the doctrine of the Real Presence could be more clearly outlined, with some points feeling somewhat repetitive or unclear in their connection to the main argument.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
