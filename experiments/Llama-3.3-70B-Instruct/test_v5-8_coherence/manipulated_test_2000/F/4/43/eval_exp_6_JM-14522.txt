1) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] Inconsistent narrative flow due to abrupt transitions between scenes and ideas
* [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chapter division, as indicated by "CHAPTER: nothing" and the disjointed continuation of the story
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making them hard to follow
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from describing the family's daily life to the appearance of the ghost without a smooth transition
* [LEXICON] Use of outdated or less common vocabulary that may hinder understanding for some readers

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
