1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt shifts between different ideas and topics.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are often unclear or missing, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences and paragraphs are wordy and confusing, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
- [LOGIC] The author's arguments and conclusions are not always logically sound, with some claims seeming to be based on assumptions or unproven assertions.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors and awkwardly phrased sentences that disrupt the flow of the text.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
