1) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and scenes, making it difficult to follow at times.
* [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases or sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs, which can make the text feel disjointed.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex vocabulary, which can make them hard to understand.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
* [LEXICON] There are some archaic words and phrases used, such as "demned outline" and "hab nab at a venture", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
