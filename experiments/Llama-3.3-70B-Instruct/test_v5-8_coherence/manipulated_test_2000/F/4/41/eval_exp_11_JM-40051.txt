1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and confusing, making it difficult to understand the author's point.
- [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics, such as the biblical description of the Garden of Eden and the author's personal discovery, without smooth transitions.
- [LEXICON] The use of obscure words and phrases, such as "antldiluvians" and "princopak facts", may confuse some readers.
- [LOGIC] The author's argument relies on assumptions and speculations, rather than concrete evidence, which may undermine the text's coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
