1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of examining the Church of England's doctrine to a detailed analysis of sacraments without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from introducing the topic to delving into specific biblical references and theological concepts could be smoother.
- [LEXICON] The use of complex theological terminology might confuse readers not familiar with the subject matter.
- [LOGIC] The argumentation relies heavily on the interpretation of specific church documents and biblical passages, which might not be universally accepted as the sole basis for understanding the Church of England's doctrine.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
