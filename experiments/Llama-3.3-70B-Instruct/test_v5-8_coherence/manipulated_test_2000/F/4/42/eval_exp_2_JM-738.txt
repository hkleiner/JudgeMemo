1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and time periods, making it difficult to follow.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are sometimes unclear, leading to a sense of disjointedness.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex vocabulary, which can make them hard to understand.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, and inconsistent verb tenses.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
