Analysis: The text exhibits a high level of coherence, with the author presenting a clear and well-structured argument for the location of the Garden of Eden. The narrative flows logically, and the author provides a wealth of descriptive details to support their claim. The text is divided into sections that explore different aspects of the garden, its surroundings, and its significance, making it easy to follow the author's line of reasoning. However, the text is lengthy and meandering at times, with some sections feeling like tangents. The author's writing style is often poetic and descriptive, which can make the text feel more like a travelogue than a formal argument.

Rating: 4
