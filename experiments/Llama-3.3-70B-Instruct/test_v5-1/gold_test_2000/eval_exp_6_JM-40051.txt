Analysis: The story exhibits a clear and logical sequence of ideas, with the author presenting their discovery of the Garden of Eden in a well-structured narrative. The text is divided into sections that flow smoothly, and the author provides a clear progression from one idea to the next. However, the story is somewhat repetitive, with the author reiterating their claims and descriptions of the garden. The use of biblical references and geographical descriptions adds to the coherence of the narrative, but some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which may hinder the reader's understanding.
