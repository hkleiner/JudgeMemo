Analysis: The text exhibits a high level of coherence, with the author presenting a clear and well-structured argument for the location of the Garden of Eden. The narrative flows logically, and the author provides a wealth of descriptive details to support their claim. The text is divided into sections that explore different aspects of the garden, its surroundings, and its significance, making it easy to follow the author's line of reasoning. However, the text could benefit from more concise language and paragraphing to improve its overall readability.

Rating: 4
