Analysis: The story lacks coherence as it jumps abruptly between different scenes, characters, and topics without a clear connection or transition. The narrative starts with a conversation, then shifts to a discussion about the Church of England, followed by a completely unrelated story about a ghost, and finally ends with a character's introspection. This disjointedness makes it difficult to follow the story and understand its overall structure. The fluency of the text is also affected by the lack of smooth transitions and the presence of long, complex sentences that can be hard to read.
