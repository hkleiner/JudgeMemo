After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes overly complex vocabulary and repetitive language, which can make it hard to understand.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or ambiguous, leading to confusion about the author's intended meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs.
2. [LOGIC] The author's arguments and claims are not always well-supported or logically connected.
3. [TRANSITION] The text often jumps between different topics or ideas without clear connections or transitions.
4. [CLARITY] The author's writing style is sometimes unclear or vague, making it difficult to understand the main points or arguments.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some coherence in its overall theme and message, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

Note: The scores are based on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), with 3 indicating a moderate level of coherence and 2 indicating a lower level of fluency.
