The given text is a narrative story, "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. After carefully reading the story, several issues affecting the fluency and coherence scores have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The story is divided into chapters, which may disrupt the flow for some readers, but overall, it contributes to the narrative's organization.
2. **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between chapters and scenes are generally smooth, but some sentences feel disconnected, such as the abrupt shift from describing the family's daily life to the ghost's backstory.
3. **[LEXICON]**: The text features a wide range of vocabulary, including some archaic and less common words (e.g., "phantasmata," "sanguineous," "gibber"), which may hinder readability for some readers.
4. **[GRAMMAR]**: The narrative is mostly free of grammatical errors, but some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, which can affect fluency.
5. **[CLARITY]**: Certain passages, such as the ghost's monologues and the descriptions of his past actions, can be confusing due to their complexity and the use of figurative language.
6. **[LOGIC]**: The story's supernatural elements and the ghost's behavior may seem illogical or inconsistent to some readers, but this is a common aspect of ghost stories and fantasy narratives.
7. **[SYNTAX]**: Sentence structure is varied, with a mix of short and long sentences, which generally contributes to the narrative's rhythm and flow.

Considering these points, the final scores are:
