The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is divided into chapters and sections, but the transitions between them could be smoother. The author jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to adoration and sacrifice.
2. **[TRANSITION]**: The connections between paragraphs are not always clear, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. Transitional phrases and sentences could be used more effectively to guide the reader.
3. **[LEXICON]**: The text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which may make it challenging for modern readers to understand. Some words and phrases, such as "sorely tried by internal difficulties" and "doctrinal antipathies," may require clarification or explanation.
4. **[CLARITY]**: The author assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its history, and its doctrines. Readers without this knowledge may find it difficult to follow the discussion.
5. **[GRAMMAR]**: The text is generally well-written, but there are some long and convoluted sentences that could be broken up for better clarity.
6. **[REPETITION]**: The author repeats some points, such as the distinction between the real presence and transubstantiation, which could be condensed or rephrased for better effect.
7. **[COHERENCE]**: The text could benefit from a clearer thesis statement or main argument. The author's purpose is to examine the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper, but the discussion sometimes meanders or becomes bogged down in details.

Despite these issues, the text is well-researched and provides a detailed analysis of the Church of England's doctrine. The author's passion and commitment to the subject are evident throughout the text.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The coherence score is higher because the text ultimately presents a clear and well-supported argument, even if the structure and transitions could be improved. The fluency score is lower due to the challenges posed by the text's formal style, complex sentences, and assumptions about the reader's background knowledge.
