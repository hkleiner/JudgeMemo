The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, several issues affecting fluency and coherence have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is divided into chapters and sections, but the transitions between them could be smoother, and the connections between ideas are sometimes unclear.
2. **[LEXICON]**: The language is formal and often archaic, which may make it difficult for modern readers to understand. Some words and phrases, such as "stuff" (likely referring to the Church of England), are used repeatedly without clear explanation.
3. **[CLARITY]**: The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England, its history, and theological debates, which may confuse readers without a strong background in these areas.
4. **[TRANSITION]**: The author jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation, adoration, and sacrifice, without always providing clear connections between them.
5. **[GRAMMAR]**: The text contains some long, convoluted sentences that can be hard to follow, and there are instances of repetitive language and phrases.
6. **[LOGIC]**: The author's arguments and conclusions are not always clearly supported by evidence, and some points seem to be based on assumptions rather than explicit statements from the Church of England's documents.
7. **[SYNTAX]**: The text features complex sentence structures, which can make it challenging to understand the author's intended meaning.

Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a clear and consistent argumentative thread, and the author provides extensive references to the Church of England's documents to support their claims.
