3. **[TRANSITION]**: The text jumps between different ideas and theories, which can be disorienting for the reader.
4. **[LEXICON]**: The language used is often formal and academic, which may not be accessible to all readers.
5. **[GRAMMAR]**: There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses.
6. **[SYNTAX]**: The sentence structure is sometimes awkward, with long sentences that contain multiple clauses.
7. **[LOGIC]**: Some of the theories presented seem to be based on assumptions or speculation, rather than concrete evidence.
