As for coherence, the text has the following issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps back and forth in time, and the transitions between chapters or sections can be abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The author assumes the reader is familiar with the historical context and the subject's life, which can make it difficult to follow for those without prior knowledge.
- [TRANSITION] The connections between ideas and events are not always clear, and the text could benefit from more explicit transitions and summaries.
- [CLARITY] The text includes many names, dates, and events, which can be overwhelming and make it hard to discern the main themes and ideas.
