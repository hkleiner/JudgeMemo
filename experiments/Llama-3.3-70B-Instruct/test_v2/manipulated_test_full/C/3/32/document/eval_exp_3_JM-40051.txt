After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes repetitive and redundant language, which can make it tedious to read.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and unclear, requiring multiple readings to understand their meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics, disrupting the flow of the narrative.
2. [STRUCTURE] The organization of the text is unclear, with no apparent logical structure or transitions between sections.
3. [TRANSITION] The author fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the argument.
4. [CLARITY] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the topic, which can make it inaccessible to readers without background information.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some coherence in its overall argument and theme, and the author's passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter are evident.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
