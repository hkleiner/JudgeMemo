The given text is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, several issues affecting its fluency and coherence have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the discussion of the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice, without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow.
2. **[TRANSITION]**: The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and chapters, which disrupts the flow of the argument.
3. **[LEXICON]**: Some sentences are wordy and contain complex vocabulary, which may hinder understanding for non-expert readers.
4. **[SYNTAX]**: Certain sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to parse and comprehend.
5. **[CLARITY]**: The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and historical context, which may confuse readers without this knowledge.
6. **[LOGIC]**: The argumentation is sometimes repetitive, with similar points being made multiple times, which can make the text feel redundant.
7. **[GRAMMAR]**: There are a few instances of outdated or formal language, which may affect the text's readability.

Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a clear and well-organized argument, with the author carefully examining the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper. The text also shows a good use of quotes and references to support the argument.
