After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes words and phrases that are no longer commonly used or are used in an outdated manner, which can make the text seem archaic and less engaging.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous language, leading to confusion about the author's intended meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and topics introduced abruptly or without clear connections to the preceding text.
2. [TRANSITION] The author often fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making the text feel disjointed.
3. [LOGIC] The text contains logical fallacies and unsupported claims, which can undermine the author's credibility and make the text less persuasive.
4. [RELEVANCE] Some sections of the text seem unrelated to the main topic or are overly focused on tangential details, which can make the text feel meandering.

Considering these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text's lack of coherence and fluency makes it challenging to follow and understand the author's arguments and ideas. While the author attempts to present a compelling case for the location of the Garden of Eden, the numerous errors, awkward sentence structures, and logical fallacies detract from the text's overall effectiveness.
