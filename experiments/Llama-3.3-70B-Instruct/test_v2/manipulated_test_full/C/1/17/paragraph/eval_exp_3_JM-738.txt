The given text is an analysis of Charles Dickens's unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The analysis is written by Andrew Lang and presents his theory on the mystery and its possible solution.

Here are the issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is a collection of chapters and sections that seem to be loosely connected. The transitions between them could be smoother, and the overall structure could be more cohesive.
2. **[CLARITY]**: Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the sentence "If I must make a guess, I conjecture that Jasper had one of his “filmy” seizures, was “in a frightful sort of dream,” and bungled the murder: made an incomplete job of it." could be broken up for better clarity.
3. **[LEXICON]**: The text uses some archaic language and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers, such as "ficelle" and "gamin".
4. **[TRANSITION]**: The text jumps abruptly from discussing the story to analyzing the cover design by Charles Collins, without a clear connection between the two topics.
5. **[LOGIC]**: Some of the author's arguments and theories seem to be based on assumptions or conjectures, rather than solid evidence. For example, the theory that Jasper's mother was the opium-eating woman is presented as a possibility, but not supported by concrete evidence.
6. **[GRAMMAR]**: There are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.
7. **[SYNTAX]**: The sentence structure is sometimes awkward, with long sentences that contain multiple clauses.

Despite these issues, the text is still engaging and presents an interesting analysis of the novel.
