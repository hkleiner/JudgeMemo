After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues:

Fluency issues:
1. The text is written in a mix of first-person and second-person narrative styles, which can be confusing for the reader [CLARITY].
2. There are many abrupt transitions between different time periods and topics, making it difficult to follow the narrative [TRANSITION].
3. The text includes many tangential comments and asides, which can disrupt the flow of the story [STRUCTURE].
4. Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which can slow down the reader [SYNTAX].
5. The text includes many proper nouns and technical terms, which can be unfamiliar to some readers and slow down their comprehension [LEXICON].

Coherence issues:
1. The text jumps back and forth between different time periods and topics, making it difficult to understand the overall structure of the narrative [STRUCTURE].
2. Some events and characters are introduced without clear context or explanation, which can be confusing for the reader [CLARITY].
3. The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the printing industry and its history, which can make it difficult for non-experts to follow [LOGIC].
4. The narrative is sometimes hard to follow due to the lack of clear connections between different events and ideas [LOGIC].
5. The text includes many digressions and tangents, which can make it difficult to identify the main thread of the narrative [STRUCTURE].

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
