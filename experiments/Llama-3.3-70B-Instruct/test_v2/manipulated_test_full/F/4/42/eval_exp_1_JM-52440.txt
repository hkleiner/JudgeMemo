The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, several issues affecting fluency and coherence have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text is divided into chapters, but the transitions between them could be smoother. The discussion jumps abruptly from one topic to another, making it difficult to follow at times.
2. **[CLARITY]**: Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them hard to understand. For example, the sentence "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching" could be simplified for better clarity.
3. **[LEXICON]**: The text employs a formal, somewhat archaic tone, which may make it challenging for modern readers to comprehend. Words like "whilst," "thou," and "thee" are used, which, although correct in their context, contribute to the text's overall complexity.
4. **[GRAMMAR]**: There are instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation issues, which detract from the text's fluency.
5. **[TRANSITION]**: The text often lacks clear transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to see how the different ideas are connected.
6. **[LOGIC]**: Some arguments seem to be based on assumptions rather than explicit evidence from the Church of England's documents, which may weaken the text's coherence.
7. **[REPETITION]**: Certain points, such as the distinction between the sign and the thing signified in sacraments, are repeated multiple times, which, while reinforcing the argument, also makes the text feel somewhat repetitive.

Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a clear and well-structured argument regarding the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, with the author carefully examining various documents and providing detailed analysis.
