After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes words and phrases that are no longer commonly used or are overly formal, which can make it hard to understand for modern readers.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous language, leading to confusion about the author's intended meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and topics jumping abruptly from one to another.
2. [TRANSITION] The author fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it challenging to follow the argument.
3. [LOGIC] The text contains logical fallacies, such as assuming that the presence of certain features (e.g., a river, hills) is sufficient evidence to prove that the described location is the Garden of Eden.
4. [RELEVANCE] Some sections of the text seem unrelated to the main topic or are overly focused on minor details, disrupting the overall flow of the argument.

Considering these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text struggles with both coherence and fluency, making it a challenging read. While the author attempts to present a compelling argument, the numerous errors, awkward sentence structures, and lack of clear transitions hinder the text's overall effectiveness.
