- [SYNTAX] There are some long, convoluted sentences that can be difficult to follow, such as the ones describing Bradley's early life and career.
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains some grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.

Regarding coherence, the text has some issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps back and forth between different periods of Bradley's life, which can make it hard to follow.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are sometimes abrupt, lacking clear connections between ideas.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes some background knowledge of the time period, printing industry, and design terminology, which might not be familiar to all readers.

Despite these issues, the text provides a detailed and engaging account of Will Bradley's life and career.
