The text provided is a lengthy and complex theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence.

Fluency issues:
- [LEXICON] The text features a high level of technical vocabulary and complex theological jargon, which may hinder comprehension for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
- [GRAMMAR] There are instances of archaic language and grammatical structures, which may cause confusion for modern readers.
- [CLARITY] Certain passages lack clear and concise explanations, leading to potential misunderstandings.

Coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation, adoration, and sacrifice, without clear transitions or connections.
- [LOGIC] The author's arguments and conclusions are not always clearly supported by evidence or logical reasoning.
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections, making it difficult to follow the author's line of thought.
- [CLARITY] The author's use of ambiguous terms and concepts, such as "real presence" and "sacrament," may lead to confusion and misinterpretation.

Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a clear and consistent argumentative structure, with the author presenting a well-defined thesis and supporting it with references to Church documents and theological concepts.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
