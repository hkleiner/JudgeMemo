The given text is an analysis of Charles Dickens's unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang. Here are the issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text is quite long and dense, with many sections and subsections that may make it difficult to follow for some readers.
2. **[TRANSITION]** The transitions between sections and ideas could be smoother, as the text sometimes jumps abruptly from one topic to another.
3. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are wordy or convoluted, which can make them hard to understand, e.g., "If I must make a guess, I conjecture that Jasper had one of his “filmy” seizures, was “in a frightful sort of dream,” and bungled the murder: made an incomplete job of it."
4. **[LEXICON]** The text uses some archaic vocabulary and phrases, such as "whilom" or "in sooth", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** There are a few instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb tenses, e.g., "He was, I think, to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow" should be "He was, I think, to have a lesson and become a good fellow".
6. **[LOGIC]** The text assumes a high level of familiarity with the original novel and its characters, which may make it difficult for readers who are not well-versed in Dickens's work to follow the analysis.
7. **[REPETITION]** Some ideas and points are repeated multiple times, which can make the text feel redundant and slow-paced.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with clear headings and a logical structure.
