After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes repetitive and redundant language, which can make it tedious to read.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or ambiguous, leading to confusion about the author's intended meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization, with ideas and topics introduced abruptly or without clear connections.
2. [TRANSITION] The author often fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it difficult to follow the argument.
3. [LOGIC] The text contains gaps in reasoning and lacks clear evidence to support the author's claims.
4. [CLARITY] The author's writing style is often vague or ambiguous, making it challenging to understand the main points.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some coherence in its overall argument and structure, and the author's passion and enthusiasm for the topic are evident.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

Note: The scores are based on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), with 3 indicating a moderate level of coherence and 2 indicating a lower level of fluency.
