The given text is an analysis of Charles Dickens's unfinished novel "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" by Andrew Lang. Here are the issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text is quite long and dense, with many sections and subsections that can make it difficult to follow. The structure is not always clear, and the transitions between sections can be abrupt.
2. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them hard to understand. For example, the sentence "If I must make a guess, I conjecture that Jasper had one of his “filmy” seizures, was “in a frightful sort of dream,” and bungled the murder: made an incomplete job of it." could be simplified for better clarity.
3. **[TRANSITION]** The text jumps between different topics and ideas without smooth transitions, which can disrupt the flow of the text. For instance, the discussion of Jasper's character is followed abruptly by an analysis of the cover design of the book.
4. **[LEXICON]** The text uses some archaic language and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to modern readers, such as "hyacinthine locks" and "Grecian nose". While this may be intended to evoke the style of Dickens's time, it can create a barrier to understanding for some readers.
5. **[LOGIC]** Some of the arguments and theories presented in the text rely on assumptions or speculations that are not fully supported by evidence. For example, the theory that Jasper's mother was the opium-eating woman is based on circumstantial evidence and may not be convincing to all readers.
6. **[GRAMMAR]** There are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the text, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
7. **[SYNTAX]** The sentence structure is sometimes awkward or unclear, which can make it difficult to follow the author's argument. For example, the sentence "The young man in the vault, on the other hand, wears a loose paletot, buttoned to the throat (vaults are chilly places), and the coat falls so as to cover the knees; at least, partially." could be rephrased for better clarity.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-researched and provides a detailed analysis of the novel. The author's passion for the subject matter is evident, and the text is engaging and thought-provoking.
