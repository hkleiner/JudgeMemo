The text provided is a lengthy and complex discussion on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. Here are the issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text is divided into chapters, but the transitions between them could be smoother. The author jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the real presence to adoration and then to sacrifice.
2. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "But though the questions are thus distinct, can we say the same of the answers?" could be simplified for better clarity.
3. **[LEXICON]** The text uses complex theological terminology, which may be unfamiliar to non-experts. While the author explains some terms, others are left unexplained, potentially confusing readers.
4. **[TRANSITION]** The text often lacks clear transitions between paragraphs, making it hard to see how the author's ideas are connected.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** There are a few instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect verb tenses, which can disrupt the flow of the text.
6. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences have awkward phrasing, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, the sentence "The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined" is a long, convoluted sentence that could be broken up for better readability.
7. **[LOGIC]** The author's argument is not always easy to follow, with some points feeling disconnected from the rest of the discussion.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with the author providing clear explanations of complex theological concepts.
