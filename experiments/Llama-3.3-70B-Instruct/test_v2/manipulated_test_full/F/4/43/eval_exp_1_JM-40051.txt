After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes words and phrases that are no longer commonly used or are used in an outdated manner, which can make the text seem archaic and less engaging.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous language, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and topics seemingly introduced at random.
2. [TRANSITION] The author often fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making the text feel disjointed.
3. [LOGIC] The author's arguments and conclusions are not always well-supported or logically consistent.
4. [REDUNDANCY] The text contains repetitive information and ideas, which can make it feel tedious and overly long.

Despite these issues, the text does demonstrate some coherence and fluency, particularly in its descriptive passages and when discussing specific topics related to the Garden of Eden.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

Note: The scores are subjective and based on my evaluation of the text. A score of 1 indicates significant problems, while a score of 5 indicates excellent quality.
