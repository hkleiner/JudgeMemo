2. **[GRAMMAR]**: There are a few instances of grammatical errors, such as missing or misplaced articles, and some sentences are structured in a way that makes them hard to follow.
3. **[LEXICON]**: The vocabulary is rich and varied, but some words and phrases may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which could affect fluency.
4. **[CLARITY]**: A few sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous phrasing, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
5. **[TRANSITION]**: The story jumps abruptly from the ghost's attempts to scare the family to Virginia's encounter with him, and then to the resolution of the story, which could be connected more smoothly.
6. **[LOGIC]**: Some events in the story, such as the ghost's behavior and the family's reactions, may seem illogical or inconsistent to some readers.
7. **[SYNTAX]**: The text features some long, complex sentences with multiple clauses, which can make it hard to follow the narrative.
