After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.
* [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [LEXICON] The text includes some archaic or obscure words, such as "antldiluvians" and "Havilah", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument is not always clear or well-supported, and some of the connections between ideas seem tenuous or arbitrary.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's overall argument.
* [CLARITY] Some of the language is vague or ambiguous, making it hard to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The text often lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the text does show some strengths in terms of its creativity and descriptive language. The author's use of vivid imagery and descriptive phrases, such as "the veritable Garden of Eden" and "the beau ideal of a garden", helps to create a sense of wonder and enchantment.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The coherence score is 3 because while the text has some clear and well-organized sections, it also has many areas where the ideas are disjointed or unclear. The fluency score is 2 because the text is often difficult to read due to its complex sentence structure, grammatical errors, and obscure vocabulary. Overall, the text could benefit from significant editing and revision to improve its clarity, coherence, and overall flow.
