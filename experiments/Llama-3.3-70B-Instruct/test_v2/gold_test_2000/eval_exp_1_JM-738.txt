After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is dense and contains long, complex sentences that can be difficult to follow [SYNTAX].
* There are many references to external sources and allusions to other works of literature, which can make the text hard to understand for readers who are not familiar with them [CLARITY].
* The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, such as the discussion of Dickens's life and the analysis of his novel [TRANSITION].
* Some sentences are wordy and contain unnecessary phrases, which can make them hard to read [LEXICON].
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about Dickens and his works, which can make it inaccessible to readers who are not familiar with him [CLARITY].
* The use of quotes and references to other texts can be confusing and disrupt the flow of the text [STRUCTURE].
* The text contains some ambiguous phrases and sentences that can be interpreted in different ways [CLARITY].
* The author's tone and voice are not always clear, which can make it hard to understand their intentions and arguments [CLARITY].

Despite these issues, the text is well-organized and logical in its structure, with a clear introduction, analysis, and conclusion [STRUCTURE]. The author also provides many interesting insights and analysis of Dickens's novel, which shows their expertise and knowledge of the subject [COHERENCE].
