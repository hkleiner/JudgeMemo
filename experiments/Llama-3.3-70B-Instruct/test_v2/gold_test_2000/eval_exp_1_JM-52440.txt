After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which may make it difficult for modern readers to follow [LEXICON].
* Some sentences are very long and convoluted, making it hard to understand their meaning [SYNTAX].
* The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England, its doctrine, and the controversy surrounding the Real Presence, which may make it inaccessible to readers without this knowledge [CLARITY].
* The author jumps abruptly from discussing the general definition of a sacrament to examining specific Articles of the Church of England, without providing a clear transition [TRANSITION].
* The text includes many quotes and references to Scripture, which can disrupt the flow of the argument [STRUCTURE].
* The author's tone is sometimes argumentative and defensive, which may make the text feel less objective and more persuasive [CLARITY].
* The text could benefit from clearer headings and subheadings to help organize the argument and guide the reader [STRUCTURE].
* Some paragraphs are very long and could be broken up to improve the text's overall flow [STRUCTURE].
* The author uses technical terms like "consecration" and "sacramental appointment" without explaining them, which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these concepts [CLARITY].

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author provides a clear thesis statement and supports it with evidence from the Church of England's documents.
