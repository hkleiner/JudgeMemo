After carefully reading the story, I have identified the following issues:

* The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which may make it less accessible to modern readers [LEXICON].
* Some sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow [SYNTAX].
* The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the description of the haunted house, with little transition [TRANSITION].
* The character of Mrs. Umney is introduced somewhat suddenly, and her role in the story is not immediately clear [CLARITY].
* The story relies heavily on dialogue, which can make it feel a bit disjointed at times [STRUCTURE].
* The tone of the story is somewhat inconsistent, veering wildly from humor to horror [LOGIC].
* Some of the language and descriptions are overly elaborate, which can make the text feel dense and overwhelming [LEXICON].
* The story assumes a certain level of cultural knowledge and historical context, which may not be familiar to all readers [CLARITY].

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative thread and well-developed characters. The author's use of language is often clever and engaging, and the story has a clear tone and atmosphere.
