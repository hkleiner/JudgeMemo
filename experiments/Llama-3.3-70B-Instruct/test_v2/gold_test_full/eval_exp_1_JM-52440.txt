The text provided is a lengthy and complex theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence.

Fluency issues:
- [LEXICON] The text features a high level of technical vocabulary and complex theological jargon, which may hinder comprehension for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are lengthy and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
- [GRAMMAR] There are instances of repetitive sentence structures and word choices, which can lead to a sense of monotony.
- [CLARITY] Certain passages require close attention to understand the author's intended meaning, as the language is sometimes ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

Coherence issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters and sections, but the transitions between them could be smoother, and the connections between ideas are not always clear.
- [LOGIC] The author presents a detailed analysis of various Church documents, but the flow of the argument is occasionally disrupted by tangential comments or defensive asides.
- [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation, adoration, and sacrifice, without always providing clear connections between them.
- [CLARITY] The author's use of rhetorical questions and emphatic statements can make the text feel more like a persuasive tract than a neutral exposition of the Church's teaching.

Despite these issues, the text remains a thorough and well-researched exploration of the topic. The author demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter and presents a clear argument.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
