The given text is a narrative story, "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde. After carefully reading the story, several issues affecting the fluency and coherence scores have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]**: The story is divided into chapters, which may disrupt the flow for some readers, but overall, the structure is clear and easy to follow.
2. **[TRANSITION]**: Transitions between chapters and scenes are generally smooth, but some readers might find the shift from the ghost's backstory to the present day a bit abrupt.
3. **[CLARITY]**: A few sentences are wordy or contain complex vocabulary, which might confuse some readers (e.g., "the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena" or "the higher-natural world").
4. **[LEXICON]**: The text features some archaic or less common words (e.g., "phantasmata," "sanguineous," "gibber"), which may require readers to look up their meanings.
5. **[GRAMMAR]**: The narrative is generally well-punctuated and grammatically correct, but some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow.
6. **[LOGIC]**: The story's supernatural elements and the ghost's behavior might be seen as inconsistent or unexplained in some instances, but this is a common trait of ghost stories and does not significantly impact the overall coherence.
7. **[SYNTAX]**: Sentence construction is mostly varied and effective, but some sentences are lengthy and contain multiple clauses, which can affect readability.

Despite these issues, the story remains engaging, and the author's writing style is generally fluent and coherent.
