After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
2. [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
3. [LEXICON] The text includes words and phrases that are no longer commonly used or are overly formal, which can make it hard to understand for modern readers.
4. [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous language, leading to confusion about the author's intended meaning.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and topics jumping abruptly from one to another.
2. [TRANSITION] The author fails to provide smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it difficult to follow the flow of the text.
3. [LOGIC] The author's arguments and conclusions are not always well-supported or logical, which can make it hard to accept their claims.
4. [RELEVANCE] Some sections of the text seem unrelated to the main topic or are overly detailed, which can disrupt the coherence of the narrative.

Considering these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text requires significant improvement in both coherence and fluency to make it easier to read and understand. The author's ideas and arguments are often obscured by grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and a lack of clear transitions, which can make it challenging for readers to follow the text and appreciate its content.
