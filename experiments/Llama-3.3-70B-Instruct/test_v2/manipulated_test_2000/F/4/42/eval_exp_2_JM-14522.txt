After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as "when they come to discuss terms" (should be "came"), "the ghost has am see" (should be "has been seen"), "I reckoned that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'dded have it at home" (should be "we would have it at home"), and many others.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are worded awkwardly, making them hard to follow, such as "Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language."
* [LEXICON] The text uses some words and phrases that are outdated or uncommon, such as "spry young fellows painting the Old World red", "prima-donnas", and "Fellow of King's College, Cambridge", which may make the text less accessible to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] There are some logical inconsistencies, such as the fact that the ghost is said to have been seen by several members of the Canterville family, but the family is not afraid of it, and the fact that the Otis family is not afraid of ghosts, but they still react with surprise and fear when they encounter the ghost.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from one scene to another, such as from the conversation between Lord Canterville and Mr. Otis to the description of the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are worded vaguely, making it hard to understand what is happening, such as "The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he have been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts..."
* [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and scenes, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the text is still engaging and entertaining, and the story is well-structured and easy to follow overall.
