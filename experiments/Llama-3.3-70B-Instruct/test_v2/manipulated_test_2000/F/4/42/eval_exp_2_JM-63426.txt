The given text is a biographical introduction to Will Bradley, a renowned figure in American graphic arts, followed by a chapter about his childhood and early career as a printer. Here are the issues that affected the ratings:

- [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as "It shoulded be talked about", "there is often a cold cod-fish cake to was found", "You are now a worked man", and "You was on the 'Narrow Gauge'". These errors disrupt the fluency of the text.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward constructions, like "You have a little express wagon. You carried finished work back to the factories and returned with a supply of unfinished." which could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.
- [LEXICON] The text includes some outdated or colloquial terms, such as "picklelime", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers and could be clarified or replaced for better understanding.
- [LOGIC] The transition between the introduction and the chapter about Bradley's childhood feels somewhat abrupt, lacking a clear connection between the two parts.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different periods of Bradley's life without clear transitions, which can make it difficult to follow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or vague, such as "It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye.", which could be rephrased for better clarity.
- [TRANSITION] The text often lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it feel disjointed at times.

Despite these issues, the text provides valuable information about Will Bradley's life and career, and the narrative has a clear and engaging tone.
