The given text is a critical analysis of Charles Dickens's last novel, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood". The text is written in a formal and academic tone, with a complex structure and vocabulary. 

Issues affecting the ratings:
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "he certainly write", "he was conspicuously defunct"), incorrect use of tenses, and inconsistent subject-verb agreement.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow (e.g., "He was, presumably, acquaint with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how coulded he hoped to understand the sleepers?").
- [LEXICON] The text features some archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "hab nab at a venture", "the first sprightly runnings"), which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens's life and works, which may make it challenging for readers without this background to follow the analysis.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics and ideas, such as the analysis of Dickens's writing style, the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", and the author's personal life, which can make it difficult to follow the overall argument.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are ambiguous or unclear, requiring close reading and interpretation (e.g., "He see in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”").
- [TRANSITION] The text often lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, which can disrupt the flow of the argument.

Despite these issues, the text demonstrates a high level of coherence, with a clear overall structure and a well-developed argument. The author provides a detailed analysis of Dickens's writing style and the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", and raises interesting questions about the novel's unfinished state.
