After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as "am" instead of "is", "was" instead of "were", and "doth" instead of "does". These errors can make the text difficult to read and understand.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making it hard to follow the author's train of thought. For example, the sentence "The sign is not described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being accompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip visibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace invisibly to feed the soul and confirmed the faith" is a long and complex sentence that could be broken up for easier reading.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic language, such as "doth" and "thou", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers. While this may be intentional to convey a sense of formality or tradition, it can still make the text more difficult to understand.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrine, which may not be familiar to all readers. This can make it difficult for readers to follow the author's arguments and understand the context.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the Real Presence to discussing the Church of England's teachings on the subject. A clearer transition between these sections would help to improve the text's coherence.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning. For example, the sentence "The practical conclusion is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine" is unclear about what is meant by "in the bread and in the wine".
* [TRANSITION] The text could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs and sections. For example, the transition from the introduction to the first chapter is abrupt and could be smoothed out with a clearer summary of what is to come.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The author provides a clear overview of the topic and breaks it down into manageable sections. The text also demonstrates a clear and consistent tone and style.
