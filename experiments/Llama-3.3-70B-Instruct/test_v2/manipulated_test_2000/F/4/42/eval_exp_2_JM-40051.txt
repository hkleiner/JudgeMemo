After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect verb conjugations, incorrect sentence structures, and inconsistent use of tenses.
* [SYNTAX] The sentence construction is often awkward, with long, convoluted sentences that are difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text includes some archaic or obscure words and phrases, such as "antldiluvians" and "Havilah", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly developed, and the text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, with ideas and paragraphs seemingly disconnected from one another.
* [CLARITY] The writing is often vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between ideas and paragraphs, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the text does show some coherence in its overall theme and idea, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
