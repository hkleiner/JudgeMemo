After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the quality of the text. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] There are several typos and grammatical errors throughout the text, such as "wdll" instead of "will", "xnd" instead of "and", "simce" instead of "since", "fsw" instead of "few", "afger" instead of "after", "tuey" instead of "they", "reavhed" instead of "reached", "nonsensd" instead of "nonsense", "akl" instead of "all", "Myerw" instead of "Myers", and "Podmore" is correct but the sentence is incomplete.
* [LEXICON] Some words are used incorrectly or in an outdated manner, such as "swished" instead of "scolded" or "punished", and "guarfians" instead of "guardians".
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly constructed, making them hard to follow, such as the sentence describing the family's conversation topics.
* [CLARITY] Some phrases or sentences are vague or ambiguous, such as the description of the ghost's appearance and the family's reactions to it.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from one scene to another, such as from the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the stormy night, without clear transitions.
* [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs, making it feel disjointed at times.

Despite these issues, the story is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative thread and engaging characters. The author's use of humor and satire is also effective in creating a lighthearted and entertaining tone.
