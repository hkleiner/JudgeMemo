After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect punctuation, verb tense inconsistencies, and incorrect sentence structure.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or obscure vocabulary, which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly developed, and the text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, with ideas and paragraphs seeming to follow a stream-of-consciousness style rather than a logical progression.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The text often lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the text does show some coherence in its overall theme and idea, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The coherence score is 3 because, despite the lack of clear organization and logical flow, the text does have a clear overall theme and idea. The fluency score is 2 because the text is often difficult to read due to grammatical errors, wordy sentences, and unclear vocabulary. With some editing and revision to address these issues, the text could be much more effective in conveying the author's message.
