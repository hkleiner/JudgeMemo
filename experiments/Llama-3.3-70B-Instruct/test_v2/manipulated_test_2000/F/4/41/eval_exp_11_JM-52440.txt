After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes (e.g., "IR is a very easy thing" should be "It is a very easy thing").
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or uncommon vocabulary, such as "vommon" instead of "common", "establisjed" instead of "established", and "srrvice" instead of "service".
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly constructed, making them difficult to follow (e.g., "The issues st stake are far too serious, and, now that after three hundred years of faithful srrvice the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined.").
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning (e.g., "The practical conclusion is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine.").
* [TRANSITION] The text sometimes lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it feel disjointed (e.g., the transition from discussing the doctrine of the Real Presence to introducing the Church of England's teaching).
* [STRUCTURE] The text could benefit from a clearer structure, with more explicit headings and subheadings to guide the reader through the argument.
* [LOGIC] Some arguments or claims are not fully supported or explained, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning (e.g., the claim that the Church of England's teaching on the Lord's Supper is at variance with its general definition of a sacrament).

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The author's argument is also well-supported by references to Scripture and the Church of England's documents.
