After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains some long and convoluted sentences, which can make it difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "That the most precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and that the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone." could be broken up for better clarity.
* [SYNTAX] The text sometimes uses complex sentence structures, which can lead to confusion. For instance, the sentence "The thing soul hand with visibly so as is own faith believer, and it great to the and, sign when sign into invisibly lip accompanied in confirm described grace God feed not, the as it changed receives the the pleases being signified His by the but being the that" is difficult to understand due to its unclear syntax.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic language and vocabulary, such as "connexion" instead of "connection", which may make it harder for modern readers to understand.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England and its doctrine, which may make it difficult for readers without this background to follow the argument.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the general definition of a sacrament to examining specific Articles of the Church of England, which can disrupt the flow of the argument.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or vague, making it hard to discern their meaning. For example, the sentence "The water is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the consecration produces no change in its quality or substance" could be rephrased for better clarity.
* [TRANSITION] The text sometimes lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas, which can make it feel disjointed.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear argument and supporting evidence.
