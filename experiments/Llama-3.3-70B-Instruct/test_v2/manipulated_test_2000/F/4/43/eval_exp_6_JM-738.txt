After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes, which can make it difficult to follow.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making it hard to understand their meaning. For example, the sentence "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" is a bit confusing.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic vocabulary and phrases, such as "hab nab at a venture" and "the first sprightly runnings," which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] There are some unclear connections between ideas, such as the transition from discussing Dickens's writing style to describing the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the author's intentions to describing the characters and plot of the story, which can be disorienting.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, such as "The bloom is off the plum" of their prearranged loves, which requires some interpretation to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The text could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs and sections, as some of the connections between ideas feel abrupt or unclear.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas.
