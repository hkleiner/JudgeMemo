After carefully reading the text, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.
* [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic language and words that may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which can make it harder to understand.
* [LOGIC] The author's arguments and conclusions are not always clearly supported by evidence, and some of the connections between ideas seem tenuous.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics and ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's overall argument.
* [CLARITY] Some of the sentences are wordy or ambiguous, making it hard to understand what the author is trying to say.
* [TRANSITION] The text often lacks clear transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.
* [STRUCTURE] The text includes a section with garbled and incoherent sentences, which seems to be a printing error or a section that was not properly edited (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river “below greed,” on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to, ...").

Despite these issues, the text does show some coherence in its overall argument and structure, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.
