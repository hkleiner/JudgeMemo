- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and contain multiple clauses, making them difficult to follow, such as the sentence describing John Jasper's character.
- [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic vocabulary, such as "demned" and "gamin", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] The transition between paragraphs is sometimes weak, with little connection between the ideas presented in each paragraph.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have complex syntax, with multiple phrases and clauses, which can make them hard to understand.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens and his works, which may not be familiar to all readers.
