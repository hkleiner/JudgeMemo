After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent verb tenses.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow, while others are simple and lack variety.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some outdated or obscure vocabulary, such as "antldiluvians" and "Havilah", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly developed, and the text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, with ideas and paragraphs seeming to follow a stream-of-consciousness style rather than a logical progression.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The text often lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the text does show some coherence in its overall theme and idea, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
