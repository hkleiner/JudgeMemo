After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [STRUCTURE] The story jumps abruptly from the introduction of the characters to the description of the house and its history, without a clear connection between the two.
* [TRANSITION] The transition between the first and second chapters feels abrupt, with no clear indication of the passage of time or the shift in focus.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them hard to follow, such as the description of Mrs. Otis's appearance and background.
* [LEXICON] The use of words like "punctilious" and "sanguineous" may be unfamiliar to some readers, which could affect the text's fluency.
* [LOGIC] The character of Mr. Otis seems inconsistent, as he is initially skeptical of ghosts but later interacts with the ghost in a surprisingly calm and matter-of-fact way.
* [GRAMMAR] There are a few instances of awkward phrasing, such as the sentence "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive."
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences have complex structures, which can make them hard to follow, such as the sentence "The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured Americans of the better class..."
* [ANACHRONISM] The mention of modern technology, such as a "hologram", "bluetooth signal", and "surveillance camera", feels out of place in a story set in the past.

Despite these issues, the story has a clear and engaging narrative, and the author's use of language is generally vivid and descriptive.
