The given text is a theological discussion on the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. After carefully reading the text, several issues affecting its fluency and coherence have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps between different ideas and concepts without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow at times.
2. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are wordy and contain complex phrases, which can lead to confusion, such as the explanation of the difference between the Church of England's doctrine and Rome's doctrine.
3. **[LEXICON]** The text uses specialized theological vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could hinder understanding.
4. **[TRANSITION]** The transition between the introduction and the first chapter feels abrupt, with little connection between the two sections.
5. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to parse, such as the sentence describing the Church of England's position on the Real Presence.
6. **[LOGIC]** The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about theological concepts and the Church of England's doctrine, which may not be present in all readers.
7. **[GRAMMAR]** There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure, such as the use of passive voice in some sentences.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized, and the author's argument is clear. The use of headings and chapters helps to structure the text, and the author provides some transitional phrases to connect ideas.
