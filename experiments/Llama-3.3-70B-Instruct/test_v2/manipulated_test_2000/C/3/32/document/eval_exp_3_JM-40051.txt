After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
* [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple clauses that are not clearly connected.
* [LEXICON] The text includes some archaic or obscure words, such as "antldiluvians" and "Havilah", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The author's argument for the location of the Garden of Eden is not clearly developed, and the text jumps abruptly between different ideas and topics.
* [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, with ideas and paragraphs seemingly disconnected from one another.
* [CLARITY] The author's writing style is often vague and ambiguous, making it difficult to understand their intended meaning.
* [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it feel disjointed and hard to follow.
* [REPEAT] The author repeats certain phrases and ideas, such as the description of the scenery, which becomes repetitive and tedious.

Despite these issues, the text does show some coherence in its overall theme and idea, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction are evident throughout.
