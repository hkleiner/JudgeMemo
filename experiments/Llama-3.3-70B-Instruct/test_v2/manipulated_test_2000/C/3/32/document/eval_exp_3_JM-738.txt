After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of a thing, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" is hard to parse.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some obscure vocabulary, such as "precentor" and "gamin", which may be unfamiliar to some readers.
* [LOGIC] There are some unclear connections between ideas, such as the transition from discussing Dickens's writing style to analyzing the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the introduction of new characters and the analysis of the story's plot.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, such as "The bloom is off the plum" of their prearranged loves, which requires some interpretation to understand.
* [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs, making it feel disjointed at times.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-organized and easy to follow. The author provides a clear introduction to the topic and provides relevant context for the analysis of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood".
