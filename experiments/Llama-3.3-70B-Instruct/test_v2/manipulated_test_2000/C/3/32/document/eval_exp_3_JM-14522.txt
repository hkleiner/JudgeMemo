After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect the fluency and coherence of the text. Here are the issues I found:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation.
* [LEXICON] There are some instances of word choice that seem outdated or unusual, such as the use of "waggonette" instead of "wagon" or "carriage".
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are structured in a way that makes them difficult to follow, with multiple clauses and phrases that disrupt the flow of the text.
* [CLARITY] A few passages are unclear or ambiguous, such as the description of the ghost's appearance, which may be confusing for some readers.
* [TRANSITION] The text jumps abruptly from one scene to another, without clear transitions or connections between the different events.
* [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into chapters, but the division seems arbitrary, and the narrative could be improved with more logical sectioning.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written, and the story is engaging and easy to follow. The author's use of language is often humorous and witty, and the characters are well-developed and relatable.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 4

The coherence score is high because the story is well-organized, and the events are logically connected. The narrative flows smoothly, and the reader can easily follow the plot. The fluency score is also high because the text is generally well-written, and the language is clear and concise. However, the scores are not perfect due to the issues mentioned above, which affect the overall quality of the text.
