The given text is a biographical account of Will Bradley, a renowned figure in American graphic arts, and his journey from childhood to becoming a pioneer in his field. The text is divided into two chapters: "AN INTRODUCTION" and "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING."

Several issues affect the fluency and coherence of the text:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text jumps abruptly from discussing Will Bradley's impact on American graphic arts to a scene in London involving a character named Stransom, which seems unrelated to the main topic.
2. **[TRANSITION]** The transition between the introduction and the chapter "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" is weak, as the narrative shifts from a third-person perspective on Will Bradley to a first-person account of his childhood without a clear connection.
3. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous phrasing, making them hard to follow, such as the description of the shop-front in London.
4. **[LEXICON]** The use of outdated terms (e.g., "picklelime") and specific historical references (e.g., the trial of George A. Newett and Theodore Roosevelt) may confuse modern readers unfamiliar with these contexts.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** There are instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, which can disrupt the flow of reading.
6. **[LOGIC]** The inclusion of detailed descriptions of the protagonist's childhood activities and surroundings, while providing character background, sometimes feels excessive and slows the narrative pace.
7. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences have complex structures that can make them difficult to understand at first glance.

Despite these issues, the text maintains a certain charm and provides valuable insights into Will Bradley's life and contributions to American graphic arts. The narrative, especially in the second chapter, offers engaging anecdotes and a clear progression of Bradley's early life and career.
