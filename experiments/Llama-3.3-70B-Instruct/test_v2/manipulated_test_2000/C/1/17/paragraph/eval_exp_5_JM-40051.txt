After carefully reading the story, I have identified several issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Here are the issues I found:

* The text is a collection of unrelated passages, which makes it difficult to follow and understand the overall narrative [STRUCTURE].
* The writing style is often verbose and uses complex sentence structures, which can make it hard to comprehend [SYNTAX].
* There are abrupt shifts in topic and tone, such as the sudden introduction of characters like Jasper, Rosa, and George Stransom, which disrupt the flow of the text [TRANSITION].
* The text includes unrelated descriptions of people and places, such as the description of Mrs. Umney and Canterville Chase, which seem to be from a different story [STRUCTURE].
* The author's use of language is sometimes unclear or ambiguous, such as the phrase "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,'" which is unclear in its meaning [CLARITY].
* The text includes grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes [GRAMMAR].
* The author's argument about the location of the Garden of Eden is not well-supported and seems to be based on vague interpretations of biblical text [LOGIC].
* The text lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought [STRUCTURE].
* The use of poetic language and metaphors, such as "the bloom is off the plum" and "a glaze comes over his eyes," is often unclear and disrupts the flow of the text [LEXICON].

Given these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 2

The text lacks coherence due to its disjointed structure, abrupt shifts in topic and tone, and unclear language. The fluency of the text is also poor due to its complex sentence structures, verbose writing style, and grammatical errors. Overall, the text is difficult to follow and understand, and requires significant revision to improve its clarity and organization.
