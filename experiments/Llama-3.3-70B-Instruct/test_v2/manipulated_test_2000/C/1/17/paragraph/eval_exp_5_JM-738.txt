The given text is a literary analysis of Charles Dickens's last plot, specifically focusing on the novel "Edwin Drood". The text is written in a formal and academic tone, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary.

Issues affecting the ratings:

* [GRAMMAR] The text contains some long and convoluted sentences, which can make it difficult to follow. For example, the sentence "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises, and emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character" is quite long and contains multiple clauses.
* [SYNTAX] The text sometimes uses complex sentence structures, such as the use of multiple subordinate clauses, which can make it hard to understand. For instance, the sentence "If he has been dealing in opium for ten years (the exact period is not stated), he has been very disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasperâ€™s birth" contains a subordinate clause within a subordinate clause.
* [LEXICON] The text uses some archaic vocabulary, such as "demned" and "hab nab at a venture", which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
* [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Dickens's life and works, which may not be familiar to all readers. For example, the text mentions "the auld mysterie" without explaining what it refers to.
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different topics, such as the discussion of Dickens's writing style and the analysis of the characters in "Edwin Drood". This can make it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain ambiguous phrasing, which can make it hard to understand the author's intended meaning. For example, the sentence "The tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap" is somewhat unclear.
* [TRANSITION] The text sometimes lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs or sections, which can make it feel disjointed. For instance, the transition from the discussion of Dickens's writing style to the analysis of "Edwin Drood" feels somewhat abrupt.

Despite these issues, the text is generally well-written and engaging, with a clear passion for the subject matter.
