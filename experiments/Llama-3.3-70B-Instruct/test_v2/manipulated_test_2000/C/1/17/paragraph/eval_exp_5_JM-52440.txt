After carefully reading the given text, several issues affecting its fluency and coherence have been identified:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text appears to be a collection of unrelated passages from different stories or essays, which disrupts the overall coherence and flow of the narrative. The abrupt shifts between different topics and styles are jarring.
2. **[TRANSITION]** There are no clear transitions between the different sections of the text, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. The text jumps abruptly from a discussion of the Church of England to a story about a ghost, and then to a character's inner monologue.
3. **[CLARITY]** Some sentences are wordy or convoluted, which can make them hard to understand. For example, the sentence "That the most precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and that the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone" could be simplified for better clarity.
4. **[LEXICON]** The text employs a range of vocabulary, but some words or phrases may be unfamiliar to modern readers, which could affect fluency. For instance, terms like "sacramental appointment" or "consecrated elements" might require explanation for non-expert readers.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** There are no major grammatical errors, but some sentences are long and complex, which can make them hard to follow. For example, the sentence "That dear old Church is at this present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the most earnest prayers of all those who love the truth" could be broken up for easier reading.
6. **[LOGIC]** The text assumes a significant amount of background knowledge, particularly regarding theological concepts and historical context. Without this knowledge, some readers may find it challenging to follow the author's arguments or understand the relevance of certain points.

Given these issues, the final scores are:

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3

The low coherence score reflects the disjointed nature of the text, with its abrupt shifts in topic and style. The fluency score is somewhat higher, as the individual sentences are generally well-constructed, but the text's overall readability is still affected by its complexity, vocabulary, and lack of clear transitions.
