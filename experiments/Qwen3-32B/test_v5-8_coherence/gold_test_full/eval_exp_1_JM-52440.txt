1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall argument without significant effort.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally logical but suffers from excessive repetition and a lack of clear transitions between sections.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly complex and filled with theological jargon, which may obscure the main points for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt, especially when shifting between theological concepts, historical context, and doctrinal analysis.  
- [ORGANIZATION] While the text is organized into chapters and sections, the flow of ideas is sometimes disjointed, and the argument could benefit from a clearer roadmap or summary.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
