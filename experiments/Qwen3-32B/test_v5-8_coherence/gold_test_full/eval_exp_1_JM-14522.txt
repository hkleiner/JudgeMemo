1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a multi-chapter narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but the transition between chapters is abrupt and lacks connecting sentences that would help maintain a smooth narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative is generally logical and consistent, but some parts are confusing, such as the sudden reappearance of the bloodstain despite the family's efforts to remove it, which could have been better explained to maintain logical consistency.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain archaic language (e.g., "I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase," "I have no wish," etc.), which may reduce clarity for modern readers.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between scenes and chapters are weak, making it difficult to follow the progression of events and character development.  
- [CHARACTERIZATION] While the main characters are well-defined, the sudden shift in the ghost's personality and the resolution involving Virginia are not clearly foreshadowed, making the ending feel somewhat abrupt and disconnected from earlier parts of the story.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
