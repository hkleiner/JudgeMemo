1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text presents a series of disconnected geographical descriptions and claims without a clear logical progression or structure. The author jumps between topics such as geological features, religious interpretations, and historical references without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organization. It begins with a claim about the Garden of Eden's location, then shifts to descriptions of local geography, then back to theological arguments, making it difficult to follow the author's main argument.  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses vague or overly elaborate language, making it hard to discern the central message or key points. Phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" or "the finger of time" are unclear and do not contribute to the argument.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between paragraphs or sections. The text moves abruptly from one topic to another without linking ideas, which disrupts the flow and makes the overall argument hard to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The author makes numerous unsupported claims and assumptions, such as the assertion that the Garden of Eden is in the Mississippi River Valley, without providing sufficient evidence or logical reasoning to support these claims.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text includes multiple digressions and tangents, such as the discussion of rattlesnakes, the history of Trempealeau, and the author's personal experiences, which do not contribute to the central thesis and further fragment the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The author repeatedly asserts that the Garden of Eden is in this specific location, but does not consistently connect the described features to the biblical description of Eden in a way that is persuasive or logically sound.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
