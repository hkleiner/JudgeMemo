1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and complex, making it difficult to follow the overall structure and how different parts connect.
- [LOGIC] There are many plot developments and character interactions that are not clearly explained or logically connected, especially in the analysis of theories about the mystery.
- [CLARITY] The text often uses complex sentences and dense descriptions that reduce clarity and make it hard to follow the main ideas.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt or missing, making the flow of ideas difficult to track.
- [ORGANIZATION] The organization of information is sometimes confusing, particularly in the theories section where multiple interpretations are presented without clear distinction.
- [COHESION] The text lacks cohesive devices that would help connect ideas across the long narrative and analysis.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
