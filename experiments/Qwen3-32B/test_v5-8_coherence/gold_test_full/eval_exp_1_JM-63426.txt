1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and lacks clear paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections are minimal or absent, leading to abrupt shifts in time, location, and subject matter.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and wordy, reducing clarity and making it hard to grasp the main points.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes jumps between events without sufficient context or explanation, creating logical gaps.  
- [PUNCTUATION] The lack of proper punctuation in some sentences (e.g., run-on sentences, missing commas) hinders readability.  
- [STYLE] The text uses a mix of first-person and third-person narration without clear justification, which can be confusing.  
- [ORGANIZATION] The overall structure is disjointed, with little clear progression from one idea to the next.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
