1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into two distinct chapters, but the transition between them is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative or thematic connection.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences lack logical progression, especially in the second chapter, where the story of Will Bradley’s early life jumps between events with minimal explanation or chronological clarity.  
- [CLARITY] Certain phrases are confusing or ambiguous, such as “the bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'” This significantly hinders comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the narrative of Bradley’s early life is disjointed, making it difficult to follow the shift in tone and content.  
- [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors, including fragmented sentences and incorrect word order, which disrupt the flow and coherence of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
