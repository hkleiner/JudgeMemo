1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract theological concepts and specific doctrinal definitions without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient context or explanation, such as the sudden shift from discussing the nature of sacraments to the Church of England’s historical position.  
- [CLARITY] Several sentences are overly complex and lack clarity, such as: “That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.” This sentence is incoherent and difficult to parse.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the sacraments is weakened by the lack of a clear thesis or roadmap, making it challenging to determine the author’s ultimate point.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the first chapter is abrupt and lacks a smooth progression of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] The author uses theological jargon without defining key terms (e.g., “Real Presence,” “communion of the blood of Christ”), which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
