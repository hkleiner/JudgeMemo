1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a well-known literary work with a clear narrative structure, but the formatting of the text is inconsistent and fragmented in places, especially in the middle of dialogues and descriptions.  
- [LOGIC] There are no major logical inconsistencies in the narrative itself, but the formatting issues (e.g., line breaks and spacing) make the flow of the story harder to follow.  
- [CLARITY] Some lines are poorly formatted or broken in a way that affects readability (e.g., "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can").  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and scenes are generally smooth, but the formatting issues disrupt the natural flow of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter labeled "CHAPTER: nothing" appears out of place and introduces an abrupt break in the narrative flow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
