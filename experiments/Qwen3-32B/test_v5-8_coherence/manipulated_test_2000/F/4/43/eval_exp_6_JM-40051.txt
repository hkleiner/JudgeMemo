1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization; ideas are introduced and developed in a disjointed manner, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.  
- [LOGIC] There are numerous logical inconsistencies and unsupported claims, such as the assertion that the Garden of Eden is located in the Mississippi River valley, without sufficient evidence or reasoning.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or missing, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing, with vague or overly poetic descriptions that do not clearly support the central thesis.  
- [SPELLING] There are multiple spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "jageed") that hinder readability.  
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, including run-on sentences, fragments, and incorrect verb forms, which disrupt the flow and understanding.  
- [SYNTAX] Sentence structure is frequently awkward or overly complex, making it difficult to parse the intended meaning.  
- [REPETITION] Ideas are often repeated without adding new information, which reduces the overall coherence and effectiveness of the argument.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
