1) Coherence Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "am the true expositors", "was the real point at issue", "was not the present question").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense and form (e.g., "to had been settle", "to was directed", "we was taught", "we was not making").  
- [GRAMMAR] Improper use of "was" instead of "are" or "is" in multiple places.  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "to was" instead of "to be" or "to be".  
- [GRAMMAR] Use of incorrect prepositions or phrasal verbs (e.g., "to was the sons of God", "to was confounded", "to was directed").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "bless" instead of "blessed", "wased" instead of "was said", "conversed" instead of "conversed").  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are logically disconnected or unclear in their flow, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [CLARITY] Repetition and wordiness in some sections hinder clarity and make the text feel redundant.  
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and dense, which could make the logical structure harder to follow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
