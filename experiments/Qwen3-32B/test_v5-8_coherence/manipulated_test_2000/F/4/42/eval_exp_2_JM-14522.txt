1) Coherence Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "every one tell him," "they come to discuss terms," "the ghost has am see").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense usage (e.g., "it may had resisted," "the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended," "the blood-stain has been much admire").  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of modal verbs and auxiliary verbs (e.g., "we'dded have it," "It must was removed," "It was the blood of Lady Eleanore... who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband... in 1575").  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors (e.g., "woedn't," "have telegraphed for a waggonette," "he have fallen upon his knees").  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and confusing shifts in narrative focus (e.g., the transition from the Otis family's introduction to the ghost's appearance is abrupt and lacks smooth progression).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear sentence structures (e.g., "His guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much admire by tourists and others, and cannot be removed").  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent paragraph flow, especially in the transition between Chapter I and II.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak or missing transitions between ideas and paragraphs, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
