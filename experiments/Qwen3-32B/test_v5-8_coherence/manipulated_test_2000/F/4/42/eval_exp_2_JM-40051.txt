1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between speculative claims and descriptive details without a clear logical progression, making it hard to follow the author's reasoning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The organization is fragmented, with abrupt shifts in focus and no clear introduction, body, or conclusion.  
- [CLARITY] Many statements are vague or overly wordy, such as "Our garden is again right," which lacks specificity and clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader between ideas or sections.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for the Mississippi River Valley as the Garden of Eden is based on weak analogies and unsupported assumptions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text repeats ideas without building on them, such as the repeated emphasis on the "hanging garden" without resolving its significance.  
- [LOGIC] The text conflates religious interpretations with geographical descriptions without distinguishing between fact and speculation.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are confusing due to ambiguous pronouns and unclear antecedents, e.g., "he simply stated the principal facts" â€“ who is "he"?  
- [LOGIC] The author makes claims without addressing counterarguments or acknowledging the speculative nature of the claims.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a consistent flow, with ideas introduced and then abandoned, such as the discussion of Dr. Warren and the North Pole.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
