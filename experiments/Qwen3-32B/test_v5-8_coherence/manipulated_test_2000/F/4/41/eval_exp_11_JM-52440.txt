- [SYNTAX] Awkward and incomplete sentence structures (e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapternof St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lordâ€™s Supper").  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition and lack of clear paragraphing in some sections, making the flow of ideas less direct.  
- [TRANSITION] Some abrupt transitions between ideas, particularly between the introduction and the first chapter, and between theological arguments and references to Church documents.
