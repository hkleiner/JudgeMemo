1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts between different narrative fragments and a formal theological discourse without clear transitions or logical progression.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of unrelated narrative passages (e.g., the ghost story, the character George Stransom) disrupts the coherence of the theological argument.  
- [CLARITY] The introduction and conclusion of narrative elements are unclear, leaving the reader confused about the relationship between the different parts.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between the theological content and the fictional narrative segments, making the text feel disjointed.  
- [CONTEXT] The reader is left without sufficient context to understand the purpose or connection between the various sections, especially the abrupt switch from theological discussion to unrelated fictional scenes.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
