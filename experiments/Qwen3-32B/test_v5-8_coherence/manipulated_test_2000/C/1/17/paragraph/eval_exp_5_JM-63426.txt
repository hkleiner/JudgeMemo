1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from a biographical introduction of Will Bradley to a seemingly unrelated narrative involving characters named Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston, creating confusion about the main subject and purpose.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Stransom and the jeweller’s shop appears to be a fictional vignette that is not clearly connected to the rest of the text, making it difficult to understand its relevance to the overall discussion of Will Bradley.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the introduction of Will Bradley, the unrelated narrative, and the subsequent chapter about his early life, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains vague references and unclear connections (e.g., “He closes here with chuckling praises of the fine, free-handed job they are doing”) that make it hard to follow the author’s intent.  
- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," reads like a fictionalized biography or story, but it is not clearly differentiated from the earlier sections, causing confusion about the text’s genre and focus.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Sir Simon" and the mysterious disappearance is another unexplained segment that appears to be unrelated to the rest of the text, further contributing to the lack of coherence.  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph in the first chapter ("Now his retirement has lasted almost as long as his active career...") is disconnected from the preceding narrative and abruptly shifts to a conclusion that lacks context.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: [2.5]
