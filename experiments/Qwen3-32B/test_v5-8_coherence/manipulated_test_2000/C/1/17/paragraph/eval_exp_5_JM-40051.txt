1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a jumbled collection of different narratives and ideas with no clear organization or logical flow. It shifts abruptly from a supposed discovery of the Garden of Eden to a romantic plot involving Jasper and Rosa, then to a description of a house in Canterville Chase, and finally to a business office scene.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the discovery of the Garden of Eden and the romantic plot is entirely unclear and seems unrelated. The text lacks a unifying theme or purpose.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the different narrative segments. The shifts are abrupt and disorienting, making it difficult to follow the author's intent.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often confusing and lacks clarity. For example, the romantic plot involving Jasper and Rosa is introduced without context or explanation, and the connection to the Garden of Eden is never established.  
- [CONTEXT] The text appears to be a compilation of fragments from different sources (e.g., a supposed discovery of Eden, a Gothic romance, and a business narrative), none of which are properly introduced or connected.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 1.5
