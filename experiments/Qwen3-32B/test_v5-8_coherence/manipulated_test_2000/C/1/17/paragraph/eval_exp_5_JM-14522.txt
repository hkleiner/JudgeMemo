1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains multiple narrative shifts without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow which part of the story is being told.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a ghost story to a philosophical reflection on Christmas and back again, without logical connection or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain unnecessary digressions, making the main narrative harder to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] There is no clear transition between the introduction of the Otis family and the ghost's first appearance, leading to confusion about the story's flow.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Dickens and Edwin Drood is out of context and does not logically connect to the rest of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
