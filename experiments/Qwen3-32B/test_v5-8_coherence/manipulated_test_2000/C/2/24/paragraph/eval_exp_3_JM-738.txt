1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from literary analysis to narrative summary without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall purpose.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences appear disconnected from the main argument, such as the unrelated line “A cloud upload completed” and “A livestream began recording,” which disrupt the flow and logic.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally lacks clarity in its explanations, especially in the transition between Dickens’s health and the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the "Story" chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear signpost or summary to prepare the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of unrelated characters like Sapsea and Durdles is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the reader confused and disrupting the logical progression.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
