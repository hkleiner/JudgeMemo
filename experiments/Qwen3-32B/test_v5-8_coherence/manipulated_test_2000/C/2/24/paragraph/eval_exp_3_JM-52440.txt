1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text includes two seemingly unrelated and out-of-context sentences ("The voice recognition module powered up." and "The biosensor updated its readout.") that disrupt the logical flow and thematic unity of the passage.  
- [LOGIC] The overall argument is complex and detailed, but the lack of clear paragraph transitions and subheadings makes it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas at times.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are verbose or repetitive, which can obscure the clarity of the argument (e.g., repeated emphasis on the distinction between sign and thing signified).  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between major sections (e.g., from the introduction to the analysis of the Articles) are abrupt and could benefit from smoother signposting.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The tone and style are consistent throughout, which supports coherence, but the content could be better organized to maintain reader engagement and clarity.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
