1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of a hologram and a bluetooth signal without context or relevance to the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent tone when a surveillance camera is mentioned, which disrupts the historical and gothic setting.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts between detailed character descriptions and sudden, unexplained technological intrusions.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "phantasmata" and "sanguineous stains" is overly academic and out of place in a narrative tone.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs in Chapter II, particularly when moving from the familyâ€™s dinner conversation to Mr. Otis encountering the ghost.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
