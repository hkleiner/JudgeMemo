1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Will Bradley's artistic impact to a detailed and unrelated narrative about his childhood without clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions or contextual cues.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, such as “The home assistant played ambient music” and “The energy grid remained balanced,” which appear disconnected from the main narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the second chapter is abrupt and lacks a logical link or summary to prepare the reader for the shift in tone and content.  
- [LOGIC] The text introduces a "livestream began recording" and a "kerosene flare" without explanation or relevance to the broader narrative, creating confusion.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
