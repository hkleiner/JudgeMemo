1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure; ideas jump between different topics and descriptions without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient evidence or logical progression, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning is often unclear due to vague or overly poetic language, such as "the thing" or "a stuff," which hinder understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between ideas and descriptions, with little to no transitional phrases or sentences.  
- [SPELLING] There are multiple spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "jageed") that disrupt the flow and clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains grammatical errors and sentence fragments that make it harder to follow the author's message.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
