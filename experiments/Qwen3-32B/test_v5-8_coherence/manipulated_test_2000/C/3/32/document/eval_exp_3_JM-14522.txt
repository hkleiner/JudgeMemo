1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally shifts between descriptive passages and dialogue without clear transitions, which can confuse the reader.  
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the dialogue and narrative contain abrupt or illogical shifts in tone or subject, such as the American Minister's casual dismissal of the supernatural, which contrasts sharply with the eerie atmosphere of the setting.  
- [CLARITY] There are instances of unclear references or vague phrases, such as "the thing" or "a stuff," which are used in place of proper names or terms, making the text confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs transition abruptly from one scene or idea to another without sufficient context or explanation, such as the sudden appearance of the ghost in Chapter II without prior buildup.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The character of Mr. Otis remains overly dismissive and pragmatic throughout, which is consistent, but the tone of the story shifts between serious and humorous without clear justification, affecting the overall coherence.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
