1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narrative styles and timeframes without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences and paragraphs lack logical connections, especially in the second chapter, where the narrative of Will Bradley’s early life is presented in a disjointed, episodic manner.  
- [CLARITY] The use of vague or ambiguous phrases such as “a thing,” “the stuff,” and “back a stuff” disrupts the reader’s ability to follow the narrative and understand the context.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the introduction and the second chapter, and within the second chapter, the shift between childhood memories and historical commentary is abrupt.  
- [COHESION] The overall cohesion of the text is weakened by inconsistent tone and register, shifting between formal commentary and a more casual, almost fictionalized narrative.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
