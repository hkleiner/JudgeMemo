1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics and contexts without clear transitions (e.g., from theological discussions to unrelated literary analysis of characters like Jasper or Lady Eleanore).  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies and abrupt shifts in argument, such as introducing unrelated examples or anecdotes that do not support the main argument.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, especially in theological discussions, which can obscure the central message.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or paragraphs between major sections or ideas, making the flow of the text disjointed.  
- [CONTEXT] Certain paragraphs appear out of place or unrelated to the main subject, such as the description of Millet's painting or the anecdote about EXCALIBUR.  
- [FOCUS] The text frequently deviates from its primary focus on the Church of England's doctrine to include tangential or unrelated content.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
