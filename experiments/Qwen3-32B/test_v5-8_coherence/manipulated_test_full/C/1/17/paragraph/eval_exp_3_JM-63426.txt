1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear overall structure and logical progression between sections. It jumps between different periods of Will Bradley's life without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sections appear disconnected from the main narrative about Will Bradley. For example, the section about Millet and the passage about "the verger" and "Prince Hedward" seem out of place and unrelated to the main subject.  
- [LOGIC] There are several non-sequitur passages that appear to be excerpts from other texts or books, such as the passage about "Hill's Hypochondriasis" and the religious prayer text.  
- [LOGIC] Some historical references appear without context, making it difficult to understand their relevance to Will Bradley's story.  
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes shifts between first-person and third-person narration without explanation, confusing the reader about whose perspective they're reading.  
- [TRANSITION] The text abruptly shifts between different time periods and topics without transitional phrases or sentences.  
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs appear to be unrelated excerpts from other works, such as the passage about "Anthony Hope’s Prisoner of Zenda" and the passage about "Dr. Warren demolishes Engel’s attempt."  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
