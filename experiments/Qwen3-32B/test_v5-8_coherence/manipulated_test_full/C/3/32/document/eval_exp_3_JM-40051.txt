1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization. It jumps between different topics and descriptions without a coherent flow.  
- [LOGIC] There are numerous logical inconsistencies and unsupported claims, such as the assertion that the described location is the Garden of Eden without clear evidence or reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and confusing, with vague references and ambiguous statements. For example, it frequently uses phrases like "a stuff" and "the thing" instead of specific names.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the author's line of thought.  
- [RELEVANCE] Some sections are irrelevant to the main topic, such as detailed descriptions of local geography and settlements that do not contribute to the argument about the Garden of Eden.  
- [REPETITION] The text is repetitive, with many ideas and descriptions repeated without adding new information.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
