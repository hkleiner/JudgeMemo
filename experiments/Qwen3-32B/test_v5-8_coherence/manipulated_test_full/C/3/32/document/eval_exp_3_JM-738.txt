1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a complex literary analysis with multiple nested plot summaries and theories, but lacks clear sectioning or paragraph transitions that would help the reader follow the flow of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to discern the main point or logical progression. For example: "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before."  
- [LOGIC] The argumentation is sometimes disjointed, with sudden shifts between analyzing the novel, presenting theories, and discussing illustrations or historical context. There is little explicit connection between these elements.  
- [TRANSITION] The text frequently moves between discussing the novel itself, theories about its ending, and commentary on previous critics, but these transitions are abrupt and often lack connecting phrases or sentences.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains numerous nested narratives (the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," theories about its ending, analysis of illustrations, and commentary on previous critics) that are not clearly demarcated or explained.  
- [CLARITY] The use of placeholder words like "a stuff" and "the thing" throughout the text is confusing and undermines readability. These appear to be errors or placeholders that were not corrected.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a chapter format but lacks clear headings or subheadings to guide the reader through the complex analysis.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments rely on assumptions about Dickens's intentions that are not clearly supported by evidence from the text.  
- [CLARITY] The frequent use of archaic or obscure language (e.g., "demned," "stuff and Heywood," "auld mysterie") without explanation can be confusing to modern readers.  
- [STRUCTURE] The conclusion section attempts to tie together all the previous analysis but does so in a way that feels rushed and disconnected from the earlier parts of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
