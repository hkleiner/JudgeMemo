1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure. It jumps between different topics (Real Presence, Adoration, Sacrifice) without clear transitions or organization.  
- [LOGIC] The argumentation is often circular or repetitive. The author frequently reiterates the same points without building a coherent logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The text is overly complex and verbose, making it difficult to follow the main argument. Key terms are not consistently defined, and the meaning is often obscured by archaic or convoluted language.  
- [TRANSITION] There are minimal or no transitional phrases between paragraphs and sections, which makes it hard to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [COHERENCE] The overall message is muddled. The author attempts to clarify the Church of England's doctrine but fails to present a unified and clear position due to inconsistent references and ambiguous claims.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
