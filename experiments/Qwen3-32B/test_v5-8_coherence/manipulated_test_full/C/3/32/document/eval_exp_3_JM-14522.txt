1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a consistent narrative structure as a ghost story, but the frequent use of the word "the stuff" in place of proper nouns creates confusion and disrupts the flow.  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the narrative caused by the repeated use of "the stuff" instead of specific names, making it difficult to follow character identities and relationships.  
- [CLARITY] The text is generally clear in its storytelling, but the substitution of "the stuff" for proper nouns significantly reduces clarity and makes the narrative confusing in many parts.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and chapters are generally smooth, but the repetition of "the stuff" disrupts the natural flow of the narrative.  
- [LEXICON] The use of "the stuff" as a placeholder for specific names creates a lexical issue, as it prevents the reader from fully understanding the context and relationships between characters.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
