1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, detailed literary analysis that jumps between multiple plot points, theories, and character relationships without clear transitions or organization. The structure is dense and lacks a logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text presents multiple conflicting theories about the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* without clearly distinguishing between them or explaining their relationships to the main narrative. This creates confusion about the central argument.  
- [CLARITY] The writing is overly complex, with long, convoluted sentences that make it difficult to follow the author's reasoning. The dense academic style and lack of clear signposting reduce readability.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between sections (e.g., from plot summary to analysis of theories) without adequate transitions to guide the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The text presents speculative theories (e.g., about the identity of Datchery) as if they are definitive conclusions, which creates inconsistency in the argument.  
- [LOGIC] The author frequently introduces new ideas or theories without clearly connecting them to the previous content, making it hard to track the overall argument.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
