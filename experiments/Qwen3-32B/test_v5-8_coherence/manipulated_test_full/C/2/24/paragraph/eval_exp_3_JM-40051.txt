1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization, with abrupt shifts between different topics and descriptions.  
- [LOGIC] There are numerous logical inconsistencies and unsupported claims, such as equating the Mississippi River with the Euphrates and claiming this area is the Garden of Eden without sufficient evidence.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is often unclear and unfocused, with the author jumping from one descriptive detail to another without a clear thread.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs are weak or nonexistent, making it difficult to follow the author's line of reasoning.  
- [RELEVANCE] Some sections are highly tangential, such as the detailed descriptions of local geography and settlements, which do not directly support the main argument.  
- [REPETITION] The author repeats the same claims and phrases multiple times without adding new information or evidence.  
- [CONTEXT] The text assumes the reader has prior knowledge of specific local landmarks and historical events, which may not be widely known, reducing overall coherence for a general audience.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
