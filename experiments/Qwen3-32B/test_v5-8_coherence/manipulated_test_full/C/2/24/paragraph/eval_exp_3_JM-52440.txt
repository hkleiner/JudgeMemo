1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression without effort.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain multiple clauses, reducing readability and clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] While the overall structure is logical, some transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt or unclear.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is logically sound and well-structured, but the length and density make it challenging to maintain coherence throughout for the reader.  
- [REPETITION] Certain ideas are repeated multiple times, which can cause redundancy and disrupt the flow of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
