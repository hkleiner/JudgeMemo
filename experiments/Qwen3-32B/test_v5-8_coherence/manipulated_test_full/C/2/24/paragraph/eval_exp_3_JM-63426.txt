1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a biography of Will Bradley, but the narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow a linear progression.  
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs introduce new ideas or details without sufficient context or connection to the previous content, creating confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains complex sentences and dense descriptions that occasionally obscure the main narrative, especially in the more detailed historical and technical sections.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader between different sections or chapters, leading to abrupt shifts in focus.  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text switches between first-person and third-person narration, and between past and present tense, without clear indication, which can disorient the reader.  
- [ORGANIZATION] The chronological structure is generally sound, but the inclusion of technical details, historical context, and personal anecdotes is uneven and sometimes jarring.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
