1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text contains modern technological references (e.g., "deepfake filter," "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator," "AI core," "self-driving cart") that are anachronistic and disrupt the 19th-century Gothic setting.  
- [STRUCTURE] Some narrative transitions are abrupt, especially between the ghost's internal monologues and external actions, which can confuse the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally includes unnecessary or overly elaborate descriptions that do not contribute to the plot or character development (e.g., detailed descriptions of the ghost's wardrobe choices).  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's sudden transformation into a "white dimity bed-curtain" is confusing and lacks a clear explanation, making it harder for the reader to follow the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of modern devices like a "self-driving cart" and "wireless charger" creates a jarring disconnect with the historical and supernatural tone of the story.  
- [LOGIC] The final scene where Virginia refuses to explain what happened with the ghost is slightly abrupt and lacks a clear narrative buildup to justify the secrecy.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
