1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is generally well-organized, but there are occasional abrupt shifts in focus that disrupt the flow, particularly in the middle chapters where the ghost's attempts to scare the family become repetitive and less connected.  
- [LOGIC] Some events and character reactions are not clearly motivated, such as the sudden transformation of the ghost's plan in Chapter III, which feels somewhat disconnected from the previous attempts.  
- [CLARITY] There are a few confusing or ambiguous sentences, especially in the more elaborate descriptions of the ghost's past exploits, which could benefit from clearer transitions or explanations.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between some paragraphs are weak or missing, particularly in the longer descriptions of the ghost's history and the Otis family's responses, which could lead to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The final resolution involving Virginia and the ghost is somewhat abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup or explanation, making the emotional impact feel slightly rushed.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
