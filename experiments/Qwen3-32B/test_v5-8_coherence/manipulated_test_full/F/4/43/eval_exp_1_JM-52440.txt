1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure and progression of ideas. The logical flow is obscured by the sheer volume of content and lack of clear sectioning.  
- [CLARITY] The language is often archaic and complex, which hinders clarity. For example, phrases like "He is unworthy of the Lord that otherwise doth celebrate that mystery than it was delivered by Him" are difficult to understand without additional context.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments lack clear logical connections. The author frequently makes assertions without providing sufficient explanation or transition to the next point, making it hard to see how one idea leads to another.  
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks effective transitions between paragraphs and sections, which makes it challenging to follow the author's reasoning and argument.  
- [RELEVANCE] There are sections that seem to digress from the main topic without returning to it, which disrupts the coherence of the overall text. For example, the author frequently refers to historical figures and events without clearly tying them back to the central argument.  
- [REPETITION] The author often repeats the same points in different ways without adding new information, which can confuse the reader and dilute the impact of the argument.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
