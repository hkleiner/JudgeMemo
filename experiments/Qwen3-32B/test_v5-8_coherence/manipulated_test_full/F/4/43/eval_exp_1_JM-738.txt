1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex and multi-layered structure with multiple chapters and sub-sections, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative flow and progression.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly verbose and contain dense, convoluted sentences that obscure the main points and reduce readability.  
- [LOGIC] The logical connections between some paragraphs are weak or missing, especially in the analysis of theories and character motivations.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between different sections and ideas are inconsistent, sometimes abrupt, which disrupts the flow of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The use of bullet points, incomplete sentences, and fragmented text (especially in the "DATCHERY'S SCORE" and "A QUESTION OF TASTE" sections) disrupts the coherence and makes it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases and sentences are grammatically incorrect or awkwardly phrased, which hinders understanding (e.g., "Consequence in, ring Walters Durdles madefound as, the be Cuming").  
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents contradictory or conflicting interpretations of the same events or characters without clear resolution, creating confusion for the reader.  
- [STRUCTURE] The frequent shifts between narrative and analysis, and between different theories and interpretations, create a disjointed reading experience.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
