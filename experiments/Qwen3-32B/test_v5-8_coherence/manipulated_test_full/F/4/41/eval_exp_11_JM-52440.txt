1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure and progression of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] There are abrupt shifts in focus between theological arguments, historical references, and polemical attacks on opposing views, which disrupt the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, reducing readability and making it hard to grasp the intended meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often weak or absent, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [REPETITION] Certain points are repeated multiple times, which can confuse the reader and suggest a lack of organization.  
- [LEXICON] There are several misspellings and typographical errors (e.g., "Doctrune," "Taughtvby," "vlindly," "experiejced," "het," "Docteine") that interfere with comprehension.  
- [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors (e.g., "ans place," "but they, and they only," "he doth not receive the Sacrament with his mouth") that disrupt the flow and clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have poor syntax or are run-on, making it difficult to parse the intended meaning (e.g., "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with anybsuch representation of its teaching").  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
