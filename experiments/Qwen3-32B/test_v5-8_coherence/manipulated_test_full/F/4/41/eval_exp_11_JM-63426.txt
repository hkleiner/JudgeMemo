1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a biography of Will Bradley with a complex, non-linear structure that jumps between different periods of his life without clear transitions or chronological markers.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative often shifts abruptly between events, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of Bradley's career and personal life.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are written in second-person ("You are six years old..."), which is jarring and confusing when juxtaposed with third-person accounts of Bradley's life.  
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the many time jumps and thematic shifts in the text.  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text switches between first-person accounts by Bradley and third-person narration by an unknown author, creating inconsistency in voice and perspective.  
- [ORGANIZATION] The chronology is often unclear, with events presented out of order or with insufficient contextualization.  
- [READABILITY] The text contains numerous typographical errors and inconsistencies (e.g., "tovwhich" instead of "to which," "thebTwo Orphans" instead of "the Two Orphans") that disrupt the reading flow.  
- [COHESION] The text lacks a clear central thesis or organizing principle beyond simply presenting events in Bradley's life, making it feel more like a collection of anecdotes than a cohesive biography.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
