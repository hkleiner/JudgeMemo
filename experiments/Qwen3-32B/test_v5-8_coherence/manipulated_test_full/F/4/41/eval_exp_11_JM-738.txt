1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and complex, making it difficult to follow the logical flow and maintain coherence throughout.  
- [LOGIC] There are numerous abrupt shifts in focus and unclear transitions between ideas, especially between the introduction, analysis of characters, and theories about the plot.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are convoluted and filled with overly complex vocabulary and archaic phrasing, which hinders comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the story section is abrupt and lacks clear signposting, making it hard to follow the narrative structure.  
- [LOGIC] The theories presented are often contradictory and lack a clear progression, making it difficult to determine the author's central argument or conclusion.  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses complex sentence structures and archaic language that obscure meaning and make the text less accessible.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organization of ideas, with multiple theories and interpretations presented in a disjointed manner.  
- [LOGIC] The author presents multiple conflicting interpretations of the plot without clearly distinguishing between them or providing a coherent framework for evaluating their validity.
