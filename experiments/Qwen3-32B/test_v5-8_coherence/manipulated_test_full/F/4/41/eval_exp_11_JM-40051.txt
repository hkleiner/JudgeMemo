1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure. It jumps between descriptions of the landscape, biblical references, and speculative claims without a coherent flow or organization.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for the Garden of Eden being located in Wisconsin is based on weak or speculative connections between biblical descriptions and the landscape, often without clear reasoning or evidence.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear due to vague or overly elaborate descriptions, making it difficult to follow the author's main points.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas, leading to abrupt shifts and a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The author makes unsupported assertions (e.g., that the region is the true Garden of Eden) without addressing counterarguments or alternative explanations.  
- [CLARITY] The writing is repetitive and circular, with the same points being restated in different ways without adding new information.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, making it difficult to discern the author's purpose or main argument.  
- [LOGIC] The author uses emotional or poetic language (e.g., "Come and see!") rather than logical or factual reasoning to support the claims.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors that obscure meaning and reduce readability.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
