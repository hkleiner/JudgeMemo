1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a complex narrative with multiple characters and plot developments, but the overall structure is well-organized with clear chapter divisions that follow a logical sequence.  
- [LOGIC] The plot follows a clear cause-and-effect progression as the ghost attempts to scare the Otis family and is ultimately defeated by Virginia's compassion.  
- [TRANSITION] There are smooth transitions between chapters and narrative segments, with each chapter building naturally on the previous one.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative is generally clear and easy to follow, with well-defined characters and a consistent point of view.  
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate for the narrative style and context, though some archaic or stylistic choices (like "THE CANTERVILLE GHOST" in all caps) are inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "biught" instead of "bought," "sne" instead of "she," "emiled" instead of "smiled," "witu" instead of "with," "mexum" instead of "maximum"), which disrupt the reading experience and affect coherence.  
- [PUNCTUATION] There are occasional punctuation errors and missing punctuation marks that could cause confusion (e.g., missing commas, quotation marks, and periods).  
- [GRAMMAR] There are some grammatical errors (e.g., "He had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and they started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovelynJuly evening" - missing space after "lovelyn"), which affect the clarity and flow of the text.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative maintains consistent character development and thematic elements throughout the story, contributing to overall coherence.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
