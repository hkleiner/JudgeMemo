1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, multi-chapter biography with a complex narrative structure that may be difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the subject.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters are minimal or non-existent, making the overall flow of the text disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, reducing readability and clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different periods and events in the subject's life without clear temporal or thematic connections.  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text shifts between first-person and third-person narration without clear indication, which can be confusing for readers.  
- [TENSE] The text inconsistently uses past and present tense, especially in the narrative sections, which can be disorienting.  
- [REPETITION] Some information is repeated across different chapters, which reduces the overall coherence of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
