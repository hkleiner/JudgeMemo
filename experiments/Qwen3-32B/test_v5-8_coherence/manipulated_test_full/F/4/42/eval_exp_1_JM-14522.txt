1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different timelines and perspectives without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events.  
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and lack clear organization, leading to confusion about the flow of the story.  
- [CLARITY] Certain sentences are ambiguous or lack sufficient context, such as the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghost without clear cause or effect.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between dialogue and description without smooth transitions, which disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some character actions are inconsistent or illogical, such as the American family's nonchalant reactions to supernatural events, which are not well-motivated or explained.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story's climax and resolution are somewhat rushed, with key developments (e.g., Virginia's interaction with the ghost) introduced abruptly without sufficient buildup or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of the prophecy and the symbolic elements (e.g., the almond tree) are not clearly explained, leaving readers to infer their significance.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
