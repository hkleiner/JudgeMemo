1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text is overly complex and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas. The arguments are often buried in long, convoluted sentences that hinder clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] While the text is divided into chapters and sections, the organization within each section is sometimes unclear. The flow between paragraphs is inconsistent, and transitions are often abrupt or missing.  
- [CLARITY] The language is archaic and overly formal, which can obscure meaning for modern readers. Some phrases are repetitive or redundant, adding unnecessary length without improving clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between ideas are weak or absent, especially between paragraphs and across chapters. This makes it difficult to follow how one idea leads to the next.  
- [REPETITION] Certain points are repeated multiple times without adding new information or perspective, which reduces the overall efficiency and coherence of the text.  
- [COHERENCE] The central argument—that the Church of England does not teach the doctrine of the Real Presence—is occasionally lost amid the detailed theological and historical discussion, making the main point harder to grasp.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
