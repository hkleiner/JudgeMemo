1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a complex literary analysis with multiple nested theories and interpretations, making it difficult to follow the main argument or conclusion.
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different theories (Proctor's, Walters', Forster's) without clear transitions or logical connections between them.
- [CLARITY] The text uses complex, archaic language and sentence structures that make comprehension challenging for modern readers.
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases to guide the reader through the complex argumentation and multiple perspectives presented.
- [COHERENCE] The text presents multiple contradictory interpretations of the same literary work without clearly distinguishing between them or resolving the contradictions.
- [FOCUS] The text shifts between discussing the plot of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," analyzing literary theories, and making biographical observations about Dickens without clear focus.
- [ORGANIZATION] The text lacks a clear organizational structure, making it difficult to track the author's argument or main points.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text presents multiple perspectives on the same events and characters without clearly indicating whose perspective is being presented at any given time.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
