1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into two distinct chapters with very different tones and content (a biographical introduction vs. a fictionalized childhood narrative), which may confuse readers expecting a unified narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from a reflective introduction to a fictionalized account of Bradleyâ€™s childhood is abrupt and lacks a clear transition or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences in the childhood narrative are overly detailed and repetitive (e.g., descriptions of meals and clothing), which can slow the narrative flow and reduce clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the two chapters is not smooth, making the overall structure feel disjointed.  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The shift from a third-person analytical tone in the introduction to a first-person, almost diary-like narrative in the second chapter is jarring and lacks contextual explanation.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
