1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a chapter excerpt from a larger narrative, making it difficult to assess full coherence without context from the rest of the story.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, especially when shifting between dialogue and narrative description.  
- [CLARITY] Certain phrases are overly verbose or complex, such as "the presentation of psychical phenomena," which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context or genre.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of detailed American cultural references (e.g., "Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt," "Boston in the development of the world-soul") is somewhat disjointed from the main narrative and feels forced.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's evening drive to the ghost's appearance at 1 o'clock is sudden and lacks a smooth narrative bridge.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
