1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense with theological content, but the structure is generally logical and follows a clear progression from introduction to analysis of the doctrine.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is logically presented, with a clear thesis and supporting points, though some sections are repetitive and could benefit from tighter transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The language is formal and archaic in places, which may hinder clarity for modern readers, but the ideas are generally expressed with precision.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt, especially when moving from one theological concept to another without clear signposting.  
- [COHERENCE] The overall coherence is strong, with the author maintaining a consistent focus on the central question of the Church of Englandâ€™s doctrine. However, the complexity of the subject matter and the length of the text make it slightly challenging to follow at times.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
