1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author’s reasoning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The organization is inconsistent, with paragraphs beginning and ending abruptly, and ideas presented out of order.  
- [CLARITY] The author uses vague or overly poetic language that obscures meaning, such as “the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the ‘North West,’ as the place.”  
- [LOGIC] The argument is repetitive and lacks a clear progression, often circling back to the same points without building on them.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between sections, making the flow of ideas disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The text makes speculative claims without sufficient evidence or logical support, such as equating the Mississippi with the Euphrates.  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses archaic or unclear phrasing, such as “the fabled dog, ‘they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality.’”  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
