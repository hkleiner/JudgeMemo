The story is a detailed biography of Will Bradley, an influential figure in American graphic design and typography. It is written in a narrative style, blending biographical facts with a reflective tone. Below is my evaluation of the text in terms of fluency and coherence, including specific issues identified.

---

### **Fluency Issues**

[SYNTAX] The text often uses complex sentence structures and long, winding sentences that can be difficult to follow. For example:  
> "During the Colonial period printers were restricted to Caslon in roman and italic, and an Old English Text. What gave me my love for Caslon and the Old English Text called Caslon Black I do not know."  
This sentence structure is awkward and could be simplified for better readability.

[GRAMMAR] There are a few grammatical issues, though they are relatively minor. For example:  
> "When the tide is at the lowest, ’tis but nearest to the turn."  
The use of the contraction "’tis" and the archaic phrasing may be stylistic, but it can be confusing for modern readers.

[LEXICON] The text contains some archaic or overly formal language that may feel out of place in a modern context. For example:  
> "He is an inveterate sportsman in a land where game, deer and fish, is plentiful."  
The use of "inveterate" and the archaic phrasing may not be as accessible to all readers.

[CLARITY] Some sentences are ambiguous or lack clear subject-verb agreement. For example:  
> "The script calls for slow music and heart-rending sobs--another Kate Claxton in the Two Orphans."  
It is unclear who or what "the script" refers to, and the reference to "Kate Claxton" is obscure without context.

### **Coherence Issues**

[STRUCTURE] The text is structured into multiple chapters, which is generally effective. However, the transitions between chapters and sections are sometimes abrupt. For example, the shift from the introduction to the chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" is sudden and lacks a clear narrative link.

[LOGIC] There are occasional logical gaps or unclear connections between ideas. For example:  
> "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget."  
It is not clear what advice is being referred to, and the impact of this advice is not elaborated.

[TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin without clear transitions from the previous content. For example:  
> "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid."  
This sentence appears without a clear connection to the preceding paragraph, making the flow less smooth.

[ORGANIZATION] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without always providing clear context. For example, the narrative shifts from Bradley's childhood to his later career in Chicago with little transitional explanation.
