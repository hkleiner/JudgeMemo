**Issues Identified in the Text:**

- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms are used throughout the text (e.g., "am the true expositors," "was the real point at issue," "there was no authoritative documents," "I was not now making any assertion"). This affects fluency and readability.

- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors are present (e.g., "those who was loyal," "the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt").

- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of tenses (e.g., "the point was supposed to had been settle," "the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt").

- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of prepositions and sentence structure (e.g., "to was directed," "to was the sons of God," "to was a sign").

- [GRAMMAR] Missing or incorrect articles (e.g., "the 6th chapter of St. John," "the most precious body and blood of our most bless Saviour").

- [GRAMMAR] Misused or missing punctuation (e.g., missing commas in complex sentences, missing apostrophes in contractions).

- [LEXICON] Redundancy and awkward phrasing (e.g., "blind consent is blindly give," "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced").

- [LOGIC] Some reasoning gaps are present (e.g., the author makes assertions about the Church of Englandâ€™s doctrine without clearly linking them to the cited documents).

- [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat logical, but the flow between paragraphs could be improved. Some paragraphs are long and dense, making it harder to follow the argument.

- [CLARITY] The text contains some vague or ambiguous phrasing, particularly in theological language (e.g., "the real objective presence," "spiritual food," "feeding by faith").

- [TRANSITION] Transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt or missing, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of the argument.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 3**  
The text presents a clear argument about the Church of England's doctrine of the Real Presence, and the ideas are generally well-organized. However, the coherence is somewhat hindered by poor transitions, some logical gaps, and the dense, theological nature of the content, which can obscure the flow of ideas.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  
The fluency is significantly impacted by numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb forms, and awkward phrasing. The text is difficult to read in places due to these issues, which disrupt the natural flow and readability.
