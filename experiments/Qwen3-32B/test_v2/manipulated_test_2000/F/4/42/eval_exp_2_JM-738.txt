#### **Coherence Issues**

- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between analysis and narrative without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall purpose or focus.
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear organizational flow. It begins with literary analysis, then moves into a character summary, and then into the plot, without clear sectioning or headings.
- [LOGIC] The introduction of characters and plot is sometimes disjointed and lacks a clear chronological or thematic order.
- [LOGIC] Some references (e.g., to "The Signalman" or Forster's biography) are introduced without sufficient context, making their relevance unclear.
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, especially when moving from one character to another or from analysis to plot summary.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or ambiguous, such as: "He see in his vision, ‘that,’ I never saw ‘that’ before." → should be "He **saw** in his vision..."
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the text is not clearly defined. It reads like a mix of critical essay, summary, and speculative analysis, without a clear thesis or goal.
- [STRUCTURE] The use of italics and quotation marks is inconsistent and sometimes distracting, without a clear pattern or purpose.
- [LOGIC] The mention of Mr. Cuming Walters and his theories appears abruptly and is not clearly tied to the overall analysis of the story.
