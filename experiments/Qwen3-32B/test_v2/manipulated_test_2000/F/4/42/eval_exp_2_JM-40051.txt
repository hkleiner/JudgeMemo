- [GRAMMAR] “The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark...” – run-on sentence and poor punctuation.
- [GRAMMAR] “which consitutes the islands and “river bottoms”—cut up by water courses and sloughs.” – misspelled word (“consitutes”).
- [GRAMMAR] “The second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark” – misspelled word (“hightest”).

These numerous grammatical errors significantly impact fluency by making the text difficult to read and understand.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The argument that the Garden of Eden is located in a specific region in the U.S. is presented without clear evidence or logical progression. The author jumps between biblical references and geographic claims without sufficient justification.
- [LOGIC] The comparison between the Mississippi and the Euphrates is made but not clearly supported with logical or historical evidence.
- [LOGIC] The claim that the Garden of Eden is in a specific valley is introduced abruptly, with no prior setup or explanation of why this location is the correct one.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized in a disjointed manner, with abrupt shifts between descriptions of the landscape, biblical references, and historical anecdotes.
- [STRUCTURE] Paragraphs are often long and unfocused, making it difficult to follow the author’s reasoning.
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between ideas or paragraphs. For example, the text moves from the author’s personal discovery to a description of the landscape to a historical anecdote about settlers, without connecting these elements smoothly.
- [CLARITY] Phrases like “the finger of time has am plainly pointing” and “the profuse growth of timber” are vague or awkward and do not clearly convey the intended meaning.
- [CLARITY] The text uses archaic or overly poetic language in a way that can obscure meaning (e.g., “the innocent cause of no little speculation,” “the finger of time has am plainly pointing”).

The text lacks a clear narrative or logical structure, and the connections between ideas are often unclear or forced.
