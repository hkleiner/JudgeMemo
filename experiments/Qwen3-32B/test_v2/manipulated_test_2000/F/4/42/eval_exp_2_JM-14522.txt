### **Coherence Issues**

- [LOGIC] The transition from the introduction of the Otis family to the appearance of the ghost is abrupt and lacks foreshadowing or buildup, making the ghost’s sudden appearance feel jarring.
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps from the arrival at Canterville Chase to the ghost’s appearance with little narrative buildup or explanation of how the ghost was discovered.
- [LOGIC] The ghost appears suddenly without prior setup or character introduction, which disrupts the flow and makes the scene feel disconnected from the previous narrative.
- [LOGIC] The ghost’s reaction to the American Minister’s practical solution is not clearly explained or justified, making the interaction confusing
