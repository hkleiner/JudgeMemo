**Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors are present, such as "establisjed," "unvommon," "confidenve," "ifmthey," "doctrime," "groundworknof," "srrvice," "Adoration," "realnPresence," "investigatemin," "glessed," "6th chapternof," "prssent," "vby," "Rome teaches thatvby," " wnd," "Daviour," "witbout," "ctwo." These errors disrupt readability and comprehension.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, making it difficult to follow the intended meaning. For example, "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." The structure is unclear and confusing.
- [LEXICON] Redundant or overly complex word choice is present, such as "sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by faith on the most precious body and blood of our glessed Saviour." This phrasing is unnecessarily wordy and hinders clarity.
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or vague, such as "the real groundworknof that opinion were examined." The meaning is not clearly conveyed due to poor word choice and structure.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation is present in multiple places, such as "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapternof St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." This makes the sentence difficult to parse.

**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The argument sometimes jumps between ideas without clear transitions, such as from a discussion of the Church of England’s stance to an explanation of Rome’s teachings without sufficient connection. This creates a disjointed flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, consistent structure. For example, the section on the Articles begins abruptly and is not well-integrated with the previous discussion. This makes it difficult to follow the overall argument.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and ideas are weak or missing. For instance, the shift from discussing the nature of the Eucharist to the Church’s documents is not clearly signaled, making the logical progression unclear.
- [COHERENCE] Some sections introduce new ideas or terminology (e.g., "Real Presence," "Adoration," "Sacrifice") without sufficient explanation or context, making it hard for the reader to follow the discussion.

**Final Ratings:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
*The text lacks clear logical flow and transitions between ideas. The argument is often disjointed, and new concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation or connection to the previous content. The structure is inconsistent, and the reader is left to infer many connections.*

FINAL Fluency Score: 2  
*The text is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, awkward syntax, and unclear phrasing. These issues significantly impede readability and comprehension. The word choice is often overly complex or redundant, and the punctuation is inconsistent, making the text difficult to follow smoothly.*
