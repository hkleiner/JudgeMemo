**Issues Affecting Fluency and Coherence:**

- [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors throughout the text, such as “It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye.” The verb tense and structure are inconsistent and awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] “In America, these goings-on werebknown to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference.” The missing space and incorrect word “werebknown” is a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] “There werecderivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?” The word “werecderivative” is a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] “In a few months Iron Ore moves into a new store-building.” The tense is inconsistent with the rest of the narrative, which is in past tense.
- [GRAMMAR] “It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse om Baltimore Street im Lynn, Massachusetts.” The misspellings “om” and “im” instead of “on” and “in” are problematic.
- [GRAMMAR] “The blackboard is coveref with chalk drawings.” “Coveref” is a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] “You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, ismsitting on the platform.” “Ism” is a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] “The employees wre all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably.” “Wre” is a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] “Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi.” “Pi” is likely a typo for “type” or “ink.”
- [GRAMMAR] “You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and rethrn with a supply of unfinished.” “Rethrn” is a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] “With your savings you buy a printing press. It is the kind you place on a table and slap with the palm of your hand.” The sentence is awkward and unclear in its description.
- [GRAMMAR] “Your mother keeps house for your cousins. Every night when you go to bed you kneel down and ask God to tell your uncle to bring you a printing press, the kind with a lever, like the ones shown in the Youth’s Companion. Your uncle brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch.” The sentence structure is confusing and lacks logical flow.
- [GRAMMAR] “You don’t like arithmetic, anyway.” The phrase is abrupt and stylistically inconsistent.
- [GRAMMAR] “You are put ro work washing-up a Gordon press.” “Ro” is a typo for “to.”
- [GRAMMAR] “Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay og a lower-case beside the window.” “Og” is a typo for “of.”
- [GRAMMAR] “The two jobbers are kicked.” The phrase is vague and unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] “When the motor power fails, as it does freauently, you go out on the street and employ off-shift miners to operate the prdss by means of a crank attached to the flywheel.” “Freauently” and “prdss” are typos.
- [GRAMMAR] “You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and “borrow” packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler.” The sentence is awkward and lacks clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] “The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon.” The transition between these sentences is abrupt and lacks coherence.
- [GRAMMAR] “The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window.” The sentences are disjointed and lack smooth transition.
- [GRAMMAR] “In one wrapper he pretends to place amfive dollar bill--a version of them“old army game.”” “Amfive” and “them“old” are typos.
- [LEXICON] Redundant or awkward phrasing such as “He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too.” The phrase “in another way, too” is redundant.
- [LOGIC] Some sentences lack clear logical connections or context, such as “He gives you much fine advice which you never forget.” It is unclear what the advice was or how it relates to the rest of the narrative.
- [LOGIC] “You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week.” The transition from child to working man is abrupt and lacks explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions or signposting, making it difficult to follow the chronological flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is written in a very episodic and disjointed manner, with little to
