**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The story abruptly shifts from dialogue to narrative to internal thoughts with minimal transitions, making the flow of the story feel disjointed at times.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from the Otis family's arrival to the reappearance of the bloodstain and then to the ghost's appearance, without smooth transitions or clear cause-effect connections.
- [LOGIC] The reappearance of the bloodstain is introduced suddenly without prior setup or foreshadowing, which could confuse the reader about its significance.
- [LOGIC] The ghost's sudden appearance and the twins' pillow-throwing are presented without prior build-up or context, making the scene feel somewhat jarring.
- [CLARITY] The tone shifts between formal narration and casual American dialogue, which may confuse the reader about the intended style.
- [LOGIC] The ghost’s reaction to the "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" is introduced without prior explanation of his character or motivations, making the scene feel abrupt.
