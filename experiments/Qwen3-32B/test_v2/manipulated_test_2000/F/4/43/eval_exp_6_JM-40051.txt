### Evaluation of the Story: *"Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden"*

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" – awkward phrasing; "a reasonable thing of it" is unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville / CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" – formatting inconsistency and unclear meaning.
- [SYNTAX] "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the garden of the Lord;" – awkward placement of semicolon and lack of clarity.
- [LEXICON] "river here, as in most places, has three banks" – unclear and redundant; "banks" can refer to sides of a river, not three distinct ones.
- [GRAMMAR] "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river..." – this sentence is incoherent and likely a fragment or error.
- [GRAMMAR] "But possession as been Christians garden disappearing taken have the, have hanging are the or, of serpents destroyed." – completely incoherent sentence; likely a fragment or error.
- [SYNTAX] "Not the very unfit, a, uninhabitable grand romantic but garden beau the a garden, ideal for but or like of small Yosemite." – sentence is jumbled and nonsensical.
- [LEXICON] "The soil is not a deep, rich paste..." – "paste" is an unusual and imprecise word choice for describing soil.
- [GRAMMAR] "the second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark" – misspelled "hightest" should be "highest."

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The story assumes the reader is familiar with specific historical or religious references (e.g., "antldiluvians") without explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between geographical descriptions, theological claims, and historical references with little to no transition.
- [LOGIC] The argument that Eden is in the Mississippi River valley is not clearly supported or logically developed; it relies on vague comparisons (e.g., "Euphrates" = "Mississippi").
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the garden to discussing rattlesnakes and then to the city of La Crosse is abrupt and lacks logical flow.
- [LOGIC] The text conflates historical and mythological claims without distinguishing between them, leading to confusion.
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph begins with a fragmented and incoherent sentence, undermining the overall structure of the conclusion.
- [CLARITY] Phrases like "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'" are vague and lack clarity.
- [LOGIC] The author claims the garden is "central in this domain, Eden," but provides no evidence or reasoning for this assertion.
