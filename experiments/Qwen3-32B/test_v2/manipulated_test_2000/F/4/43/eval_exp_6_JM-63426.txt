**EVALUATION OF THE TEXT: “WILL BRADLEY: HIS CHAP BOOK”**

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] “Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work.” – This sentence is a grammatical and syntactic disaster. It is ungrammatical, incoherent, and impossible to understand without context or correction.
- [SYNTAX] “The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window.” – These sentences are structurally simple and repetitive; while not incorrect, they lack variation and flow.
- [LEXICON] “The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably.” – The word “natives” is ambiguous here. It could refer to people from a specific region, but the clarification “Universalists and Unitarians” is not clearly connected.
- [GRAMMAR] “bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'” – This is a severely broken sentence with incorrect word order and missing punctuation.
- [CLARITY] “You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do.” – This is a non-English construction and completely unclear.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The story shifts abruptly from a biographical narrative of Will Bradley to a detailed childhood account of “Willie” with little transition or explanation of how this relates to Bradley. The connection is unclear.
- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter reads more like a fictionalized biography of a young boy than a continuation of the introduction to Will Bradley. The lack of clear linkage between the two chapters weakens the overall coherence.
- [TRANSITION] There is no clear transition between the first chapter (introduction to Bradley’s legacy) and the second chapter (narrative of a boy printer in Ishpeming). The shift is jarring and unexplained.
- [LOGIC] The second chapter is written in a first-person narrative style with a child's voice, but it is unclear whether this is a fictionalized account of Bradley’s early life or a separate story. This creates confusion for the reader.
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear organizational structure. The first chapter is a reflective essay, while the second is a narrative. Without a clear purpose or transition, the two feel disconnected.

### **FINAL Coherence Score: 2**
The text suffers from a lack of clear organization and logical flow. The two chapters feel disconnected, with little to no transition between them. The second chapter reads like a separate story, and the connection to Will Bradley is unclear, undermining the coherence of the entire work.

### **FINAL Fluency Score: 2**
The text contains numerous grammatical errors, syntactic issues, and incoherent phrases, especially in the second chapter. Some sentences are nearly illegible, and the language often lacks clarity and readability. While parts of the first chapter are well-written, the overall fluency is significantly impaired.
