**Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] – The text contains several grammatical errors, including missing articles, incorrect prepositions, and sentence fragments. For example, “That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.” This sentence is incoherent and appears to be a fragment or error in formatting.

- [SYNTAX] – There are many long, run-on sentences that are difficult to follow. For example: “The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church.” The syntax is awkward and disrupts the flow of reading.

- [LEXICON] – Some word choices are archaic or unclear in context, such as “pleases being signified His by the but being the that.” These phrases are not only difficult to parse but also seem to be malformed.

- [CLARITY] – Certain phrases are vague or ambiguous, such as “It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift.” The meaning is somewhat clear, but the phrasing is awkward and confusing.

- [GRAMMAR] – There are missing or misplaced commas and punctuation, such as in the sentence: “The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church.” The em dash and semicolon usage is inconsistent and confusing.

**Coherence Issues:**

- [STRUCTURE] – The text lacks a clear structure in some sections. For example, the discussion of the Articles begins well but quickly becomes disorganized and difficult to follow due to the lack of clear paragraphing and logical progression.

- [LOGIC] – There are gaps in reasoning in certain parts of the text. For instance, the argument about the sacraments and the Church of England's doctrine is introduced but not always clearly connected to the supporting evidence.

- [TRANSITION] – Transitions between ideas are often abrupt or missing. For example, the text shifts from a discussion of the Articles to a theological argument without a clear link or explanation.

- [LOGIC] – The argument about the Church of England’s stance on the Real Presence is presented as if it is a clear and consistent position, but the text itself is contradictory or unclear in places, making it difficult to follow the intended argument.

- [STRUCTURE] – The final paragraph about the Articles is particularly disorganized, with ideas presented in a jumbled and confusing order, making it difficult to understand the author’s intended point.
