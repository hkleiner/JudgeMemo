### **Fluency Issues**

[SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted and difficult to follow. For example: “The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful ‘A. by a late,’ deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a).” This sentence is incoherent and lacks proper grammatical structure.

[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors and missing words. For instance: “Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood. She detests her client, Jasper, and plays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.” The sentence is correct, but the prior paragraph is full of fragmented and incomplete sentences.

[LEXICON] Word choice is sometimes awkward or redundant. For example: “He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.” The phrase “rich in secrets and surprises” is vague and redundant in context.

[CLARITY] The text is often unclear or ambiguous. For example: “He is being watched by the hag, who hates him.” The pronoun “he” could refer to multiple characters, making the sentence confusing.

[SYNTAX] The sentence “This sixteen, hag determined, we learn hard,”—for a been drunkard,—“I heaven’s-years drank has before she took to opium.” is grammatically incorrect and incoherent, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.

[GRAMMAR] The sentence “If she has been dealing in opium for ten years (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper’s birth.” is awkward and confusing due to the structure and lack of clarity.

[SYNTAX] The sentence “The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium.” is syntactically correct, but the prior paragraph is full of run-on and fragmented sentences that disrupt fluency.

[CLARITY] The sentence “He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?” is confusing and lacks a clear logical flow.

[GRAMMAR] The sentence “‘Take it as a warning,’ Jasper says, but Edwin, puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not understand.” is grammatically correct, but the prior paragraph is filled with grammatically incorrect sentences.

### **Coherence Issues**

[STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is inconsistent. The introduction is dense with literary analysis, but the story section is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative progression.

[LOGIC] The reasoning is often unclear or missing. For example, the connection between Dickens’s health and the construction of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* is not clearly explained.

[TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between ideas and sections. For example, the transition from the introduction to the “Story” section is jarring and lacks a smooth flow.

[LOGIC] The explanation of the characters and their relationships is confusing. For example, the relationship between John Jasper, Edwin Drood, and the hag is not clearly established.

[STRUCTURE] The story section lacks a clear narrative arc. It begins with a vision, moves to character introductions, and then jumps to a scene with Sapsea and Durdles without clear transitions.

[LOGIC] The explanation of the plot is often vague or incomplete. For example, the role of the Cathedral tower is introduced but never fully explained.

[LOGIC] The connection between the analysis of Dickens’s writing and the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* is not clearly made, leading to confusion about the author’s intent.

[STRUCTURE] The story section is poorly organized. It begins with a vision, then introduces characters, and then jumps to a scene in a crypt without clear context or transitions.

[TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the “Story” section is abrupt and lacks a clear link between the analysis and the narrative.
