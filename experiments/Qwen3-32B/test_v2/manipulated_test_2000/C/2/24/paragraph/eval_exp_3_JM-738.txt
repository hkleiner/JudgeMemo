**[FLUENCY ISSUES]**

- **[GRAMMAR]**: "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutely 'essential.'" – The placement of "that" after "think" is awkward and unidiomatic. A smoother construction would be "Some critics may think that, since so many of the best novels in the world have no outline..."

- **[SYNTAX]**: "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." – The sentence is confusingly structured. The phrase "combined with some of the elements... careful study of character" is unclear in its relation to the rest of the sentence.

- **[LEXICON]**: "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'" – The phrase "the first sprightly runnings" is archaic and unclear, which may confuse modern readers.

- **[GRAMMAR]**: "We may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life." – The use of quotation marks around "that" is unnecessary and confusing. It should be written without them for clarity.

- **[CLARITY]**: "He saw in his vision, 'that, I never saw that before.'" – The sentence is grammatically awkward and the use of quotation marks is unclear. It should be rewritten for clarity, perhaps as "He saw in his vision something he had never seen before."

**[COHERENCE ISSUES]**

- **[LOGIC]**: The transition between the introduction of Dickens's health and the analysis of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* is abrupt. There is no clear explanation of how Dickens's health affected his writing of the novel.

- **[STRUCTURE]**: The story jumps between a literary analysis of Dickens and the plot summary of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* without clear transitions. The narrative is disjointed, and the reader is left to infer connections.

- **[LOGIC]**: The introduction of the "Princess Puffer" and her relationship to John Jasper is presented without sufficient background or explanation, making it hard to follow the logic of her role in the story.

- **[LOGIC]**: The claim that "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in _Mugby Junction_." is presented without sufficient context or explanation, making it confusing to understand how it relates to the analysis of *Edwin Drood*.

- **[STRUCTURE]**: The paragraph introducing the dramatis personae is followed abruptly by the "OPENING OF THE TALE" section, with no clear transition or summary of how the characters relate to the plot.

- **[TRANSITION]**: The sentence "A cloud upload completed." is completely out of place and has no connection to the narrative. It disrupts the flow and coherence of the text.

- **[TRANSITION]**: "The digital assistant logged the entry." is similarly out of place and has no relevance to the story or analysis. It disrupts the logical flow of the text.

- **[LOGIC]**: The mention of "A livestream began recording." is also completely out of place and unrelated to the content of the story or analysis. It breaks the coherence of the text.
