### **Fluency and Coherence Assessment**

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] "A hologram displayed the weather." – This sentence is grammatically correct but jarringly out of place in an 1800s-style narrative.
- [GRAMMAR] "A bluetooth signal was detected." – Again, grammatically correct but anachronistic and disrupts the story's tone.
- [GRAMMAR] "A surveillance camera moved slightly." – Also grammatically correct but anachronistic and breaks the narrative immersion.
- [LEXICON] "I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody." – "Old country" is vague and lacks clarity in context.
- [SYNTAX] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." – Awkward phrasing; smoother as "I have always believed that emigration is the only solution for England."

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of anachronistic elements like a hologram, Bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera disrupts the narrative's historical setting and undermines the story’s internal logic.
- [STRUCTURE] The story transitions abruptly from the Otis family's arrival to the introduction of the ghost, with little narrative buildup or emotional preparation.
- [CLARITY] "I have seen things with my own eyes, sir, that would make any Christian's hair stand on end..." – Vague and lacks specificity, making it less impactful.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's arrival and tea in the library to the ghost’s appearance in Chapter II is abrupt and lacks smooth narrative flow.
- [LOGIC] The ghost’s sudden appearance and violent reaction to the lubricant feel rushed and underdeveloped, with little buildup or character motivation.
