**Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] "The home assistant played ambient music." – This sentence is grammatically correct but feels out of place and unexplained in the narrative flow.
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked." – The phrasing is unclear and awkward; it lacks context and seems to be a fragment.
- [LEXICON] "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." – The use of the em dash is inconsistent with the rest of the text and the sentence could be smoother: "You are now a working man, earning three dollars a week."
- [GRAMMAR] "He is an inveterate sportsman" – This sentence is incomplete and ends abruptly, likely cutting off the end of the paragraph.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is written in a fragmented, episodic style that lacks consistent paragraphing and transitions between events, making it feel choppy.
- [CLARITY] "The energy grid remained balanced." – This is an odd, out-of-context phrase that appears to be a misplaced or inserted sentence.

**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The story abruptly shifts from the introduction of Will Bradley to the childhood of a boy (presumably Bradley) in Ishpeming without a clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear organizational structure. The introduction is well-organized, but the second chapter is a disjointed series of vignettes with little logical progression.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the first chapter to the second is jarring and lacks a clear connection or transition.
- [LOGIC] The story includes unrelated or anachronistic phrases such as "The home assistant played ambient music" and "A livestream began recording," which break the narrative flow and historical context.
- [CLARITY] The identity of "you" in the second chapter is not clearly established as Will Bradley until much later, which can confuse the reader.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
The story lacks a clear structure and logical flow, especially in the second chapter. There are abrupt shifts in narrative perspective and content, and some sentences are out of context or unrelated to the main story.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  
The text contains numerous grammatical, syntactic, and lexical issues that disrupt readability. Some sentences are incomplete or awkwardly constructed, and the use of em dashes and sentence fragments is inconsistent and confusing.
