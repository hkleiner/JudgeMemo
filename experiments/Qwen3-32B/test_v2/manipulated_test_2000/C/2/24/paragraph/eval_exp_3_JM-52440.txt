### Evaluation of the Story: *The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England*

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] The phrase “The voice recognition module powered up” and “The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb” are out of context and grammatically disconnected from the surrounding theological text. These sentences appear to be inserted randomly and disrupt the flow.
- [GRAMMAR] In the line “The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject;” the use of em dashes is inconsistent and confusing. A more standard punctuation choice (e.g., colons or parentheses) would improve readability.
- [LEXICON] Some phrases are overly verbose and repetitive, such as “the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour” and “the precious body and blood of our blessed Lord and Saviour,” which appear multiple times with little variation. This reduces fluency by making the text feel redundant.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence “The Church of England includes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she never alludes to any change in the sign or elements.” is awkwardly structured. A smoother version might be: “The Church of England includes both sacraments under one definition, and in that definition, she never mentions any change in the sign or elements.”
- [CLARITY] The phrase “The biosensor updated its readout” is completely out of context and adds no meaning or clarity. It is confusing and detracts from the overall fluency of the text.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from a theological discussion to the unrelated phrases “The voice recognition module powered up” and “The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb.” These sentences break the logical flow and suggest the text may be a fragment or corrupted version of a longer work.
- [STRUCTURE] The document is organized into chapters, but the introduction and first chapter are not clearly separated. The formatting is inconsistent, with some headings in all caps and others in title case. This lack of consistent structure affects the overall coherence.
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially in the longer theological discussions. For example, the shift from discussing the sacraments to the Articles is abrupt and could be improved with a clearer transition.
- [LOGIC] The argument is complex and theological, but it is generally logically structured within its own framework. The author builds a case by first defining terms, then referencing Church documents, and finally drawing conclusions. However, the random insertions of unrelated sentences disrupt the coherence of the argument.
- [CLARITY] The phrase “The biosensor updated its readout” is completely unclear in the context of a theological treatise and suggests either an error or an incomplete text. This line has no logical connection to the rest of the content and breaks the reader’s engagement.

### **Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

The text is generally well-written and logically structured within its theological framework, but it is marred by the inclusion of out-of-place and unrelated sentences that disrupt both fluency and coherence.
