**Issues Affecting Fluency and Coherence:**

- [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical issues, such as missing articles, inconsistent capitalization, and awkward verb usage (e.g., "the documents of the stuff are not studied" — "stuff" is unclear and likely a placeholder or error).
- [LEXICON] The word "stuff" is used multiple times in place of a proper noun (e.g., "the Church of England"), making the text confusing and reducing clarity.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the documents of the stuff" is vague and does not clearly refer to any known entity, making it difficult to follow the author’s argument.
- [LOGIC] The logic in some parts is weak or inconsistent. For example, the author states they are not discussing Scripture but then references Scripture extensively, which creates confusion about the focus.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat disjointed. Paragraphs often begin with a new idea without sufficient transition from the previous one, and the organization of ideas is not consistently logical or thematic.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between ideas and paragraphs are often abrupt or missing, making the flow of the argument difficult to follow.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them hard to parse. For example: "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." This sentence is grammatically confusing and lacks clarity.
- [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear and consistent thesis. The author seems to be both defending and questioning the doctrine of the Real Presence, which creates confusion about the central argument.
