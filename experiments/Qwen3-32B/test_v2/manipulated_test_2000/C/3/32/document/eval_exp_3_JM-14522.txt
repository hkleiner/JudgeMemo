**Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] "a thing" and "a stuff" are repeated in place of proper names or titles, making the text confusing and grammatically incorrect.
- [GRAMMAR] "Lord a thing" and "Lord the thing" are grammatically incorrect and nonsensical.
- [GRAMMAR] "Lord a stuff" is grammatically incorrect and lacks coherence.
- [LEXICON] "a thing Street" is unclear and likely a placeholder, not a real reference.
- [SYNTAX] "The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed." – The sentence is awkward and lacks clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] "The thing" is used repeatedly in place of names, creating confusion and grammatical errors.
- [SYNTAX] "Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the thing when connected with Crime." – The sentence is confusing and lacks a clear structure.

**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" in place of proper names or titles breaks the logical flow of the narrative.
- [LOGIC] The story references specific characters and events (e.g., Lady Eleanore de Canterville, Sir Simon de Canterville) but fails to maintain consistency in character names and titles elsewhere.
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the introduction of the Otis family to the ghostly events is abrupt and lacks smooth narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the ghost’s appearance to the twins throwing a pillow is sudden and lacks a logical connection.
- [CLARITY] The use of "the thing" and "a stuff" is vague and makes the text confusing for the reader.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from one scene to another without sufficient context or explanation, making it hard to follow the story’s progression.
