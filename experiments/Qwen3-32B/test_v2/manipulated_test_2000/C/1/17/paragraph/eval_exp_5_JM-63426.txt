**FLUENCY ISSUES:**

- [GRAMMAR] “He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work.” – The phrase “it didn’t work” is vague and lacks clarity; it should specify what did not work (e.g., “that model didn’t work” or “that ambition didn’t work out”).
- [GRAMMAR] “The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater.” – The comparison is unclear; it should be clearer what “backwater” refers to (e.g., “more than any European backwater”).
- [GRAMMAR] “He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling.” – The sentence is awkward and convoluted. It should be rephrased for clarity.
- [SYNTAX] “He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too.” – The phrase “in another way, too” is awkward and could be rephrased for smoother flow.
- [LEXICON] “There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body” – “Lusty” is an unusual word choice in this context and may confuse readers.
- [SYNTAX] “He detached his arm from his companion’s to grasp the hand of the older friend.” – The sentence is clear but awkwardly structured.
- [GRAMMAR] “Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances.” – The sentence is grammatically correct, but the subject shift (from Sir Simon to “her”) is confusing and likely a misplaced sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The story shifts abruptly from the introduction about Will Bradley to a narrative about Stransom and Paul Creston, then back to Bradley. This creates confusion and disrupts the flow.
- [CLARITY] “He noticed you, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal acquaintance he would not trouble you.” – The pronouns and context are unclear and confusing.

**COHERENCE ISSUES:**

- [LOGIC] The introduction is about Will Bradley and his influence on American graphic arts, but then shifts to a narrative involving Stransom and Paul Creston, which seems unrelated and disrupts the focus.
- [STRUCTURE] The story moves from the introduction to a detailed childhood narrative of Will Bradley, but the transition is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
- [LOGIC] The section about Sir Simon and the Chase appears to be a misplaced paragraph from a different story. It has no connection to Will Bradley or the rest of the text and is confusing.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the childhood narrative is jarring and lacks a smooth transition. The reader is left wondering why the story suddenly jumps to a different time and setting.
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Iron Ore print shop and the fake soap seller is detailed but feels disconnected from the broader narrative of Will Bradley’s life and career.
