After carefully reading the text, I will now assess it on fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues that affect the quality of the writing.

### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] "He laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, ‘No, in talent and vigour.’" – The sentence is grammatically incomplete and lacks a subject for the quoted response, making it unclear who said what.
- [SYNTAX] "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast, they found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor." – The transition between these two sentences is abrupt and lacks a logical connector.
- [LEXICON] "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred." – The phrase "nothing of particular note occurred" is redundant and awkward; a simpler phrase like "nothing significant happened" would be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appeared again." – The phrase "the second morning it appeared again" is confusing and should be rephrased for clarity (e.g., "it appeared again the next morning").
- [CLARITY] "He felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near her." – The structure is awkward and could be improved for smoother reading (e.g., "As he walked away, he felt quite determined never to go near her again in his life").
- [GRAMMAR] "His precautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the people at home would never have mentioned extradition." – The sentence is overly complex and lacks clear subject-verb agreement.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different narrative threads with no clear transitions. It begins with a dialogue, moves into a religious theological discussion, then into a ghost story, and ends with a character’s emotional reaction. These shifts are abrupt and disorienting.
- [LOGIC] The theological section about the Church of England and the Real Presence is disconnected from the other narrative elements (the ghost story, the character of George Stransom). There is no clear thematic or narrative link between these parts.
- [LOGIC] The introduction of characters like Jasper, Sapsea, and Durdles is not explained in the context of the rest of the text, making it unclear how they relate to the other parts of the story.
- [TRANSITION] There is no transition between the ghost story and the theological discussion. The shift from "The storm raged fiercely all that night..." to "He felt quite determined..." is jarring and confusing.
- [LOGIC] The ending about George Stransom and his emotional reaction to Kate Creston is introduced without prior context or setup, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the characters or the situation.

### **Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
*The text lacks a clear narrative structure and logical flow. It jumps between unrelated topics and characters with no transitions, making it difficult to follow and understand the overall message or story.*

FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
*The text is generally readable but suffers from awkward phrasing, grammatical issues, and unclear sentence structures. Some parts are difficult to parse, and the writing lacks the smoothness and clarity expected in high-quality prose.*
