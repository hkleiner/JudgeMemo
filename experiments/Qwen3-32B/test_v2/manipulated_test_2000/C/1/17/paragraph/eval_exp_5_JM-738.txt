### **Fluency and Coherence Assessment**

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] The phrase “He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.” is missing a comma after “plots,” making the sentence slightly awkward.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence “He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.” is overly complex and could be split for clarity.
- [LEXICON] The phrase “the manner of ‘hab nab at a venture’” is archaic and may be confusing to modern readers without context.
- [GRAMMAR] “The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is ‘Watched by the Dead,’ by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).” – the structure is convoluted and could be rephrased for smoother reading.
- [CLARITY] The phrase “the hag, who hates him” is vague and lacks clarity about *who* “him” refers to in some contexts.
- [GRAMMAR] “He is being watched by the hag, who hates him.” – the passive voice is acceptable but could be made more direct for fluency.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative thread in the first half; it reads more like a literary analysis or essay than a story, which may confuse readers expecting a narrative.
- [LOGIC] The transition from a discussion of Dickens’s writing style to the character introduction is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative setup.
- [TRANSITION] The story jumps from a literary analysis of Dickens to the introduction of fictional characters and then to a scene with Lord Canterville and a ghost reference, which seems out of place and unrelated to the rest of the text.
- [LOGIC] The quote about Lord Canterville and the ghost is completely disconnected from the previous content and the supposed story of *Edwin Drood*, creating a jarring and incoherent shift.
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a consistent point of view or narrative voice. It shifts between a critical essay, character introduction, and a fictional scene without clear transitions or purpose.
- [LOGIC] The reference to Lord Canterville and the ghost seems to be a fragment from *The Picture of Dorian Gray* or another unrelated story, which does not fit within the context of *Edwin Drood* or the rest of the text.

### **Final Scores**

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
*The text is poorly organized, with abrupt shifts between literary analysis, character introduction, and an unrelated ghost quote. The narrative lacks a clear structure and logical flow.*

FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
*The text is generally readable but contains several grammatical, syntactic, and lexical issues that hinder smooth reading. Some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly phrased.*
