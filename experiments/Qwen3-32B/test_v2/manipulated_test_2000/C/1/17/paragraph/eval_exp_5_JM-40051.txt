### **Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] “He, evidently, must place him somewhere” – Awkward phrasing; "must place him" should be "must have placed him" for proper tense and clarity.
- [GRAMMAR] “how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts” – Run-on sentence; missing punctuation and unclear structure.
- [GRAMMAR] “and as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was” – Misplaced comma; awkward syntax.
- [GRAMMAR] “But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it.” – Awkward phrasing; "commenced developing" is unnecessarily wordy.
- [LEXICON] “and admirirg its most wonderful scenery” – Spelling error ("admirirg" should be "admiring").
- [LEXICON] “proper dimentions” – Spelling error ("dimentions" should be "dimensions").
- [GRAMMAR] “Where would a scientest place the first pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth?” – Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.
- [GRAMMAR] “It is located on the “eastward bank” of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota.” – Missing comma after "Wisconsin."
- [GRAMMAR] “The river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the “Laughing” and “Father of waters,” courses, run, and play their dances.” – Confusing syntax and inconsistent subject-verb agreement ("courses" vs. "run").
- [GRAMMAR] “The second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark” – Spelling error ("hightest" should be "highest").
- [GRAMMAR] “The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium.” – Sudden shift to a different narrative voice and character, making the sentence feel disconnected.
- [GRAMMAR] “He felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near her.” – Awkward phrasing; could be clearer as “He felt quite determined never to go near her again.”
- [GRAMMAR] “But as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.” – Sudden shift in narrative tone and subject.
- [GRAMMAR] “He could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if the man to whom she had given everything couldn’t.” – Ambiguous pronoun reference ("he" and "man" are unclear without context).
- [STRUCTURE] The story abruptly shifts between multiple unrelated narratives (e.g., the author’s discovery of Eden, Jasper and Rosa, Canterville Chase, and George Stransom), with no transitions or explanations. This disrupts the flow and makes the text feel disjointed.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The text claims to be a single story about the discovery of the Garden of Eden, but it randomly introduces unrelated narratives (e.g., Jasper and Rosa, Canterville Chase, George Stransom), with no clear connection or transition between them.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a coherent structure. It jumps between different topics, locations, and characters without any logical progression or organization.
- [LOGIC] The author discusses the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, but then shifts to unrelated fictional narratives with no explanation of how they relate.
- [TRANSITION] There are no transitions between the different sections. For example, the story abruptly shifts from the author’s discovery of Eden to a narrative about Jasper and Rosa, then to Canterville Chase, and then to George Stransom, with no indication that these are separate stories.
- [LOGIC] The argument about the Garden of Eden is weak and speculative, with no clear evidence or reasoning provided to support the claims.
- [CLARITY] The author uses vague and ambiguous language, such as “the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the ‘North West’,” without clarifying what this means or how it supports the claim.
- [LOGIC] The author claims to have found the Garden of Eden, but then introduces fictional narratives that are not connected to the main argument, making it unclear whether the text is a historical essay, a fictional story, or a mix of both.
- [LOGIC] The author mentions the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley, but then shifts to a description of the garden that seems to describe a generic American landscape, not a specific historical or biblical site.
- [LOGIC] The text ends with a completely
