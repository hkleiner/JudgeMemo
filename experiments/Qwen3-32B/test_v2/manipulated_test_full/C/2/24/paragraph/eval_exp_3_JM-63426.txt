### Evaluation of the Story: *Will Bradley: His Chap Book*

---

### **Fluency Issues**

- [GRAMMAR] Several run-on sentences and missing commas create readability problems, especially in long descriptive passages. For example: “He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too. It was a time when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious ambition for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited editions for equally limited collectors.”
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly structured, such as: “He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work.” The phrasing is abrupt and lacks clarity.
- [LEXICON] Word choice is occasionally redundant or overly archaic, such as: “You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform, proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself.” The repetition of “proud” is unnecessary.
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or ambiguous. For example: “The motion sensor caught a brief movement” and “The 3D printer finished the replica” are out of context and disrupt the narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or missing, especially when moving between time periods or locations, which can confuse the reader.

### **Coherence Issues**

- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes jumps between time periods or events without sufficient context. For example, the story shifts from the protagonist’s childhood to his career in Chicago without clear signposting.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is organized into chapters, but the structure is inconsistent. Some chapters read like biographical essays, while others resemble vignettes or memoirs. This inconsistency can make it difficult to follow the overall narrative arc.
- [LOGIC] Some plot points are introduced without sufficient explanation or background. For example, the protagonist’s early career in Ishpeming is described in detail, but the transition to Chicago is abrupt and lacks motivation.
- [LOGIC] There are a number of anachronisms and inconsistencies in the timeline, particularly in the “Chronology” section at the end. For example, the story describes events in 1954, but the timeline lists events in the same year, making it unclear whether these are fictional or historical.
- [STRUCTURE] The “Afterword” and “Chronology” at the end are useful, but their placement and integration into the main narrative are somewhat disjointed. They feel like an afterthought rather than a natural extension of the story.
