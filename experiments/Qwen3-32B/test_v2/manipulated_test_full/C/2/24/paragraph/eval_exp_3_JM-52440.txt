### Issues Identified in the Text

#### [FLUENCY] - Grammar and Syntax Issues
- [GRAMMAR] The sentence "A keyboard clicked without being touched." is an isolated, disconnected phrase that does not contribute to the narrative or argument and appears grammatically incomplete.
- [GRAMMAR] "The energy grid remained balanced." is another standalone sentence with no context or explanation, making it feel out of place.
- [GRAMMAR] "A camera lens refocused itself." is similarly disconnected from the main content and lacks grammatical integration with the surrounding text.
- [GRAMMAR] "A drone swarm aligned in formation." is another unrelated sentence that disrupts the flow of the text.
- [GRAMMAR] "A notification chimed twice." is another isolated sentence with no context.
- [GRAMMAR] "A contactless payment completed." is another disjointed sentence.
- [GRAMMAR] "A 3D printer started humming." is another unrelated and disconnected sentence.
- [GRAMMAR] "A smartwatch vibrated gently." is yet another sentence that lacks context and integration.
- [GRAMMAR] "A smart bulb changed color." is another sentence that disrupts the narrative.
- [GRAMMAR] "A smart door slid open smoothly." is another unrelated sentence.
- [GRAMMAR] "A speech recognition unit recorded everything." is another disconnected statement.
- [GRAMMAR] "The iPhone was fully charged now." is another sentence that does not contribute to the main argument or narrative.
- [GRAMMAR] "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions." is another sentence that is out of context and grammatically isolated.

#### [COHERENCE] - Logical Flow and Organization
- [LOGIC] The text is a well-structured theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper as taught by the Church of England. However, the repeated inclusion of unrelated, out-of-context sentences (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched," "A 3D printer started humming") creates confusion and disrupts the logical flow of the argument.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is divided into clear sections (introduction, chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice), and the logic of the argument is sound within each section. However, the random insertion of unrelated sentences breaks the coherence of the structure and makes the text feel fragmented.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth and logical, but the sudden appearance of unrelated sentences breaks the natural progression of the argument.

#### [COHERENCE] - Clarity and Focus
- [CLARITY] The main argument is clearly stated and developed with a logical progression from the introduction to the conclusion. However, the presence of unrelated sentences (e.g., "A smart bulb changed color") introduces ambiguity and distracts from the main focus of the text.
- [CLARITY] The theological argument is well-articulated and accessible, with clear explanations of complex doctrinal points. However, the inclusion of random, contextless sentences reduces the clarity of the overall message.

#### [COHERENCE] - Consistency
- [LOGIC] The argument remains consistent in its claim that the Church of England does not teach the Real Presence, Adoration, or Sacrifice in the Eucharist. However, the random sentences (e.g., "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions") introduce inconsistency and distract from the argument’s focus.

### Final Scores

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3  

**Reasoning:**  
The text is a well-structured theological treatise with a clear argument and logical progression. However, the repeated inclusion of unrelated, contextless sentences (e.g., "A 3D printer started humming," "A smart bulb changed color") severely disrupts both fluency and coherence. These sentences appear to be inserted randomly and do not contribute to the argument or narrative, making the text feel fragmented and incoherent. While the main argument is well-written and coherent in itself, the presence of these disruptive elements lowers the overall scores.
