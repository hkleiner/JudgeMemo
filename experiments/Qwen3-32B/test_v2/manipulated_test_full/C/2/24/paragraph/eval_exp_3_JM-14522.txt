After carefully reading and analyzing the story, I will now assess it for fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues that affected my evaluation.

**Fluency Issues:**

[LEXICON] The text contains some anachronistic or modern references that feel out of place in the 19th-century setting, such as "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover," "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator," and "Doctor Dobell's tincture." These modern products disrupt the historical tone.

[LEXICON] The story occasionally uses overly complex or archaic vocabulary that is inconsistent with the supposed 19th-century setting, such as "phantasmata" and "sanguineous."

[LEXICON] Some word choices are redundant or unnecessarily verbose, such as "a magnificent constitution, and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits" which could be simplified for clarity.

[SYNTAX] There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure that disrupt the flow, such as "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" and "A voice command triggered automation," which seem to be anachronistic and stylistically jarring.

**Coherence Issues:**

[LOGIC] The story includes some confusing or inconsistent elements, such as the sudden appearance of modern technology (e.g., "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions," "A wireless charger powered up," "The biosensor updated its readout") that are not explained and feel out of place in the narrative.

[STRUCTURE] The narrative flow is occasionally disrupted by these modern technological references, which break the immersion in the 19th-century setting and make the story feel disjointed.

[TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt, particularly when the story shifts from the ghost's perspective to the Otis family's reactions without clear connections.

[LOGIC] The resolution of the ghost's story is somewhat rushed and not fully explained, particularly regarding Virginia's journey and what exactly happened in the secret room with the ghost.

[CLARITY] The references to modern technology (e.g., "A self-driving cart turned left") are unclear in their relevance to the story and disrupt the narrative flow.

**Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
