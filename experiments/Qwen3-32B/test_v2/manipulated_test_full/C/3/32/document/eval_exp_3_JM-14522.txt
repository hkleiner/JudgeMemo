### Evaluation of the Text: *The Canterville Ghost*

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

1. **[LEXICON]** The text contains several instances of repetitive and vague word choice, such as "a thing," which appears multiple times without clear context or replacement, causing confusion.
2. **[GRAMMAR]** There are minor grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect prepositions (e.g., "the stuff" instead of a specific place or person).
3. **[SYNTAX]** Some sentences are overly complex or run-on, which affects readability. For example, long descriptions with multiple clauses can be confusing.
4. **[LEXICON]** Some word choices are archaic or inconsistent with the tone (e.g., "a thing" used in place of a name or object).
5. **[CLARITY]** Some phrases are ambiguous or lack context, especially when referring to characters or places with repeated use of "the stuff."

---

### **Coherence Issues:**

1. **[LOGIC]** The repeated use of "the stuff" and "a thing" makes it difficult to follow the narrative and identify characters or places, leading to confusion.
2. **[STRUCTURE]** While the story has a clear narrative arc, the frequent use of vague references and inconsistent naming weakens the overall structure.
3. **[TRANSITION]** Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or unclear, especially when the narrative shifts between humor and horror.
4. **[LOGIC]** The ghost's behavior and motivations are not always clearly explained, making some plot developments feel arbitrary.
5. **[STRUCTURE]** The use of "the stuff" as a placeholder for names and places disrupts the flow and makes the story feel incomplete or unpolished.
