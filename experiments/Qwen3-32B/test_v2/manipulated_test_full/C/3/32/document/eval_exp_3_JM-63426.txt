This is a long, detailed story about the life and career of Will Bradley, an American designer and typographer. I'll assess its fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

[GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example:
- "THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK." (Should be "This is a difficult task.")
- "In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference."
- "There were derivative traces in a thing early work--and whose hasnâ€™t?"

[SYNTAX] The sentence structures are often awkward or confusing. For example:
- "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye."
- "In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference."

[LEXICON] There are many instances of word choice issues and unclear references:
- "In the stuff, these goings-on were known to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference."
- "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably."
- "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform, proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself."

[CLARITY] The text contains numerous vague or ambiguous phrases:
- "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on the stuff in a stuff, Massachusetts, just outside Boston."
- "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston."
- "You are now back with R-M staying half an hour at night and getting to work a half hour earlier in the morning and all is well with the world."

**Coherence Issues:**

[LOGIC] The narrative sometimes jumps abruptly between ideas or time periods without clear transitions:
- The text moves from a description of Will Bradley's early life to a discussion of other artists and movements without clear connections.
- The chronology is often unclear, with time references that are inconsistent or missing.

[STRUCTURE] The organization of the text is problematic:
- The story is written in a highly fragmented style, with frequent shifts between first-person and third-person narration.
- The use of "you" to describe Will Bradley's experiences creates a confusing narrative perspective.
- The text includes many digressions and tangents that don't clearly connect to the main narrative.

[TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often weak or missing:
- The text frequently jumps from one topic to another without clear connections or signposting.
- The use of "stuff" as a placeholder for missing information breaks the flow of the narrative.

**Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
The text has significant coherence issues, including poor organization, weak transitions, and confusing narrative perspective. The frequent use of "stuff" as a placeholder and the inconsistent narrative voice make it difficult to follow the story.

FINAL Fluency Score: 2
The text has numerous fluency issues, including grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and unclear word choices. The frequent use of "stuff" and other placeholders, along with inconsistent capitalization and punctuation, significantly impacts readability.
