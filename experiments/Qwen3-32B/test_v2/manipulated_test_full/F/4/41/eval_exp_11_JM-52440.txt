After carefully reading the provided story, I will assess it on the dimensions of fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues with tags for each.

### Fluency Issues:
1. **[GRAMMAR]** - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text. For example, "The result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, ans place reliance on those who make it" (should be "and place"). These errors disrupt the flow and clarity of the text.

2. **[GRAMMAR]** - "In many cases a blind consent is vlindly given" (should be "blindly"). This kind of typo affects readability.

3. **[GRAMMAR]** - "experiejced" (should be "experienced"), "het that her own language should be patiently heard" (should be "let that her own language"), and "Docteine of the Real Presence" (should be "Doctrine") are all spelling or grammatical errors that make the text harder to follow.

4. **[SYNTAX]** - The sentence structure is often complex and convoluted. For example: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." This structure is confusing and disrupts the natural flow of reading.

5. **[LEXICON]** - The text uses archaic or overly formal language that can be confusing to modern readers. For example, "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" is clear, but some of the theological language is unnecessarily dense and could be simplified for better readability.

6. **[SYNTAX]** - The use of semicolons and em dashes is inconsistent and often confusing. For example: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church." This style is non-standard and makes the text difficult to parse.

7. **[LEXICON]** - There are instances of redundancy, such as "The Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experiejced" – the phrase "such a sifting time" is unnecessarily wordy.

8. **[SYNTAX]** - The text frequently uses run-on sentences that are difficult to follow. For example: "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church. The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in general. 'Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men’s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace, and God’s good willntowards us, by the which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, buy also strengthen and confirm our faith in Him.'" This sentence structure is confusing and hard to follow.

9. **[LEXICON]** - The text uses archaic verb forms and constructions that are difficult for modern readers to understand. For example, "He doth work invisibly in us" – the use of "doth" is archaic and unnecessary in modern writing.

10. **[GRAMMAR]** - There are missing or incorrect punctuation marks throughout the text. For example, in the phrase "It is my own belief that they do not; but yhat is not the present question," the semicolon is unnecessary, and "yhat" is a typo.

### Coherence Issues:
1. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text lacks a clear and consistent structure. It jumps between discussing the Church of England's teachings, theological arguments, and historical context without clear transitions. This makes it difficult for the reader to follow the overall argument.

2. **[LOGIC]** - The argument is dense and complex, with many theological and historical references that are not clearly explained. The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England and its history, which makes it inaccessible to many readers.

3. **[TRANSITION]** - There are weak or missing transitions between paragraphs and sections. For example, the text moves from discussing the Articles of the Church of England to the Catechism without clear explanation or transition. This abrupt shift disrupts the logical flow.

4. **[LOGIC]** - Some arguments are not clearly connected to the main thesis. For example, the detailed discussion of historical figures and the Reformation, while interesting, is not always clearly connected to the central argument about the Church of England's teachings.

5. **[CLARITY]** - The text is often ambiguous or unclear in its phrasing. For example, "The wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as St. Augustine saith) the sacrament
