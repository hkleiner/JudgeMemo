### Fluency Issues

- [GRAMMAR] "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." – The sentence is long and could be broken up for better readability.
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body, and it thrilled him to speak to thousands, even millions, instead of just scores." – The sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly worded.
- [GRAMMAR] "He may have had some such idda in mind when he started the Wayside Press" – "idda" is a misspelling of "idea."

- [GRAMMAR] "So he spread his work over magazines, newspapers, the advertising of such houses as the Strathmore Paper Company, his own lively but not limited publications, even the movjes." – "movjes" is a misspelling of "movies."

- [GRAMMAR] "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item." – The em dash is used correctly, but the sentence could be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and return with a supply of unfinished." – The sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly worded.
- [GRAMMAR] "He brings you a box of pi." – "pi" is likely a typo for "type" or "type letters."
