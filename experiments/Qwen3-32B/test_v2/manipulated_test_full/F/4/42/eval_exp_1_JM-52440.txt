### Fluency Issues:
[GRAMMAR] - There are numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues. For example, "we was taught by our Lord Himself" and "the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour was in the bread and wine."

[SYNTAX] - Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For instance, "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question. My present concern is with the fact that, however we explain His words, we was taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life."

[LEXICON] - The text contains redundant or unclear word choices, such as "we was taught by our Lord Himself" and "the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour was in the bread and wine."

[CLARITY] - Some phrases are ambiguous or confusing, such as "we was taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life" and "the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour was in the bread and wine."

### Coherence Issues:
[LOGIC] - The flow of ideas is sometimes unclear or lacks logical progression. For example, the argument shifts abruptly from discussing the doctrine of the Real Presence to discussing adoration and sacrifice without clear transitions.

[STRUCTURE] - The structure of the text is somewhat disjointed, with some paragraphs and sections not clearly connected to the main argument. For instance, the discussion of the Articles is followed by the Catechism and then the Communion Service, but the connections between these sections are not always clear.

[TRANSITION] - The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often weak or missing, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument. For example, the shift from discussing the Articles to the Catechism is abrupt and lacks a clear explanation of how the two are related.
