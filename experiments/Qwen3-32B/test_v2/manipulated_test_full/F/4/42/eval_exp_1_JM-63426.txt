### Issues Identified in the Text

#### Fluency Issues:
- **[GRAMMAR]**: There are several grammatical errors, such as "I have encounter here the gaiety" (should be "I have encountered"), "He may had had some such idea" (should be "He may have had"), and "You are probably itching to play a little with printing."
- **[SYNTAX]**: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, making them hard to follow, such as "The print shop was above a saloon and in one corner of a big barn of a room that had been a lodge hall."
- **[LEXICON]**: There is some redundancy and awkward word choice, such as "It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye."
- **[CLARITY]**: Some phrases are ambiguous or confusing, such as "He discover American colonial typography" (should be "He discovered American colonial typography").

#### Coherence Issues:
- **[LOGIC]**: Some logical connections are unclear, such as the abrupt shift from discussing Will Bradley's early life to the broader context of 19th-century art movements without clear transitions.
- **[STRUCTURE]**: The story jumps between different time periods and topics without clear organization, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
- **[TRANSITION]**: There are weak transitions between paragraphs and sections, such as the sudden shift from the introduction to the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter without a clear connection.
