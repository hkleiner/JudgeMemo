This is a long and detailed story about Will Bradley, an influential American designer and printer. I'll assess its quality regarding fluency and coherence, identifying specific issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "It about state and it, realize because of should a closed in, to opened entered today the, air room talked hard what is our and--Bradley be to sun and emancipation stuffy." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect. It appears to be a jumble of words with no clear meaning.

2. [SYNTAX] "A there twenty, for, class Michigan a enough left taking about dollar-trunk the into--gold piece depot back pay to to momentous is discovery ticket Northern a last to second you as buy just matter broken of to your-your and shop printing have in fact this for that." - This sentence is a confusing jumble of words with no clear structure or meaning.

3. [LEXICON] "He is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item." - The use of "perhaps" here is redundant and weakens the sentence. It would be clearer to say "He is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily, the Daily Item."

4. [GRAMMAR] "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed." - The phrase "whose hasn’t?" is grammatically incorrect. It should be "who hasn't?" or "who among us hasn't?"

5. [STRUCTURE] The story has long, complex paragraphs with multiple ideas that could be better separated for clarity. For example, the section about Bradley's early work in Ishpeming is dense with information that could benefit from paragraph breaks.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The story jumps abruptly from the introduction to the chapter about Bradley's childhood without clear transitions. This creates a disjointed reading experience.

2. [TRANSITION] There are many abrupt shifts in time and perspective without clear transitions. For example, the story moves from Bradley's childhood in Ishpeming to his work in Chicago with little explanation of how or why this happened.

3. [STRUCTURE] The chronology is sometimes confusing. For example, the story mentions Bradley's retirement but then continues to describe his active career without clear markers.

4. [CLARITY] Some passages are vague or ambiguous. For example, the description of Bradley's early work in Chicago is filled with technical terms without clear explanations for a general reader.

5. [LOGIC] The story sometimes presents information in a confusing order. For example, it describes Bradley's later achievements before fully explaining his early career.

**Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
The story has significant coherence issues with abrupt shifts, confusing chronology, and weak transitions between ideas and sections. While it contains valuable information about Will Bradley, the structure and flow of the narrative are problematic, making it difficult to follow at times.

FINAL Fluency Score: 2
The text has numerous fluency issues, including grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentence structures. Some passages are nearly incomprehensible, and the writing style is inconsistent, ranging from clear and engaging to jumbled and incoherent.
