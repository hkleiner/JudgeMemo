### Issues Identified:

#### Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect word order, and missing or misplaced punctuation.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, making them difficult to parse. For example: "It is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England."
- [LEXICON] There is excessive use of archaic and complex language that is difficult to follow for a modern reader, such as "sifting time," "blind consent," and "mercifully to accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving."
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or ambiguous, such as "the real groundwork of that opinion were examined" and "the wicked are declared to be in no wise partakers of the sacred body and blood."

#### Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Some arguments lack a clear logical progression. For example, the author transitions abruptly from discussing the Church of England's teaching to the actions of "advanced Ritualists" without sufficient context or explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized in a somewhat disjointed manner, with long paragraphs that cover multiple ideas without clear subheadings or transitions.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas and paragraphs are often weak or missing. For instance, the author shifts from discussing the Articles to the Catechism without explaining the relationship between the two.
- [CLARITY] The overall argument is sometimes muddled due to the complexity of the language and the density of theological terminology, making it difficult to follow the author’s reasoning at times.
