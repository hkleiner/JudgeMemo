**Issues Identified in the Text:**

### Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] – “There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?” – The dash is incorrectly used; a comma or colon would be more appropriate.
- [SYNTAX] – “So he spread his work over magazines, newspapers, the advertising of such houses as the Strathmore Paper Company, his own lively but not limited publications, even the movies.” – This sentence is overly long and lacks clear structure, making it difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] – “He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too.” – The phrase “corn-fed” is redundant and informal in a historical narrative context.
- [GRAMMAR] – “You are now on the ‘Narrow Gauge’ on your way to Boston.” – The quotation marks are unnecessary and the sentence is awkwardly phrased.
- [SYNTAX] – “You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week.” – The dash and lack of prepositions make the sentence choppy and unpolished.
- [CLARITY] – “Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window…” – The phrasing is unclear and confusing.
- [GRAMMAR] – “The outside temperature is below zero. You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and ‘borrow’ packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler.” – The transition between sentences is abrupt and the use of quotation marks is unnecessary.

### Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] – The shift from the introduction of Will Bradley to his childhood in Ishpeming is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] – The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without clear indicators, which can confuse the reader.
- [TRANSITION] – The transition between the introduction chapter and the second chapter is missing, making the shift jarring.
- [LOGIC] – The connection between Bradley’s early life and his later career is not clearly explained or foreshadowed.
- [LOGIC] – The narrative of Bradley’s childhood is presented in a very episodic, almost diary-like fashion, which may not be the most effective structure for a biographical or critical introduction.
