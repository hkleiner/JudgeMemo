**FLUENCY ISSUES:**

- [GRAMMAR] The phrase “The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject;” is awkwardly punctuated and should be rephrased for clarity. A smoother version might be: “The Articles: There are seven Articles (xxv. to xxxi.) that bear more or less upon the subject;”

- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, such as: “In other words, before men they are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or witnesses by which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our faith in Him.” This could be split for better readability.

- [LEXICON] The repeated use of “Church of England” is necessary for clarity but may be considered redundant in some instances. For example, in the first paragraph, “the Church of England” is mentioned multiple times within a short span.

- [CLARITY] The phrase “the sign would cease to be a sign if it were changed into the thing signified” is abstract and could be confusing for a general reader. It may benefit from a more concrete example or simpler phrasing.

**COHERENCE ISSUES:**

- [STRUCTURE] The document transitions abruptly from the introduction to the discussion of the Real Presence and then to the examination of the Articles. A clearer transition between these sections would improve the overall flow.

- [LOGIC] The argument is largely consistent, but the reader may find it difficult to follow the distinction between the "real objective presence" and the "spiritual feeding by faith" without prior theological background. A clearer explanation of the key terms would enhance coherence.

- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the general nature of sacraments to focusing specifically on the Lord’s Supper lacks a smooth transition. A sentence or two to bridge the ideas would help the reader follow the argument more easily.

- [LOGIC] The claim that the Church of England’s teaching on the Lord’s Supper is consistent with its teaching on baptism is made without sufficient elaboration. A more detailed comparison would help to solidify the logic of the argument.

**FINAL Coherence Score: 4**  
The text is generally well-organized and the argument is largely logical and consistent. However, the lack of smooth transitions between sections and the need for clearer explanations of theological concepts slightly reduce the overall coherence.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 3**  
The text is mostly clear and readable, but it contains several long, complex sentences and awkward phrasing that hinder fluency. Some grammatical and syntactic improvements would enhance the readability.
