Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and long sentences that are difficult to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] Some awkward phrasing and occasional use of archaic or unclear grammatical constructions.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic and theological vocabulary that may be confusing to modern readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas and semicolons without clear separation of ideas.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly detailed and repetitive, making it difficult to follow the central argument without effort.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is dense and at times circular, with assertions that are not clearly connected to the evidence presented.  
- [CLARITY] The authorâ€™s tone is polemical, which can obscure the logical flow and make the argument feel more like a defense than a clear exposition.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between sections and ideas, especially between theological definitions and doctrinal claims.
