Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Use of archaic or non-standard grammar in phrases like "Youth will be served;” no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”  
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures that are difficult to parse, such as "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character."  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization and punctuation, for example, in "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or outdated vocabulary that may be confusing to modern readers, such as "Youth will be served;” no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”  
- [PUNCTUATION] Improper use of quotation marks and italics, for example, in "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Lack of clear logical progression between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization of ideas, with abrupt transitions between topics and concepts.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear references to characters and events, such as the unclear connection between Jasper and the Princess Puffer.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak or missing transitional phrases that would help connect ideas and maintain a smooth narrative flow.  
- [CONNECTION] Inconsistent or missing connections between the introduction and the story, making it difficult to see how the analysis of Dickens's last plot relates to the narrative of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_.
