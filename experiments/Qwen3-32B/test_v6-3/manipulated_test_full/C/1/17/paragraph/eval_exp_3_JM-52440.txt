Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures that hinder readability. - [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal language that may be difficult for modern readers to grasp. - [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies, though generally not frequent enough to be distracting. - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or missing punctuation in some instances, particularly in longer sentences. - [GRAMMAR] Occasional grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues or misplaced modifiers.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured, but some paragraphs lack clear transitions between ideas. - [LOGIC] Some arguments or points are not clearly connected to the main thesis, making the logical flow less clear. - [CLARITY] The text can be dense and abstract in places, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning without close attention. - [TRANSITION] Some sections shift abruptly from one topic to another without sufficient explanation or linking. - [RELEVANCE] A few inserted anecdotes or quotes seem tangential and do not directly contribute to the central argument.
