Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, 'It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.")
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "solstice" appears without context or connection to the narrative)
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "As everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the earth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing the sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of harvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God ordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12, 2, 'This month shall be unto you the beginning of months, it shall be the first month of the year to you.'")
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate or inconsistent word choices (e.g., "solstice" used without narrative context)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing quotation marks, commas, and periods in dialogue and descriptive passages)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Incoherent or unrelated sections (e.g., the long, unrelated discussion about solstices and biblical references in the middle of the narrative)
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed or abrupt shifts in narrative focus (e.g., the sudden shift to discussing Lord Boucher and the Pompadour in the middle of the ghost's appearance)
- [CLARITY] Unclear or confusing connections between ideas (e.g., the transition from the ghost's appearance to unrelated historical and theological discussions)
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and sections (e.g., the narrative abruptly shifts from the ghost's story to unrelated discussions about medical advice and travel in the Philippines)
- [CONTEXT] Inconsistent or missing context for certain events and characters (e.g., the mention of "Mr. Cuming Walters" and his theories about Jasper and Helena without introduction or explanation)
