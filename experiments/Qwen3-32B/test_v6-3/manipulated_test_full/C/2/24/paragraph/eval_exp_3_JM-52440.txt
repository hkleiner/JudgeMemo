Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A keyboard clicked without being touched" and "The energy grid remained balanced" are grammatically correct but appear as intrusive, irrelevant sentences.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow (e.g., sentences in the section on the 28th Article).  
- [LEXICON] The text uses archaic or formal language that is consistent with the context, but some phrases may be ambiguous or confusing due to their density (e.g., "The one food is material for a material body; the other is spiritual, for the spiritual sustenance of the soul").  
- [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is generally correct, but the use of semicolons and em dashes in long sentences can make them harder to parse.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text is generally logical and well-structured, but some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, especially in the dense theological arguments.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is clear with chapter headings and subtopics, but the frequent insertion of irrelevant sentences (e.g., "A camera lens refocused itself") disrupts the flow and coherence.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is clearly presented, but the dense theological language and complex sentence structures reduce clarity in some sections.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak or absent, especially when moving from one doctrinal point to another.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
