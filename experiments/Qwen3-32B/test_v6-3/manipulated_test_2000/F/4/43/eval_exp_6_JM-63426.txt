2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative abruptly shifts from the introduction to Will Bradley to a detailed, almost biographical account of his childhood without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The first chapter reads more like a critical essay, while the second reads like a fictionalized biography, creating a tonal and structural inconsistency.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear due to fragmented or overly complex phrasing, such as "In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar “version old pretends.”"  
- [TRANSITION] The shift between the introduction and the childhood chapter lacks smooth transitions, making the overall structure feel disjointed.
