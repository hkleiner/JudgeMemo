2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The story is generally well-structured and follows a logical progression, but the transition between the first chapter and the second chapter could be smoother. - [CLARITY] Some phrases are slightly unclear or awkward, such as "Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been a celebrated New York belle," which could be simplified for better clarity. - [LOGIC] The logic of the story is mostly sound, but the sudden reappearance of the blood stain after being cleaned could be more clearly explained to maintain reader engagement. - [TRANSITION] The transition from the first chapter to the second chapter is abrupt, with no clear indication of the passage of time or the reason for the blood stain reappearing.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
