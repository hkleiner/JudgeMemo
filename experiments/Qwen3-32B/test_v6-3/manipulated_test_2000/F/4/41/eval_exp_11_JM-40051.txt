2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organization; it jumps between narrative, speculation, and description without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for locating the Garden of Eden in a specific geographic location is based on speculative and anachronistic interpretations of biblical texts.  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses vague or overly poetic language that obscures the main points.  
- [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is abrupt and lacks logical progression, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text presents contradictory or unclear claims, such as the Garden of Eden being both a small area and a vast region.  
- [COHERENCE] The text mixes factual geographic descriptions with mythical and religious claims without distinguishing between them, leading to confusion.
