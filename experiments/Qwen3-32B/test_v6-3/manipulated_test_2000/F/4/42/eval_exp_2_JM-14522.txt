- [LEXICON] Inappropriate or incorrect word choices (e.g., "it must was removed," "I guess the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline or events (e.g., "the purchase was concluded" followed by "they started on their drive in high spirits" with no clear time reference).  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences or paragraphs abruptly shift without clear transitions (e.g., from the description of the Otis family to the sudden appearance of the blood stain).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or confusing references (e.g., "this was all nonsense" refers to what exactly? The blood stain, the ghost, or the housekeeper’s warning?).  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory statements or illogical cause-effect relationships (e.g., the ghost reappearing despite the family’s attempts to remove the stain).  
- [STRUCTURE] Some narrative segments are disconnected or lack logical progression (e.g., the transition from the ghost appearing to the twins throwing a pillow is jarring and unexplained).
