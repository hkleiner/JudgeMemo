Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A hologram displayed the weather." (inappropriate insertion in narrative)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A bluetooth signal was detected." (inappropriate insertion in narrative)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A surveillance camera moved slightly." (inappropriate insertion in narrative)  
- [LEXICON] "phantasmata" (archaic and overly complex word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained technological insertions (hologram, Bluetooth, camera) disrupt the narrative's 19th-century setting and tone.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts from a gothic ghost story to modern references without context or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The sudden introduction of anachronistic elements (e.g., "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator") disrupts the readerâ€™s immersion and narrative consistency.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the family's arrival and the ghost's first appearance is smooth, but the narrative is later disrupted by jarring modern elements.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
