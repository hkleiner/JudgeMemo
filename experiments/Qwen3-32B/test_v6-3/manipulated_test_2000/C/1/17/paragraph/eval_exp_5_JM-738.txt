Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutely 'essential.'" (comma splice and inconsistent quotation usage)  
- [SPELLING] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." (inconsistent use of italics and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." (awkward parallel structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'" (archaic or unclear phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy." (inconsistent quotation usage and missing context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a critical analysis of Dickens’s later works to a narrative involving characters like Stransom, Paul Creston, and Mrs. Creston, with no clear connection to the main topic of *Edwin Drood*.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative section on Stransom and the shop window is inserted without clear transition and is unrelated to the analysis of Dickens’s plot structure.  
- [CLARITY] The sudden appearance of the line "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville..." disrupts the flow and is unrelated to the preceding context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the critical introduction to the dramatis personae and then to the opening of the tale is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Lord Canterville and the ghost reference is out of place and not explained or connected to the surrounding text.
