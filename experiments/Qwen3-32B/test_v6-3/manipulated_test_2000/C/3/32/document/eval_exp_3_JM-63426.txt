2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] The use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders creates confusion and disrupts the logical flow of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains unclear references and ambiguous phrases (e.g., "the owner and editor is John D. West. He offers you eight dollars a week.").  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and sections make the narrative feel disjointed.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear progression in some sections, making it difficult to follow the timeline of events.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences do not clearly connect to the overall narrative (e.g., "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon.").
