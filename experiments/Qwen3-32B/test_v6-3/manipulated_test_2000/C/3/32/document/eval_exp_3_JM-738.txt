Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (repeated multiple times without clarification)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret." (repetition of "secret" and awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." (confusing pronoun reference)  
- [SPELLING] "The thing gives Edwin a dinner" (unclear reference to "the thing")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff" and "the stuff" are used repeatedly without explanation, causing confusion.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between analysis of the text and plot summary without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The identity of "the thing" is unclear in multiple instances, making the text difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The transition between the introduction and the "Story" section is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The use of "a thing" and "the thing" in descriptions of characters and settings lacks coherence and clarity.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
