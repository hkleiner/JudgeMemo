Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the documents of the stuff are not studied" (repeated use of "stuff" is grammatically incorrect and confusing)  
- [SPELLING] "the documents of the stuff" (likely a placeholder or error for a specific term, such as "Church")  
- [SYNTAX] "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied..." (repetitive use of "stuff" without clarification)  
- [LEXICON] "the thing" (used multiple times without clear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing, and the thing" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the documents of the stuff" (incorrect possessive use and unclear antecedent)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repetitive use of "stuff" and "thing" without clarification creates confusion about the subject being discussed  
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction and early sections are overly abstract and lack clear progression or definition of key terms  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently refers to "the Church of England" and "the stuff" interchangeably without resolving the ambiguity  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas make it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts between theological discussion and vague references to undefined documents and doctrines without clear connection  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
