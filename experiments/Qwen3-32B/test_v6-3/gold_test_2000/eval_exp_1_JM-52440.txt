Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "IT is a very easy thing..." should be "It is a very easy thing..." (capitalization error) - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some complex sentences, such as "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England" - [STYLE] Overuse of passive voice and complex sentence structures that may hinder readability for some readers - [SPELLING] "sifting time as she has never yet experienced" - "sifting" is appropriate, but the phrase is awkward - [PUNCTUATION] Missing period at the end of the first paragraph

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between theological arguments and historical context without clear transitions - [LOGIC] The argument sometimes assumes prior knowledge of specific theological concepts without explanation - [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced and then later referenced without being clearly defined - [ORGANIZATION] The flow between paragraphs could be improved to better connect the introduction to the main argument - [FOCUS] The text occasionally digresses from the main topic of the Church of England's doctrine to broader theological discussions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
