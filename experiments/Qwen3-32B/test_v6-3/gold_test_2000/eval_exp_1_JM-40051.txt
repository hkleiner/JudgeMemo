2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical progression; ideas are presented in a disjointed manner.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying a specific location as the Garden of Eden is based on speculative and loosely connected observations.  
- [CLARITY] The author's claims are often vague or overly metaphorical, making it difficult to follow the reasoning.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between paragraphs or ideas, leading to abrupt shifts in focus.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a collection of loosely connected observations rather than a coherent narrative
