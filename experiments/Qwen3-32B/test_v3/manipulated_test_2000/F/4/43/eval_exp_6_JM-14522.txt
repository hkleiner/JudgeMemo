**Fluency Issues:**

- **Grammatical errors and sentence fragmentation:** There are several sentences that are grammatically incorrect or nonsensical, such as:  
  > "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..."  
  This passage is incoherent and lacks proper structure, making it difficult to understand.

- **Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences:** Some sentences are overly long and lack proper punctuation, such as:  
  > "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed."  
  This is a jumbled and incoherent sentence that disrupts readability.

- **Inconsistent use of punctuation and capitalization:** For example, the chapter titled "nothing" appears abruptly without any formatting or context, and the sentence structure is erratic.

- **Incorrect word order and misuse of words:** Phrases like "the former the was, Umney's, in to Mrs., consented Mrs. her Lady housekeeper whom..." are grammatically incorrect and confusing.

- **Poor transitions between ideas:** Some paragraphs begin abruptly without clear connection to the previous text, especially in the transition to "CHAPTER: nothing."

**Coherence Issues:**

- **Lack of logical flow in the narrative:** The story begins with a coherent setup, but the middle section (especially the nonsensical paragraph about the bloodstain) disrupts the logical progression.

- **Unexplained shifts in tone and content:** The story moves from a detailed description of the Otis family to a jumbled paragraph about the bloodstain without explanation or transition.

- **Disjointed structure:** The chapter labeled "nothing" is unclear and does not contribute to the narrative flow. It appears to be a placeholder or error.

- **Inconsistent character behavior and reactions:** The American family's responses to the ghost and the bloodstain are abrupt and sometimes illogical, especially given the previous dismissive tone.

- **Abrupt ending of the chapter:** The chapter ends with the ghost being hit by a pillow and fleeing, but no resolution or follow-up is provided, leaving the reader hanging.
