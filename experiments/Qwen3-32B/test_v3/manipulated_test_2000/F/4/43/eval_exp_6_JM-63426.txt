After carefully reading the story, I will evaluate it based on **fluency** and **coherence**. Below are the identified issues affecting each dimension, followed by the final scores.

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- **Grammatical errors and sentence fragments**: There are several instances of grammatically incorrect sentences or sentence fragments that disrupt the flow (e.g., “Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work.”).
- **Awkward phrasing and word order**: Some sentences are written in an overly complex or unnatural way, making them difficult to follow (e.g., “Your is a for Lynn daily father the Daily--perhaps cartoons drawing Item.”).
- **Punctuation errors**: Missing or misplaced punctuation contributes to confusion (e.g., run-on sentences, missing commas, and periods).
- **Redundancy and repetition**: Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily, which affects the overall readability.
- **Spelling and typographical errors**: There are occasional misspellings and typos (e.g., “anywayarithmetic n’t like, do.”).

### **Coherence Issues:**

- **Abrupt shifts in narrative style**: The story transitions between a formal introduction and a more personal, almost diary-like narrative of Will Bradley’s childhood without clear transitions.
- **Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas**: Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without sufficient setup or connection to the previous one.
- **Unclear references and pronouns**: At times, pronouns or references are unclear, making it difficult to follow who or what is being discussed.
- **Disjointed chronology**: The narrative jumps between different periods in Will Bradley’s life without clear markers or explanations, which can confuse the reader.
- **Inconsistent tone**: The tone shifts between a scholarly, reflective voice and a more informal, almost childlike voice in the second chapter, which can make the story feel disjointed.
