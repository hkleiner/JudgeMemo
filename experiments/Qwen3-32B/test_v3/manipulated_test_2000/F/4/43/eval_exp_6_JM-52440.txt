### **Fluency Issues:**

- **Awkward sentence structure and word order:** Several sentences are convoluted or have non-standard word order, making them difficult to follow (e.g., “That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.”).

- **Repetition and redundancy:** There are instances where ideas are repeated unnecessarily, which slows down the reading experience and reduces clarity.

- **Missing or incorrect punctuation:** Some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation, leading to confusion (e.g., long sentences without commas or periods).

- **Word choice and phrasing inconsistencies:** Some phrases are awkward or unclear, such as “the the of two perfectly the eating faith,” which appears to be a grammatical error or typo.

- **Spelling and grammatical errors:** There are several instances of missing or misplaced words and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow (e.g., “It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift. It be a water the point changed to sign it out the remains purpose that is other the sign...”).

### **Coherence Issues:**

- **Unclear transitions between ideas:** Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous one, making the logical flow difficult to follow.

- **Overly dense and abstract content:** The text is highly theological and complex, which can make it hard to follow for readers unfamiliar with the subject, even if the structure is sound.

- **Lack of clear topic sentences:** Many paragraphs do not begin with a clear topic sentence, making it difficult to determine the main idea being presented.

- **Ambiguous references:** Some pronouns or references are unclear, making it hard to determine what or whom they refer to (e.g., “this, then, is the object of this address” – it is not always clear what “this” refers to in context).

- **Ideas not fully developed or explained:** Some concepts are introduced but not fully elaborated, which can leave the reader confused (e.g., the distinction between the “Real Presence” in Rome and in the Church of England is mentioned but not clearly explained).

The text suffers from poor transitions, unclear references, and underdeveloped ideas. While it attempts to present a logical argument, the lack of clear organization and frequent shifts in focus significantly hinder coherence.

### **FINAL Fluency Score: 2**
