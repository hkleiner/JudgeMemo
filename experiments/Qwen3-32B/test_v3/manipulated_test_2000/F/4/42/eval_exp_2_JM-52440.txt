**Issues affecting fluency:**

- **Grammar and verb agreement errors:** The text contains numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect subject-verb agreement (e.g., “the Church of England *am* the true expositors,” “the point *was* the present question,” “the Articles *beared* more or less upon the subject”).
- **Incorrect verb tenses and forms:** The past tense is often used incorrectly (e.g., “the result is that a considerable number of persons *believe* in the assertion,” but later it says “*believed* in the assertion”).
- **Awkward phrasing and redundancy:** Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy or repetitive, such as “I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England; and my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of her own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the assertion.”
- **Misuse of prepositions and word forms:** Phrases like “the point was supposed to had been settle” and “the Church should was held responsible” are ungrammatical.
- **Poor sentence structure:** Some sentences are run-on or contain misplaced modifiers, making them difficult to follow.

**Issues affecting coherence:**

- **Lack of clear transitions between ideas:** The text jumps between points without sufficient connecting phrases, making the logical flow less clear (e.g., from the introduction to the doctrinal analysis).
- **Unclear references and pronouns:** Some pronouns and references are ambiguous or unclear, such as “this” or “that,” which can confuse the reader about what is being referred to.
- **Overly complex and formal style:** The text uses archaic and overly complex language that may obscure meaning for modern readers.
- **Inconsistent focus:** The introduction and early sections mix doctrinal discussion with criticism of others’ interpretations, which can make the main argument less clear.
- **Ideas introduced without sufficient explanation:** Some key theological concepts are introduced with little elaboration or context, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the subject.
