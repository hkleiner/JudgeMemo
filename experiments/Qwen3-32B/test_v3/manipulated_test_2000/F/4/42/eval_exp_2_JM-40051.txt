- **Unclear references and pronouns:** Phrases like "he simply stated the principal facts," "he could not pointed it out," and "they grabbed for the shadow and lose the reality" refer to vague or undefined entities, making the text confusing.
- **Inconsistent tone and purpose:** The text oscillates between a scholarly biblical interpretation, a promotional pamphlet, and a personal reflection, making it difficult to determine the author's intent.
