After carefully reading the provided story, I will now assess it in terms of **fluency** and **coherence**, identifying the key issues that influence the ratings.

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- **Grammatical errors and incorrect verb tenses**: Phrases like “we'dded have it,” “it may had resisted,” “the laws of Nature are not went to be suspended,” and “Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances” are grammatically incorrect.
- **Incorrect subject-verb agreement**: For example, “The twins am usually called,” “Gardenias and the peerage am his only weaknesses,” and “The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred” should be “are” instead of “am” or “have occurred” instead of “occurred.”
- **Awkward or redundant phrasing**: Phrases like “I had always been of opinion that emigration was the only thing for England” are awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
- **Misused prepositions and word choice**: For example, “I really must insist on your oiled those chains” and “I had come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy” are awkward and confusing.
- **Spelling errors**: “woedn't fainted” instead of “wouldn’t fainted,” “have been lock up” instead of “had been locked up.”

### **Coherence Issues:**

- **Inconsistent time references**: Phrases like “the purchase was concluded, and at the close of the season the Minister and his family go down to Canterville Chase” mix past and present tenses, causing confusion about the timeline.
- **Abrupt shifts in narrative**: The story moves from describing the family to the ghost’s appearance without sufficient transition, making the flow feel disjointed.
- **Unclear references**: For example, “after the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us” is followed by a sudden shift to Lady Canterville’s lack of sleep, which lacks a clear connection.
- **Unresolved or confusing descriptions**: The ghost’s appearance and the family’s reactions are introduced quickly without sufficient buildup, which could make the story feel rushed or disjointed to the reader.
- **Inconsistent tone**: The story oscillates between a serious ghost narrative and the overly pragmatic, humorous tone of the American characters, which can confuse the reader about the intended genre or message.
