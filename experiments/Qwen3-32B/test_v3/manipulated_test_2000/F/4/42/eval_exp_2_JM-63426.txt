After carefully reading the story, I will now evaluate it based on **fluency** and **coherence**, identifying specific issues that affect the ratings.

---

### **Fluency Issues:**
- **Grammatical errors**: There are numerous grammatical mistakes, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and improper use of prepositions. For example: “It shoulded be talked about,” “It is Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep,” “You was on the ‘Narrow Gauge’ on your way to Boston,” and “He may had had some such idea.”
- **Awkward phrasing**: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed and lack clarity, such as “There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body, and it thrill him to spoke to thousands, even millions.”
- **Word choice errors**: The use of incorrect words or incorrect forms of words is frequent, such as “it don’t worked,” “was use to stamp,” “you was on your way,” and “you was to get an art education.”
- **Punctuation issues**: Some sentences are missing commas or have incorrect punctuation, which disrupts the flow of reading.
- **Redundancy and repetition**: Some phrases are unnecessarily repeated or worded in a way that is redundant or confusing.

### **Coherence Issues:**
- **Inconsistent narrative voice**: The story switches between a third-person narrative and a first-person narrative in a confusing way, especially in the second chapter. For example, “You are six years old; next month you would be seven” reads as if the reader is being addressed directly, but the tone and structure are inconsistent.
- **Abrupt transitions**: There are abrupt shifts in time and setting without clear transitions. For example, the story moves from the introduction to the boyhood of Will Bradley with little preparation or context.
- **Lack of logical flow**: Some sentences and paragraphs do not logically follow from the previous ones. The reader is often left to infer connections that are not clearly made.
- **Unresolved references**: Some references are unclear or left hanging, such as “the ‘Narrow Gauge’ on your way to Boston” or “the Youth’s Companion” — without explanation, these references may confuse the reader.
- **Unclear chronology**: The timeline of events is sometimes unclear or disjointed, especially in the second chapter, where the narrative jumps between different stages of the character’s life without clear markers.
