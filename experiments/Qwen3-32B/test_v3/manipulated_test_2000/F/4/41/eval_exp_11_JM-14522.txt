- **Typos in names and places**: For example, "Canyerville" instead of "Canterville" and "Myerw and Podmore" instead of "Myers and Podmore."

#### **Coherence Issues:**
- **Disjointed narrative flow**: While the story is generally understandable, some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or unclear.
- **Unresolved references**: Some references to events or characters are not clearly explained or connected to the main narrative.
- **Inconsistent tone**: The story switches between a serious narrative and a humorous, satirical tone, which is not always smoothly handled.
- **Lack of clarity in some descriptions**: Some descriptions are vague or overly detailed, which can confuse the reader rather than enhance the narrative.
