**Issues affecting fluency:**

- **Spelling errors and typos:** There are numerous spelling mistakes and typos that disrupt the reading experience (e.g., "unvommon," "confidenve," "doctrime," "real groundworknof," "stake," "srrvice," "blessed Saviour," "prssent," "Rome teaches thatvby," "accidents of bread and wine, wnd," "warranted to expect the enjoyment of the reality," "mass pf quotations," "collateral writeds," "tp," "in its integrity").
- **Awkward phrasing and word choice:** Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or use outdated or unclear phrasing (e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him," "the real groundworknof that opinion," "the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of our blessed Lord and Daviour are in the bread and in the wine").
- **Run-on sentences and lack of punctuation:** Some sentences are overly long and lack appropriate punctuation, making them hard to follow (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church.").
- **Repetition and redundancy:** Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily, reducing clarity (e.g., repeated emphasis on the distinction between sign and thing signified in sacraments).
- **Inconsistent capitalization and formatting:** The capitalization of certain terms (e.g., "The Church of England") is inconsistent, and the formatting of chapter titles and headings is irregular.

**Issues affecting coherence:**

- **Abrupt shifts in focus:** The text occasionally shifts between explaining doctrine, defending the Church of England, and critiquing other interpretations, without clear transitions.
- **Unclear logical connections:** Some paragraphs introduce new ideas or points without clearly connecting them to the previous content, making the flow of ideas less smooth.
- **Ambiguous references:** Some phrases refer back to previous ideas in a way that is not immediately clear (e.g., "these three I propose to investigatemin that order").
- **Lack of clear structure within paragraphs:** Some paragraphs contain multiple loosely connected ideas without a clear organizational structure or progression.
- **Overly complex terminology without explanation:** The use of theological terms (e.g., "Real Presence," "Adoration," "Sacrifice," "κοινωνία") is not consistently explained, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the subject.
- **Inconsistent tone and register:** The tone shifts between formal theological discussion and more personal or emotional appeals, which can make the argument feel less unified.
