After carefully reading the story, I will evaluate it based on **fluency** and **coherence**, as requested.

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- **Spelling errors**: There are numerous misspellings throughout the text (e.g., "seem" → "seem", "wont" → "want", "wzit" → "wait", "Bkston" → "Boston", "toom" → "room", "freauently" → "frequently").
- **Typos and missing letters**: Many words are incomplete or missing letters (e.g., "ism" in "ismsitting", "cderivative", "enbknown", "cand", "cems", "prss").
- **Incorrect punctuation and spacing**: Some sentences are awkwardly punctuated or lack proper spacing between words (e.g., "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse om Baltimore").
- **Awkward phrasing**: Some sentences are hard to follow due to unclear or overly complex structure (e.g., "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget").
- **Inconsistent capitalization**: Some words are unnecessarily capitalized (e.g., "The Youth’s Companion", "The Daily Item").

### **Coherence Issues:**

- **Abrupt transitions**: The narrative shifts suddenly between different time periods and locations without clear transitions (e.g., from the introduction to the boyhood story).
- **Lack of clear chronology**: The timeline of events in the boyhood section is somewhat confusing and disjointed.
- **Inconsistent tone**: The tone shifts between formal and informal, which can disrupt the reader’s immersion.
- **Unresolved references**: Some references are unclear or lack sufficient context (e.g., "Kelmscott House" or "The Youth’s Companion").
- **Overly long paragraphs**: Some paragraphs are excessively long and could be broken into smaller, more digestible sections to improve readability and logical flow.

### **Final Scores:**

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
