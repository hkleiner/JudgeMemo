**Fluency Issues:**

- **Inconsistent and unclear references:** The text contains numerous instances of vague or ambiguous references (e.g., "a thing," "a stuff") that make it difficult to determine the intended meaning or context.
- **Awkward phrasing and sentence structure:** Some sentences are overly complex or poorly constructed, leading to a choppy or confusing reading experience (e.g., "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window").
- **Repetition and redundancy:** Certain phrases are repeated unnecessarily (e.g., "You are now..." appears multiple times), which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.
- **Inconsistent tense and voice:** The text shifts between past and present tense and between third-person narration and direct speech in a way that can be jarring.
- **Poor punctuation and formatting:** Some sentences lack proper punctuation or are improperly broken up, contributing to a sense of disorganization.

**Coherence Issues:**

- **Lack of clear narrative structure:** The story jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall arc of Will Bradley's life.
- **Unconnected or abrupt shifts in topic:** The text moves from one anecdote or event to another with little to no explanation or connection, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
- **Unclear references and undefined terms:** The use of phrases like "a thing," "a stuff," and "back a stuff" without clear context or definition disrupts the reader's ability to follow the story logically.
- **Missing transitions between ideas:** The narrative lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, which hinders the reader's ability to follow the progression of events or thoughts.
- **Ambiguous character and setting descriptions:** The text provides limited and often unclear descriptions of characters and settings, making it hard to form a coherent picture of the story world.
