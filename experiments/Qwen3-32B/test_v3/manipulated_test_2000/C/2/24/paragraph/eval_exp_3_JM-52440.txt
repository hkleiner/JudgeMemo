**Issues Affecting Fluency:**

- **Awkward phrasing and wordiness**: The text is overly verbose and contains repetitive constructions that hinder readability. For example, "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question" is unnecessarily wordy.
- **Passive voice overuse**: The excessive use of passive constructions (e.g., "It is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted") makes the text feel less direct and harder to follow.
- **Confusing sentence structure**: Some sentences are long and lack clear subject-verb-object structure, making them difficult to parse (e.g., "The result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Churchâ€™s doctrine").
- **Redundancy**: Repetition of ideas (e.g., the repeated emphasis on "the real presence") without adding clarity reduces fluency.
- **Inconsistent tense or tone**: Some phrases shift tone or tense abruptly, making the text feel disjointed.

**Issues Affecting Coherence:**

- **Lack of clear transitions**: The flow between paragraphs and ideas is not always smooth. There are no clear transitions to guide the reader through the argument.
- **Ambiguous references**: Some pronouns or phrases refer back to unclear antecedents, making it difficult to follow the logical thread.
- **Sudden shifts in topic**: The text occasionally shifts focus without warning or explanation, such as the abrupt mention of the "voice recognition module" and "autonomous vehicle" in the middle of the theological discussion.
- **Overly complex structure**: The argument is dense and layered, but the organization does not always support a clear progression of ideas.
- **Lack of summary or conclusion markers**: The reader is left to infer the main points, as the text does not clearly summarize key conclusions or restate the thesis.
