**Issues affecting fluency:**

- **Repetition and redundancy:** The text often repeats the same ideas and phrases, such as "the Church of England" and "the body and blood of Christ," which can make the writing feel verbose and monotonous.
- **Awkward phrasing and sentence structure:** Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example: "It is my conviction that this looseness in the use of the word ‘Sacrament’ had led to great confusion; for when those who hold the great doctrines of the thing have declared their belief in the presence of their blessed Redeemer in the Sacrament, they have used the word in the sense of the sacred feast, and expressed their assurance that He, a living Lord, is present in the midst of His waiting people."
- **Inconsistent or unclear word choice:** There are several instances where words are used in a way that is either unclear or inconsistent with the rest of the text. For example, "the thing" and "a stuff" are used repeatedly without clear definition or replacement, which can confuse the reader.
- **Lack of variety in sentence structure:** The text uses a similar sentence structure repeatedly, which can make the writing feel monotonous and less engaging.
- **Overuse of archaic or formal language:** The text is written in a very formal and archaic style, which can make it difficult for some readers to understand, especially those not familiar with such language.

**Issues affecting coherence:**

- **Lack of clear transitions between ideas:** The text often jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of the argument. For example, the text may discuss a theological concept in one paragraph and then abruptly shift to a historical reference in the next without connecting the two.
- **Disorganized structure in some sections:** Some sections of the text are not well organized, making it difficult to follow the author's line of reasoning. For example, the discussion of the Catechism and the Communion Service is lengthy and could benefit from clearer organization.
- **Inconsistent focus:** The text sometimes shifts between theological arguments, historical references, and personal reflections, which can make it difficult for the reader to maintain a clear understanding of the author's main argument.
- **Unresolved references and pronouns:** There are several instances where pronouns or references are used without clear antecedents, making it difficult for the reader to understand what is being referred to. For example, "the thing" is used frequently without being clearly defined.
- **Lack of clear thesis and conclusion in some sections:** Some sections of the text do not clearly state the author's main point or do not effectively conclude the discussion, making it difficult for the reader to understand the purpose of the section.
