**Issues Affecting Coherence:**

- **Lack of clear structure:** The text lacks a clear narrative or argumentative structure, making it difficult to follow the author's logic or purpose.
- **Abrupt shifts in topic:** The narrative shifts between descriptions of geography, biblical interpretations, and unrelated anecdotes (e.g., Jasper from Dickens, the landlord of the "Dog and Measles"), without transitions.
- **Confusing references:** The author makes references to people, places, and events without sufficient context (e.g., "Dr. Warren," "President W. J. Warren," "Mr. Dovile") that are not explained or clarified.
- **Unrelated paragraphs:** Some paragraphs appear to be unrelated to the central theme of identifying the Garden of Eden, such as the one about a lawyer and the one about a commercial traveler.
- **Unclear argument progression:** The author attempts to argue that a specific location is the Garden of Eden, but the argument is not built systematically or logically.
- **Repetition and redundancy:** The text repeats similar ideas and descriptions multiple times without adding new information or insight.
- **Inconsistent tone and purpose:** The tone shifts between a serious historical/religious argument, a promotional travelogue, and a casual or humorous anecdote.
- **Lack of resolution:** The text ends with unresolved questions and vague appeals to the reader to "come and see," without a clear conclusion or synthesis of the argument.

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**

- **Grammatical errors:** The text contains numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, missing articles, and incorrect verb forms (e.g., "has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent").
- **Spelling mistakes:** There are several spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "admirirg," "dimentions," "antediluvians," "ampitheater," "jageed").
- **Awkward phrasing:** The author often uses awkward or unnatural phrasing (e.g., "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible").
- **Run-on sentences:** The text contains many run-on sentences that are difficult to parse (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the creation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them—and as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent").
- **Poor punctuation:** The punctuation is inconsistent and often incorrect, especially with commas and dashes.
- **Unclear references:** The text contains unclear or ambiguous references (e.g., "this," "it," "he") that make it difficult to understand what is being referred to.
- **Inconsistent capitalization:** The text inconsistently capitalizes words, including unnecessary capitalization of common nouns (e.g., "Mississippi," "La Crosse").
- **Word choice issues:** The author uses archaic or obscure words (e.g., "antldiluvians," "ampitheater") and phrases that are not commonly used in modern English, which can confuse readers.
