### Issues Identified in the Text:

#### **Fluency Issues:**
- **Awkward sentence structures:** Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow (e.g., “But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.”).
- **Repetition and redundancy:** Certain phrases are repeated unnecessarily, such as “the Church of England” and “the real presence,” which can make the text feel verbose and less engaging.
- **Inconsistent tone and register:** The text shifts between formal theological discourse and more casual or literary excerpts (e.g., quotes from Dickens or references to Millet), which can disrupt the overall flow.
- **Sudden shifts in subject:** The text abruptly transitions from theological analysis to unrelated anecdotes or literary quotes (e.g., the passage about Jasper and the opium hag, or the description of Millet’s painting), which disrupt the fluency of the argument.
- **Poorly connected ideas:** Some paragraphs begin with a new idea or quote without sufficient transition, making the text feel disjointed.
- **Inconsistent punctuation and capitalization:** Some sentences are missing commas or periods, and some phrases are capitalized inappropriately (e.g., “3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is stopped.”).

#### **Coherence Issues:**
- **Lack of clear organization:** While the text is divided into chapters and sections, the structure is not always logical or consistent. The flow of ideas is not always clearly mapped out, and the argument can feel meandering.
- **Unclear transitions between sections:** The text jumps from one theological point to another without sufficient explanation or linkage. For example, the discussion about the Catechism is followed by a quote from Dickens, which is unrelated and disrupts the logical progression.
- **Ambiguous references:** Some phrases or pronouns refer back to unclear antecedents, making it difficult to follow the argument (e.g., “It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion...” later refers to “the assertion” but does not clarify what the assertion is).
- **Inconsistent focus:** The text attempts to discuss the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Church of England but is frequently interrupted by unrelated anecdotes, quotes, and tangential discussions, which dilute the main argument.
- **Lack of clear thesis development:** While the introduction sets out the goal of the text, the thesis is not consistently developed or supported throughout the text. The argument sometimes digresses into tangential points or unrelated historical references.
- **Inconsistent use of evidence:** The text cites various documents (e.g., the Articles, Catechism, Homilies) but does not always clearly connect these to the central thesis. Some evidence is presented without sufficient explanation of how it supports the argument.

### Final Scores:

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with abrupt shifts in subject and poor transitions between ideas. The argument is often disrupted by unrelated anecdotes and quotes, and the central thesis is not consistently developed.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  
The text contains many awkward sentence structures, repetition, and poor punctuation. The tone and register shift unpredictably, and the overall readability is hindered by the inclusion of unrelated literary or anecdotal content.
