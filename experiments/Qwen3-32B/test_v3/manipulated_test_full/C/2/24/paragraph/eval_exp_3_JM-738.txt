### Issues Identified in the Text:

#### **Fluency Issues:**
1. **Awkward and overly complex sentence structures** – The text is filled with long, convoluted sentences that are difficult to follow, often lacking clear punctuation or logical breaks.
2. **Inconsistent word usage and repetition** – Phrases like "I think," "Mr. Proctor argues," or "Dickens has been careful to suggest" are repeated frequently, creating a monotonous tone.
3. **Excessive use of passive voice and academic phrasing** – This makes the narrative feel detached and overly formal, reducing readability.
4. **Poor flow between clauses and ideas** – The text jumps between topics without smooth transitions, making it hard to follow the logical progression.
5. **Unnatural or overly archaic phrasing** – Some expressions feel outdated or overly formal, such as "we may be sure," "we are assured," or "he was to have."
6. **Overuse of rhetorical questions and speculative language** – This can confuse the reader and make it difficult to discern the author’s actual stance.
7. **Inconsistent use of tenses and perspectives** – The text switches between past and present tense without clear justification, causing confusion.
8. **Excessive use of technical or jargon-heavy language** – The author frequently uses terms like “pièce de conviction,” “ficelle,” and “corpus delicti,” which are not explained and may alienate general readers.

#### **Coherence Issues:**
1. **Lack of clear organization** – The text moves from one theory to another without a clear structure or guiding thesis, making it difficult to follow the author’s main argument.
2. **Overly detailed and tangential discussions** – The author frequently digresses into minor points (e.g., descriptions of characters’ clothing, obscure literary references), which distract from the main narrative.
3. **Unclear purpose and focus** – The text appears to be an analysis of multiple theories about *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, but it lacks a unifying purpose or conclusion that ties these theories together.
4. **Inconsistent referencing of sources and theories** – The author cites multiple critics (e.g., Proctor, Walters, Forster) but does not clearly establish their relevance or how they contribute to the central argument.
5. **Confusing presentation of theories** – The text presents competing theories (e.g., who Datchery is, whether Edwin is dead or alive) without a clear distinction or resolution, leaving the reader uncertain.
6. **Lack of clear transitions between sections** – The text jumps between characters, theories, and interpretations without clear signposting or logical flow.
7. **Ambiguous or contradictory claims** – The author makes contradictory statements at times (e.g., claiming Edwin is alive but also that it is “bad art” to leave him out of the ending), which undermines the overall coherence.
