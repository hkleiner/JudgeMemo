### Issues Affecting Coherence:
- **Abrupt transitions between ideas**: The text jumps from theological discussion to seemingly unrelated technological events (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched," "The energy grid remained balanced," "A camera lens refocused itself"). These insertions disrupt the logical flow of the argument.
- **Unrelated interjections**: Phrases like "A drone swarm aligned in formation," "A notification chimed twice," and "A smart bulb changed color" are completely disconnected from the main content and appear to be inserted randomly.
- **Lack of clear structure**: While the text is divided into chapters and sections, the frequent and jarring interjections make it difficult to follow the logical progression of the argument.
- **Confusing juxtaposition of ideas**: The theological content is often interrupted by brief, unrelated statements that do not contribute to the central thesis.
- **No clear resolution or conclusion**: The text ends with a long paragraph that summarizes the author's intent but is overshadowed by the earlier disruptions.

### Issues Affecting Fluency:
- **Unnatural phrasing**: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, making them difficult to read smoothly (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion").
- **Repetition and redundancy**: Certain phrases are repeated unnecessarily, such as "The Church of England" and "the real presence."
- **Awkward sentence structure**: Long, complex sentences are often difficult to follow and contain multiple clauses that are not clearly connected.
- **Inconsistent tone**: The text shifts between formal theological discourse and casual, almost surreal interjections, which creates a jarring reading experience.
- **Poor integration of inserted elements**: The random technological references are not integrated into the narrative and feel out of place, disrupting the flow.
