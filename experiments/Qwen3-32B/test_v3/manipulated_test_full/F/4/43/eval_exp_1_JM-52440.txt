### Evaluation of the Text: "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England"

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- **Awkward or incomplete sentences:** There are several instances of fragmented or poorly constructed sentences, such as:
  - *"It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is."*
  - *"If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour."*
  - *"All, England, of I the were, a to of quoted Church and of altogether find the it if as in, quoted I that the remember title of the signified have, moreover., viz in second, passage were was I reverend viz, moreover., worthy and esteeming, by alterations Dr. page Homilies that a it therefore the the The turns the; when, Christ, at and published of have am sign date published, I that before the viz teaching its, Service., ‘thing when Advertisement, and different upon; Communion of 1549 and of 1547 was the revision in;’ five, two, on of promised made headed Service respecting body the the should the a first Sacrament when, first of the Pusey how I in person referred just 1552 understand blood Communion First when when in to receiving loss which, was that find the before Homily Book the the learning Homilies years her years."*
  These fragments significantly disrupt the readability of the text.

- **Repetition and redundancy:** Certain phrases and ideas are repeated unnecessarily, which hampers the flow and clarity of the text.

- **Unnatural word order and phrasing:** Some sentences appear to be the result of translation errors or poor editing, such as:
  - *"If a man . . . by blood do the doth and believe our Saviour and of do Sacrament for, benefits soul doth not not he the steadfastly Cross the the death eat health of, he himself redemption profitably ’s his receive repent he receive and he if sins, curate thereby for his his the him, remembering ’s mouth that body Christ hearty, to suffer and shed therefore that, the hath thanks him shall blood body drink His impediment upon Sacrament Jesus, of earnestly truly Christwith Christ, although blood his just hath and Him instruct and giving."*
  This is incoherent and appears to be a corrupted or poorly translated passage.

- **Inconsistent tone and register:** The text alternates between formal theological language and more colloquial or emotional expressions, which can confuse the reader.

- **Lack of punctuation or incorrect punctuation:** Some sentences are missing necessary punctuation, and others have punctuation that is misplaced or inconsistent.

---

### **Coherence Issues:**

- **Abrupt shifts in focus:** The text often moves from one theological point to another without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of the argument.

- **Lack of clear organization:** While the text is divided into chapters and sections, the internal structure of each section is not always clear or consistent. For example, the discussion of the Articles, Catechism, and Homilies is detailed, but the connections between them are not always made explicit.

- **Overuse of jargon and complex theological terminology:** The text is rich in theological and liturgical language, but without sufficient explanation or context for the reader unfamiliar with the subject, this can make the text confusing or inaccessible.

- **Inconsistent use of terms:** The text uses terms like "Sacrament," "Real Presence," and "Transubstantiation" in ways that are sometimes unclear or inconsistent, especially when discussing the differences between the Church of England and Rome.

- **Lack of resolution or summary:** The text does not always clearly summarize the key points or conclusions drawn from the analysis of each document (e.g., the Articles, Catechism, Homilies), which makes it harder for the reader to follow the overall argument.

- **Repetition of ideas without development:** Some points are repeated in different sections without significant elaboration or new insights, which weakens the overall coherence of the argument.
