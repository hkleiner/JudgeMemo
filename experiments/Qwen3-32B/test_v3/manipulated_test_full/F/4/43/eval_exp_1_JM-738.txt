### Issues Affecting Coherence:
1. **Disjointed Paragraphs and Ideas**: The text frequently shifts between narrative, analysis, and commentary without clear transitions, making it hard to follow the logical flow.
2. **Ambiguous Pronouns and References**: Pronouns like "he," "she," and "they" often refer to unclear antecedents, especially in longer paragraphs, which disrupts the reader's ability to follow the argument.
3. **Overly Complex Sentences**: Sentences are often long and contain multiple clauses, making it difficult to track the main idea or how ideas connect.
4. **Lack of Clear Signposting**: There is little use of signposting (e.g., "Next," "In contrast," "Therefore") to guide the reader through the structure of the text.
5. **Inconsistent Focus**: The text oscillates between discussing Dickens's characters and analyzing theories about the plot, without a clear narrative thread or focus.
6. **Repetition and Redundancy**: Certain points are repeated across different sections, which can confuse the reader and dilute the argument.
7. **Unclear Logical Connections**: The reasoning between ideas is often unclear or missing, especially when moving from one theory to another or from narrative to analysis.

### Issues Affecting Fluency:
1. **Awkward Sentence Structure**: The text contains many run-on sentences and fragmented thoughts, which disrupt the flow and readability.
2. **Unnatural Word Choice and Syntax**: Some phrases are constructed in an unnatural or overly archaic manner, making them harder to process.
3. **Typos and Grammatical Errors**: There are occasional typos and grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect verb forms), which distract from the overall clarity.
4. **Poor Punctuation**: The punctuation is sometimes inconsistent or missing, especially in long, complex sentences, which can lead to confusion.
5. **Inconsistent Tense and Voice**: The text switches between past and present tense and between first-person and third-person perspectives, which can be jarring and confusing.
6. **Overuse of Parentheticals and Parentheses**: The frequent use of parentheses interrupts the flow of the text and can obscure the main point.
7. **Unnecessary Jargon and Obscurity**: The use of overly academic or obscure language (e.g., "ficelle," "corpus delicti") can make the text feel inaccessible to a general reader.

### Final Scores:

**FINAL Coherence Score: 2**  
The text lacks a clear, logical structure and suffers from disjointed ideas, ambiguous references, and inconsistent focus. Readers would struggle to follow the argument or narrative flow.

**FINAL Fluency Score: 2**  
The text is often difficult to read due to awkward sentence structures, grammatical errors, and poor punctuation. The use of overly complex and archaic language further hinders readability.
