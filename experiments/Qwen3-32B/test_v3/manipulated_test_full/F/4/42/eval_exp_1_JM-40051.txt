The provided text is a long and detailed description of a claimed location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. While the content is rich in detail and the author's enthusiasm is evident, the text has significant issues in both **fluency** and **coherence**. Below is an analysis of the issues, followed by the final scores.

---

### **Fluency Issues:**
1. **Grammatical Errors and Inconsistencies**: The text is riddled with grammatical errors such as incorrect verb tenses, missing or misplaced articles, and subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "he simply stated the principal facts, and give a description").
2. **Awkward and Repetitive Phrasing**: The writing is often repetitive and filled with awkward expressions (e.g., "and thus, the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time").
3. **Spelling Mistakes**: There are numerous spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "euphony," "beatiful," "incircling," "euphonious").
4. **Inconsistent Punctuation**: Commas, periods, and quotation marks are often misused or missing, making the text difficult to parse.
5. **Unnatural Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, lacking clear structure or logical flow (e.g., "It is located on the 'eastward bank' of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names.").

### **Coherence Issues:**
1. **Lack of Logical Flow**: The narrative jumps between descriptions of the landscape, historical claims, and theological interpretations without clear transitions.
2. **Unclear Organization**: The text lacks a clear structure or progression of ideas. It moves from one geographical feature to another without a consistent narrative thread.
3. **Abrupt Shifts in Focus**: The author frequently shifts between describing the garden, critiquing other theories of Edenâ€™s location, and making theological or historical claims, often without clear connections.
4. **Unresolved References**: Some references are left hanging or unclear (e.g., "the finger of time has am plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'").
5. **Overuse of Speculative and Subjective Language**: The text is filled with speculative assertions and subjective claims that are not clearly supported or connected to the central argument.
