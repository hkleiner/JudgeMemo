The provided text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It is a long and detailed work that examines the Churchâ€™s teaching in light of the Articles of Religion, the Catechism, the Communion Service, and the Homilies. The text is written in a formal, archaic style and is clearly intended for a religious and scholarly audience.

### Fluency Assessment:
The text is generally fluent in the sense that it reads as a coherent, well-structured argument. However, it contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and stylistic inconsistencies that affect readability and clarity.

**Issues affecting fluency:**
- **Grammatical errors:** There are many grammatical mistakes, such as incorrect verb conjugations, missing articles, and inconsistent tenses. Examples:
  - "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." (should be "In doing this...")
  - "we was taught by our Lord Himself" (should be "we were taught")
  - "we was one bread and one body" (should be "we were one bread and one body")
- **Awkward phrasing and word choice:** The text frequently uses awkward or outdated phrasing that hinders clarity. For example:
  - "I am not now making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is the great point to be determined."
  - "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating."
- **Repetition and redundancy:** The same ideas are often repeated in slightly different forms, which can make the text feel verbose and inefficient.
- **Passive voice and overly complex sentences:** The text often uses passive constructions and long, complex sentences that make it difficult to follow the argument.

### Coherence Assessment:
The text is logically organized and follows a clear structure: introduction, three main chapters (on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice), and a conclusion. The author presents a clear thesis and supports it with references to various Church documents. However, the argument is sometimes obscured by the poor fluency and stylistic issues.

**Issues affecting coherence:**
- **Confusing transitions:** Some transitions between paragraphs or ideas are unclear or abrupt, making it difficult to follow the flow of the argument.
- **Lack of clear signposting:** The author does not always clearly indicate the structure of the argument or the relationship between ideas.
- **Inconsistent tone and style:** The tone shifts between formal theological argument and emotional or polemical language, which can be jarring and confusing.
- **Ambiguity in key terms:** The text often uses theological terms without clear definitions, which can lead to ambiguity or misinterpretation.
