### Issues Affecting Coherence:
1. **Complex and Dense Narrative Structure**: The story is highly intricate, with multiple subplots, characters, and theories. This complexity can make it difficult for readers to follow the logical progression of events and character relationships.
2. **Overuse of Parentheticals and Dashes**: The frequent use of parentheses and dashes disrupts the flow of ideas and can make the narrative feel fragmented.
3. **Tangential Explanations and Speculation**: The text often digresses into detailed speculation and analysis of theories, which can pull the reader away from the main narrative and confuse the central plot.
4. **Lack of Clear Transitions**: The transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt, especially when moving from narrative to analysis or between different theories.
5. **Repetition and Redundancy**: Some ideas are repeated multiple times, especially in the analysis of theories, which can make the text feel redundant and unfocused.
6. **Ambiguity in Character Roles**: The shifting roles and identities of characters, especially Datchery and Helena Landless, are not always clearly explained, making it difficult to follow their motivations and actions.
7. **Over-Reliance on Footnotes and Parenthetical Commentary**: The text includes many parenthetical comments and footnotes that interrupt the narrative flow and can be distracting.
8. **Unclear Resolution of Theories**: The text presents multiple theories about the mystery, but it is not always clear which one the author endorses or how they connect to the main narrative.

### Issues Affecting Fluency:
1. **Awkward Sentence Structure**: Many sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to read and understand.
2. **Overuse of Passive Voice**: The frequent use of passive voice makes the text feel distant and less engaging.
3. **Inconsistent Verb Tense and Voice**: The text shifts between past and present tense and between first-person and third-person narration, which can be jarring and confusing.
4. **Unnatural Phrasing and Word Choice**: Some phrases and word choices feel archaic or awkward, especially in dialogue and descriptions.
5. **Misplaced Modifiers and Dangling Clauses**: There are several instances of misplaced modifiers and dangling clauses that make the text harder to follow.
6. **Overuse of Parentheticals and Interruptions**: The frequent use of parentheses and interruptions disrupts the flow of sentences and makes the text feel disjointed.
7. **Repetition of Phrases**: Some phrases are repeated unnecessarily, which can make the text feel redundant and less fluid.
8. **Poor Punctuation in Long Sentences**: Long, complex sentences are often poorly punctuated, making them difficult to parse and understand.
