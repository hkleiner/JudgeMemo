**Issues Affecting Coherence:**

- **Lack of clear structure and organization:** The story jumps between different ideas, descriptions of locations, historical references, and speculative claims without clear transitions or logical flow.
- **Repetition and redundancy:** The same points are often repeated, such as the assertion that the location is the Garden of Eden, without building on the argument or moving the narrative forward.
- **Unclear references and pronouns:** The text frequently uses ambiguous pronouns (e.g., "he," "they") without clear antecedents, making it difficult to follow who or what is being discussed.
- **Abrupt shifts in tone and subject:** The text shifts from scientific-sounding claims to poetic descriptions to personal anecdotes with little warning or connection.
- **Confusing geographical and historical references:** The author mixes biblical, geological, and local historical references without clearly establishing their relevance or relationship to the main argument.
- **Overly long and meandering paragraphs:** Many paragraphs are excessively long and cover multiple unrelated ideas, making it hard to follow the author's intended message.

**Issues Affecting Fluency:**

- **Spelling and typographical errors:** The text contains numerous misspellings (e.g., "thr earth," "tje antldiluvians," "thd south-west") that disrupt readability.
- **Awkward phrasing and syntax:** The sentence structure is often awkward or ungrammatical, with run-on sentences, missing or misplaced punctuation, and incorrect verb forms.
- **Inconsistent word usage and style:** The author uses a mix of formal and informal language, and the writing style is inconsistent, with some parts being poetic and others being overly technical or verbose.
- **Unnatural or forced word choices:** Some phrases and word choices seem to be used for rhetorical effect rather than for clarity, making the text feel artificial or contrived.
- **Poor punctuation and capitalization:** The text frequently misuses commas, periods, and capitalization, which can make it difficult to parse sentences and understand meaning.
