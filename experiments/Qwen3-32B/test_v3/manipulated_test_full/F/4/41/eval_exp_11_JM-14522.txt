This is a well-known short story by Oscar Wilde, "The Canterville Ghost," and I'll evaluate its fluency and coherence based on the provided text.

**Fluency Issues:**
- Several spelling errors appear throughout the text (e.g., "biught" instead of "bought", "alk" instead of "all", "fror its own sweet voice", "emiled", "thrse", "tge", "thr", "mch", "c", "witu", "closely barred", "emerald-green").
- There are numerous punctuation errors and missing punctuation marks.
- Some words are missing or incorrectly formed (e.g., "hie parents", "Anerican", "hrr", "Cbeshire", "tge", "thlught").
- Some sentences are awkwardly constructed or incomplete.
- There are occasional typos in names and places (e.g., "Stutfield" instead of "Stutfield", "Cheshire" misspelled as "Cbeshire" and "Chesire").

**Coherence Issues:**
- The overall story is coherent and follows a logical narrative arc.
- The plot progresses smoothly from the Otis family's purchase of Canterville Chase to their encounters with the ghost and the eventual resolution.
- The characters are consistent and their actions make sense within the story.
- The narrative structure with chapter divisions helps maintain coherence.
- The themes of the story (the clash between American pragmatism and British tradition, the redemption of the ghost) are clearly presented and developed.

The story is recognizable as Wilde's famous work, and despite the numerous typos and spelling errors, the narrative remains mostly coherent.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 2
