**Fluency Issues:**

- **Awkward sentence structure and run-on sentences:** The text contains numerous long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow and often lack clear punctuation (e.g., missing commas, semicolons, or periods). This disrupts the flow and makes the text feel cluttered.
  
- **Spelling and grammatical errors:** There are several misspellings and grammatical mistakes throughout the text (e.g., "admirirg," "dimentions," "euphony," "jageed," "beatiful," "pugh! pugh!"). These errors distract from the content and reduce readability.

- **Inconsistent verb tense and subject-verb agreement:** The text shifts between tenses and sometimes fails to maintain agreement between subjects and verbs, which affects clarity.

- **Word choice and redundancy:** Some word choices are awkward or imprecise (e.g., "veritable Garden of Eden," "beau ideal of a garden"), and the text often repeats ideas or phrases unnecessarily.

- **Poor punctuation:** The lack of proper punctuation, especially in descriptive and narrative passages, leads to confusion and makes the text feel unpolished.

**Coherence Issues:**

- **Lack of clear organization and structure:** The text jumps between ideas without clear transitions. It begins with a claim about the Garden of Eden, then shifts to geography, then to historical speculation, and then back to descriptions of the landscape. This makes it hard to follow the author’s main argument.

- **Unfocused argument:** The author presents multiple claims about the location of the Garden of Eden but does not clearly define or support a central thesis. The text reads more like a collection of observations and assertions than a coherent argument.

- **Overly detailed and tangential descriptions:** The text is filled with detailed descriptions of the landscape and local geography, but these descriptions often lack a clear purpose or connection to the main argument. This makes the text feel meandering and unfocused.

- **Inconsistent tone and voice:** The author shifts between a scholarly tone and a more casual, almost promotional one. This inconsistency in voice makes it difficult to take the argument seriously.

- **Lack of logical flow between paragraphs:** Many paragraphs begin with new ideas or observations that are not clearly connected to the previous ones. This disrupts the logical flow of the text and makes it hard to follow the author’s reasoning.
