### Issues Affecting Coherence:

1. **Length and Complexity**: The text is very long and dense, making it difficult to maintain a clear sense of the overall structure and purpose. The sheer volume of information and theological discussion can obscure the main argument.

2. **Repetition and Redundancy**: There is a significant amount of repetition of key points, which can make the argument feel circular and less coherent.

3. **Shift in Tone and Style**: The text moves between formal theological exposition and emotional appeals, which can disrupt the logical flow and make the argument feel inconsistent.

4. **Overly Technical Language**: The use of highly specialized theological terms and concepts without sufficient explanation can make it difficult for readers to follow the argument.

5. **Lack of Clear Transitions**: While the text is structured into chapters and sections, the transitions between these sections are often abrupt or unclear, making it hard to follow the logical progression of the argument.

6. **Multiple Subtopics**: The text attempts to address multiple theological topics (the Real Presence, adoration, sacrifice) and sometimes jumps between them without clear connections.

7. **Emotional vs. Logical Tone**: The author frequently shifts from logical analysis to emotional appeals, which can confuse the reader about the nature of the argument.

8. **Unnecessary Digressions**: There are several digressions that do not directly contribute to the main argument, such as long discussions of historical figures and their beliefs.

9. **Ambiguity in Argumentation**: At times, the argument is not clearly stated or is obscured by the author's polemical tone, making it difficult to determine the exact position being defended.

10. **Over-Reliance on Authority**: The text frequently appeals to the authority of the Church of England and the Reformers without always clearly linking these appeals to the logical argument being made.

### Issues Affecting Fluency:

1. **Complex Sentence Structure**: The text contains many long, complex sentences that are difficult to parse and understand at a glance.

2. **Overuse of Parentheses and Dashes**: The frequent use of parentheses and dashes interrupts the flow of reading and makes the text feel cluttered.

3. **Passive Voice**: The use of passive voice is pervasive and can make the text feel less direct and harder to follow.

4. **Wordiness**: The text is often unnecessarily wordy, with ideas expressed in a more roundabout way than necessary.

5. **Inconsistent Verb Tense and Voice**: There are occasional shifts in verb tense and voice that can be jarring to the reader.

6. **Repetition of Phrases**: The repetition of certain phrases and ideas can make the text feel monotonous and less fluent.

7. **Inconsistent Punctuation**: In some cases, punctuation is inconsistent or missing, which can affect readability.

8. **Overuse of Theological Jargon**: The heavy use of theological jargon without explanation can make the text feel inaccessible to readers unfamiliar with the terminology.

9. **Awkward Transitions**: The transitions between paragraphs and sections are sometimes awkward or abrupt, disrupting the smooth flow of the text.

10. **Lack of Rhetorical Variety**: The text relies heavily on a single rhetorical style (polemical and didactic), which can make it feel monotonous and less engaging.
