After carefully reading the provided text, I will evaluate it for fluency and coherence, identify issues, and then provide the final scores.

---

### **Fluency Issues:**

- **Formal and archaic language:** The text uses a very formal and somewhat archaic style of English, which may be difficult for modern readers to follow. While this is stylistically appropriate for the subject matter, it can affect readability for some audiences.
  
- **Sentence structure complexity:** Some sentences are very long and contain multiple clauses, which can make them hard to follow. For example: “It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift. It is enough for my present purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other, but that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does not cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing signified.”

- **Repetition and redundancy:** There is some repetition of ideas, especially in the early parts of the text. For example, the author repeats the point that the Church of England should not be judged by the assertions of its friends but by its own documents.

- **Use of archaic or uncommon words:** Words like “connexion,” “consecration,” “adored,” and “adversaries” are not commonly used in modern English and may cause confusion or slow reading pace.

- **Lack of punctuation in some places:** The text occasionally lacks commas or periods in long sentences, which can make the flow feel abrupt or jarring.

### **Coherence Issues:**

- **Logical flow within paragraphs:** While the overall argument is clear, some paragraphs contain multiple ideas that are not always clearly separated. For example, the discussion of the Articles and the Catechism could be more clearly segmented for better readability.

- **Sudden shifts in focus:** There are a few instances where the author shifts from one idea to another without clear transitional phrases. For example, after discussing the nature of the sacrament, the author shifts to the importance of examining the Church’s documents without clearly signaling the transition.

- **Ambiguity in key terms:** The term “Real Presence” is discussed at length, but the author does not clearly define it for the reader until later in the text. This can cause confusion for those unfamiliar with the theological context.

- **Overuse of theological jargon:** The text is highly specialized and assumes a certain level of prior knowledge. While this is appropriate for the intended audience, it may reduce coherence for readers who are not familiar with the subject.

- **Tone and audience mismatch:** The tone is very formal and theological, which may not align with the expectations of a general audience. This could reduce the overall coherence if the reader is not prepared for such a style.

### **FINAL Coherence Score: 4**
The text is generally well-organized and logically structured, with a clear progression of ideas. The author presents a thesis and then systematically examines it using church documents. However, the occasional abrupt shifts in focus and the lack of clear transitions between some paragraphs slightly reduce the overall coherence.

---

### **FINAL Fluency Score: 3**
The text is written in a formal, archaic style with complex sentence structures, which can make it difficult to read for a modern audience. While the language is grammatically correct and the ideas are clearly expressed, the fluency is reduced by the length of some sentences and the use of uncommon vocabulary.
