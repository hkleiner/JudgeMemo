**Fluency Issues:**

- **Grammar and Spelling Errors:** The text contains numerous grammatical errors, misspellings (e.g., “antldiluvians,” “admirirg,” “dimentions,” “jageed”), and incorrect word usage (e.g., “consitutes” instead of “constitutes,” “Bridtish” instead of “British”).
- **Awkward Sentence Structures:** Sentences are often long, convoluted, and lack proper punctuation, making them difficult to follow. For example: “From inherited wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right.”
- **Redundancy and Repetition:** The author frequently repeats phrases like “Our garden is still in the right place” and “Our garden is again right,” which hinders readability.
- **Inconsistent Verb Tense and Pronoun Use:** The text shifts between past and present tense without clear justification. Pronouns like “he” and “they” are sometimes unclear in reference.
- **Unnatural Word Choice and Phrasing:** The language is overly archaic and poetic in places, which can make the text feel forced or unnatural (e.g., “The finger of time has been plainly pointing…”).

**Coherence Issues:**

- **Lack of Logical Flow:** The text jumps between ideas and descriptions without clear transitions. The argument for Eden being in a specific location is presented but not systematically developed.
- **Unclear Connections Between Ideas:** The author makes numerous claims about the geography matching biblical descriptions but fails to clearly connect these claims to the text of the Bible or to the reader’s understanding.
- **Inconsistent Focus:** The narrative shifts between describing the geography, the author’s personal impressions, and speculative theological interpretations without a clear structure or guiding logic.
- **Unresolved References:** The author refers to specific people, places, and historical events (e.g., “Dr. Warren,” “Mr. Dovile,” “Trempealeau”) without sufficient context, making it difficult for the reader to follow.
- **Confusing Argument Structure:** The author asserts that the location has been found, but the reasoning is not clearly laid out. The argument is more impressionistic than analytical, and the connections between the geography and the Garden of Eden are not logically developed.
