**Fluency Issues:**
- **Sentence structure and punctuation:** Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example: “He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.” The lack of clear pauses and the dense phrasing reduce readability.
- **Word choice and phrasing:** Some expressions are archaic or obscure, such as “Youth will be served;” and “smacked of the apoplexy.” These may be stylistically appropriate for a literary analysis but can hinder fluency for modern readers.
- **Redundancy and repetition:** Phrases like “He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises” and “He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau” are repetitive and could be condensed.
- **Awkward transitions:** Some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, such as the shift from discussing Dickens’s health to the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*.

**Coherence Issues:**
- **Lack of clear organization:** While the text is an analysis of Dickens’s plot and style, it sometimes jumps between ideas without clear transitions or logical flow. For example, it moves abruptly from discussing Dickens’s health to a detailed character analysis.
- **Unresolved references:** Some references are left unexplained, such as the mention of “Mr. Cuming Walters” and his theories without sufficient context for the reader.
- **Ambiguous structure:** The text is written in a scholarly tone but lacks a clear introduction or roadmap for the reader. The reader is not always clear on the author’s main argument or purpose.
- **Overly detailed descriptions:** Some sections, such as the description of the characters in *Edwin Drood*, are very detailed but not always well-integrated into the broader analysis, making it difficult to follow the central argument.
