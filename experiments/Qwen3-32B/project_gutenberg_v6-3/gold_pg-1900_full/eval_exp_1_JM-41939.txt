(Wordy and complex sentence structure) - [GRAMMAR] "They joined him in 1829 and were installed in the Rue Saint-Antoine." (Slightly awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "The years which followed were equally unfortunate for Raymond Bonheur: Paris had hardly recovered from the shock of the Revolution, when in 1832 the cholera made its appearance." (Awkward transition between clauses)
