2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into distinct sections with "Wherein" headings, but these create artificial breaks rather than smooth narrative flow - [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts between different time periods and locations without adequate transition - [LOGIC] Some plot developments (like Kuei Ping's sudden departure) lack sufficient buildup or explanation - [CLARITY] The narrative voice shifts between third-person omniscient and more limited perspectives in confusing ways
