Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been a celebrated New York belle" (awkward punctuation and phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "belle" (should be "belle" but appears with inconsistent capitalization)
- [SYNTAX] "I have come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "spry young fellows painting the Old World red" (unclear and potentially inappropriate phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "with all our spry young fellows painting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and prima-donnas" (awkward and confusing sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "prima-donnas" (should be hyphenated consistently)
- [SYNTAX] "I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show" (long, complex sentence with unclear structure)
- [SYNTAX] "It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family" (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "impresarios" (correct but appears with inconsistent capitalization)

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, continuous narrative without clear paragraph breaks or chapter divisions (affecting readability)
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions (confusing for the reader)
- [CLARITY] Some character descriptions are overly detailed and could be condensed (affecting flow)
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the first appearance of the ghost is abrupt (lacks smooth progression)
- [LOGIC] The motivations and actions of the American characters (especially Washington Otis) are not always clearly explained (confusing for the reader)
- [STRUCTURE] The text includes multiple subplots and character interactions that could be better organized (affecting overall coherence)
- [LOGIC] The sudden disappearance and reappearance of the blood stain is not clearly explained (confusing for the reader)
- [CLARITY] Some of the dialogue is overly formal or archaic, creating a jarring effect with the modern American characters (affecting consistency)
