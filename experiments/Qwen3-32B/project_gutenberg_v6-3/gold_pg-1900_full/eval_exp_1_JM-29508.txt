Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "coöperation" is used consistently, but may be less common than "cooperation". - [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow. - [LEXICON] Some words are archaic or less commonly used (e.g., "Santander's caves" may be confusing to some readers). - [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some places, particularly in complex sentences. - [SPELLING] "rôle" is used instead of the more common "role".

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured overall, but the transition between some chapters could be improved. - [LOGIC] Some arguments could be more clearly connected to their conclusions. - [CLARITY] The dense philosophical content may make it challenging for some readers to follow the logical flow. - [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs transition abruptly between ideas without clear connections. - [CONSISTENCY] The text maintains a consistent theme, but some sub-arguments could be more clearly delineated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
