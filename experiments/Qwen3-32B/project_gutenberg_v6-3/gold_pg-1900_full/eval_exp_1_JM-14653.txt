(Awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "To blink the fact is infantile."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The text jumps between nostalgic descriptions of Christmas past and philosophical discussions about the nature of faith and scepticism without clear transitions. - [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear progression of ideas, moving abruptly from personal memories to abstract philosophical arguments. - [CLARITY] The author's central argument about the decline of Christmas spirit and its connection to modern scepticism is often obscured by tangential discussions. - [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between the different chapters, making the overall structure feel disjointed. - [LOGIC] The argument about Christmas as a symbol of faith is not consistently developed throughout the text. - [STRUCTURE] The text begins with personal memories but shifts to philosophical arguments without clear connection to the initial narrative. - [CLARITY] The author's argument about Christmas being connected to the winter solstice is presented without sufficient explanation or context. - [LOGIC] The discussion about the "Feast of St. Friend" in the final chapter feels disconnected from the earlier philosophical arguments. - [STRUCTURE] The text oscillates between nostalgic recollections, philosophical musings, and practical advice without clear organization. - [CLARITY] The author's argument about the importance of goodwill is not clearly connected to the earlier discussions about Christmas. - [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the decline of Christmas spirit to proposing solutions feels abrupt and underdeveloped. - [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear thesis statement that would unify the various themes and arguments presented.
