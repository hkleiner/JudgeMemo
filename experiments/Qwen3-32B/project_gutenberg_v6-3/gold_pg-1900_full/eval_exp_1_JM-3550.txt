- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured, but some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear.  
- [LOGIC] A few plot points are introduced without sufficient foreshadowing or explanation, potentially confusing the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The motivations of certain characters (e.g., Adolpheâ€™s internal conflict) are not always clearly conveyed.  
- [TRANSITION] Some shifts in time or perspective are not smoothly executed, slightly disrupting the flow.
