Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised as well as we do, that while students, like the poor, are always with us, great artists are few and far between..." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "Shakspere" (archaic spelling, but not an error per se, though inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise his own limitations..." (awkward word order)  
- [SPELLING] "Michelangelo had impressed him deeply. In later days he never lost an opportunity of advising students to sit at the feet of the great master..." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [LEXICON] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." (awkward phrasing and use of "will probably" for past events)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist, and his references to Gainsborough and Romney, whose success and accomplishments galled him not a little." (overly complex sentence structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had human weaknesses to live down, and it is to his credit that he conquered all or most of them." (missing comma for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a supreme facility for taking from every artist the best that was in him, melting it in the crucible of his own thought, and applying the product to his pictures." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He had found time to enjoy the pursuits of a country gentleman; he shoots and hunts in the best sporting circles." (sudden shift in narrative tone without clear connection to the broader argument)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Reynolds' artistic achievements, personal life, and historical context without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "He had a supreme facility for taking from every artist the best that was in him, melting it in the crucible of his own thought, and applying the product to his pictures." (confusing metaphor and unclear logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "There is no doubt that the sixteenth-century Venetians impressed Reynolds as much as they impressed Ruskin at a later date, but in the middle of the eighteenth century the school of Bologna was in the ascendant in England..." (awkward comparison between two different time periods without clear explanation)  
- [TRANSITION] "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist, and his references to Gainsborough and Romney, whose success and accomplishments galled him not a little." (sudden shift from Reynolds' virtues to his personal flaws without transition)  
- [LOGIC] "He was always perfect master of his self-control, and when the years had toned down certain faults of thought and manner, he became mellowed, like old wine, and not less stimulating." (awkward comparison and unclear logical progression)  
- [CLARITY] "He had human weaknesses to live down, and it is to his credit that he conquered all or most of them." (vague and ambiguous statement)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text frequently introduces new ideas without clearly linking them to the previous context.
