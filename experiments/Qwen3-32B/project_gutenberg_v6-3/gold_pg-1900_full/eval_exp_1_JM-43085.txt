2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of ideas across paragraphs (e.g., the theme of Meissonierâ€™s meticulousness is repeated without progression)  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between sections are abrupt (e.g., moving from early life to early career without clear narrative flow)  
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions that obscure the main narrative (e.g., excessive focus on costume details in military paintings section)  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between chapters (e.g., from "Early Years" to "First Success" lacks a clear narrative bridge)  
- [FOCUS] Some sections drift into tangential topics (e.g., detailed descriptions of etchings that do not significantly contribute to the overall biography)
