Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions in some sentences (e.g., "The decision to discuss the question of Woman Suffrage at this Congress was not arrived at from any theoretical considerations").  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Social-Democrats" vs. "Social-Democracy").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "We have been much more interested in the tactics and in the historical events about which I am now going to speak").  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or formal language that disrupts natural flow (e.g., "Comrades," "therefore," "hence").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas and lack of punctuation in long sentences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression of ideas, with abrupt transitions between historical examples and political arguments.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without clear connections to the central thesis (e.g., detailed statistics without contextual explanation).  
- [CLARITY] Repetition of points without building upon them (e.g., the distinction between middle-class and working-class suffrage demands is repeated multiple times without added depth).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs and sections, making the narrative feel disjointed.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent focus between historical analysis, political theory, and practical activism, leading to a fragmented argument.
