Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The invention of printing books, and the use of wood-blocks for book ornament in place of hand-painting, though it belongs to the period of the degradation of mediæval art, gave an opportunity to the Germans to regain the place which they had lost in the art of book decoration during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries." (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "mediæval" (archaic spelling, not an error but may affect fluency for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] "An exception must be made, however, as to Albert Dürer; for, though his method was infected by the Renaissance, his matchless imagination and intellect made him thoroughly Gothic in spirit." (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "I am obliged to link the two cities, because the early school at least is common to both; but the ornamented works produced by Ulm are but few compared with the prolific birth of Augsburg." (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "It is a matter of course that the names of the artists who designed these wood-blocks should not have been recorded, any more than those of the numberless illuminators of the lovely written books of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries;" (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and dense with information, making it challenging to follow the overall structure and main points.
- [CLARITY] The text jumps between specific examples and broader historical context without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The connection between the woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts is not always clear, especially in the transition between chapters.
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases to guide the reader through the complex information and multiple examples.
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about the importance of woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts is not clearly tied back to the opening statements.
