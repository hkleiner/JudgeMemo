Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers, notably by Carlo Ridolfi." (awkward phrasing with "notably by")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The correct date is now verified by the discovery, in San Samuele of Venice, Veronese's parish church, of the register of deaths wherein the decease of the great painter is entered as having occurred the 19th of April, 1588..." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was not long in finding that the limited scope afforded by his native city was too narrow for his activity." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He painted the saintly anchorite defending himself against the blows which the Devil is dealing him with a stick and repulsing the advances of a woman who has been raised up from hell itself to tempt him." (awkward phrasing and overuse of "which")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The cardinal instituted a sort of rivalry between these four artists, and gave them orders for four pictures, destined to be competitive." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Veronese lost no time in returning to Verona, but, however flattering the esteem with which his compatriots surrounded him might be, he was not long in finding..." (overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We have no reliable document regarding these first years of his residence there, nor even of the impressions produced upon him by the opulent and magnificent city." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "All that it is possible to know--and to this his paintings abundantly bear witness--is that he was possessed of an agreeable humour..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)

- [LOGIC] "He not only decorated the ceilings of her palaces and the walls of her churches: but he took the city of his adoption as the setting for all his compositions..." (confusing use of "but" in a list)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The future genial painter of wondrous fantasy yielded himself without a murmur to the rude but salutary exigencies of technique." (sudden shift in tone and focus)  
- [LOGIC] "Strange caprice on the part of an artist who was destined to show so much dexterity in execution and lavishness in decoration, his tastes turned towards the most severe and least imaginative of masters..." (confusing sentence structure and logic)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The result of this friendly collaboration was a complete series of paintings, of great diversity: hunting scenes, banquets, dances and numerous subjects borrowed from mythology or from history..." (awkward transition and listing)  
- [LOGIC] "He ran the danger of acquiring mannerisms and becoming an imitator. By a special grace accorded to genius alone, Veronese succeeded in remaining himself..." (sudden shift from danger to resolution with minimal explanation)  
- [LOGIC] "If he wished to paint a Last Supper, it mattered little to him that legend and history agree regarding the simplicity and the humble station of Jesus and his disciples: History and tradition did not count with him." (confusing phrasing and abrupt conclusion)  
- [LOGIC] "Accordingly no one could justly appraise Veronese, without first setting aside, as he did, all those historic data which he voluntarily ignored." (confusing and awkward phrasing)
