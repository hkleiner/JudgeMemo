Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons was sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., 'To thee, Thomas Becket, some time Archbishop of Canterbury'--who had then been dead for 368 years--'to appear within thirty days to answer to a charge of treason, contumacy, and rebellion against his sovereign lord, King Henry II.'" (Awkward phrasing and inconsistent quotation usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The remains were not burned, but throughout the land every statue, wall-painting, and window to the said Thomas Becket was rigorously searched out and destroyed..." (Subject-verb agreement error: "window" is singular but "was" is used instead of "were")  
- [SPELLING] "cosmopolitan groups of travel-soiled men and women who for century after century feasted their eyes from the selfsame spot" (Spelling and phrasing inconsistencies)  
- [SYNTAX] "It would be a mistake to imagine that it solely was due to that bloody deed..." (Awkward word order)  
- [SPELLING] "PalÃ¦olithic" and "Durovernum" (Inconsistent diacritics and archaic spelling)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He even provided them with quarters in Canterbury, and in the old church of St. Martin outside the city, where Queen Bertha had been in the habit of worshipping with her chaplain, Augustine and his monks began to preach..." (Run-on sentence with unclear structure)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (Incorrect diacritics)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It would be a mistake to imagine that it solely was due to that bloody deed..." (Sudden shift from the medieval pilgrimage to broader historical context without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between historical periods and events with minimal explanation or connection (e.g., from Roman to Saxon to medieval to modern times)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, especially when moving from one historical era to another  
- [CLARITY] "The new buildings therefore arose with their foundations some feet above the original level of the Romano-British city." (Unclear explanation of the architectural shift)  
- [LOGIC] "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association..." (Abrupt conclusion with speculative future implications not clearly connected to the narrative)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
