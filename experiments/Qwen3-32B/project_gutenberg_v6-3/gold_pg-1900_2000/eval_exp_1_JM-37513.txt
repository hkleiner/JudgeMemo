- [CLARITY] The abstract philosophical concepts are sometimes presented in a dense and convoluted manner, making them difficult to follow  
- [TRANSITION] There are few clear links between paragraphs, making the progression of ideas feel disjointed at times  
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative occasionally shifts from the author's personal experience to broader philosophical discussions without smooth transitions
