Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had in his courtesy invited me to dinner" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [GRAMMAR] "he proposed to take the rôle that night of a man who had been successful in business" is structurally confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "rôle" is spelled with an accent, which is unnecessary in standard English.  
- [SYNTAX] "but I am minded to speak of the bookman rather than of his books" is archaic and slightly awkward.  
- [SYNTAX] "He is proudly conscious at the time that he is a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement" is overly complex and convoluted.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between anecdotes and philosophical musings without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear organizational structure, making it difficult to follow the central argument.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between a "bookman" and a "bookowner" is not consistently clarified throughout the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the anecdote about the businessman to the bushman is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about "The chief office of the critic" feels tacked on and not well integrated with the earlier examples.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
