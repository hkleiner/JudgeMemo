Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" (hyphen usage inconsistent)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I begun to get a little anxious" (incorrect past tense "begun" instead of "began")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I begun to see I’d woke up a pretty ugly customer" (multiple incorrect verb forms)  
- [LEXICON] "I’ve seen comets out there that couldn’t even lay down inside the _orbits_ of our noblest comets without their tails hanging over" (ambiguous phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He jumped at that crowd, with his trumpet in his hand, and sung out—" (missing punctuation after dialogue)  
- [SPELLING] "I’ve wandered a little off the track of my tale; I’ll get back on my course again." (awkward phrasing and semicolon misuse)  
- [SPELLING] "I don’t reckon I’ll ever get over being sorry about it." (colloquial phrasing may be distracting to some readers)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I judged I was going to fetch up in pretty warm quarters when I got through" (awkward syntax)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from racing a comet to arriving at a mysterious location with "gates" and "people" (jarring transition)  
- [CLARITY] Confusing dialogue with clerks about "San Francisco," "California," and "America" (confusing context for reader)  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of the phrase "Peters" interrupts narrative flow and may distract from the story  
- [LOGIC] The transition from a high-speed journey through space to an immediate arrival at a defined location is abrupt and lacks explanation  
- [LOGIC] The character’s interactions with the clerks are disjointed and lack clear resolution or purpose  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "kazarks" is introduced without explanation, making it hard for readers to grasp its significance  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts from a dramatic space race to a bureaucratic scene without clear motivation or transition
