Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely..." (missing punctuation between clauses)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely..." (comma missing between independent clauses)  
- [SYNTAX] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist..." (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." (misplaced comma)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "There is hardly a "Lion Comique," or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene..." (confusing comparison to modern times)  
- [CLARITY] "There is no doubt that the sixteenth-century Venetians impressed Reynolds as much as they impressed Ruskin at a later date..." (vague reference to "they")  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from Reynolds' artistic development to his personal life and character without clear transitions in several sections.  
- [TRANSITION] "Many artists remain painters all their lives. Meet them in a studio or at a private view and they are illuminating; talk about another lying outside their immediate interests and they are dumb..." (sudden shift in tone and subject)  
- [LOGIC] "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company, even though we may think in our heart of hearts that the benefit of the inspiration was not without serious drawbacks." (unclear what the "serious drawbacks" are)
