Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have been asked to write an introduction to the story of 'The Bowmen', on its publication in book form together with three other tales of similar fashion." (awkward phrasing, missing preposition)  
- [SYNTAX] "I propose, then, to solve the difficulty by apologising for beginning at all." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "magnates and lords and princes of literature, whom he is merely serving as groom of the chamber." (confusing phrasing and word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "This was not the tale of 'The Bowmen'. It was the first sketch, as it were, of 'The Soldiers' Rest'." (awkward transition)  
- [LEXICON] "But every man is the child of his age, however much he may hate it; and our popular religion has long determined that jollity is wicked." (ambiguous phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "As far as I can make out modern Protestantism believes that Heaven is something like Evensong in an English cathedral, the service by Stainer and the Dean preaching." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "For those opposed to dogma of any kind--even the mildest--I suppose it is held that a Course of Ethical Lectures will be arranged." (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [SYNTAX] "I have long maintained that on the whole the average church, considered as a house of preaching, is a much more poisonous place than the average tavern; still, as I say, one's age masters one, and clouds and bewilders the intelligence..." (awkward and overly complex sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "And the real story of 'The Soldiers' Rest', with its 'sonus epulantium in æterno convivio', was ruined at the moment of its birth..." (unfamiliar Latin phrase without explanation)  
- [SYNTAX] "It seemed that my light fiction had been accepted by the congregation of this particular church as the solidest of facts..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different aspects of the story without clear transitions (e.g., from the introduction of the story to philosophical musings about religion and angels).  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure or progression, making it difficult to follow the author's main argument or purpose.  
- [CLARITY] The author's intent is often unclear, especially in the sections where he discusses the psychological and cultural implications of the legend.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the author's personal reflections and the development of the "Bowmen" legend are abrupt and disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The author shifts from discussing the origins of the story to its reception and then to philosophical reflections without clear connections between these sections.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of phrases like "sonus epulantium in æterno convivio" is not explained, which hinders understanding.  
- [LOGIC] The author discusses the popularity of the legend and its transformation from a fictional story to a widely believed myth, but the causal relationships between these events are not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] The author's tone is often ambiguous, making it unclear whether he is being ironic, sincere, or critical of the legend.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is meandering, with multiple tangents and digressions that do not contribute to a unified message.  
- [LOGIC] The author's discussion of the transformation of the "Bowmen" into "Angels of Mons" lacks a clear explanation of how or why this transformation occurred.
