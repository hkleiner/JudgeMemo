Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house." (Awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SYNTAX] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." (Missing "the" before "opinion")  
- [SPELLING] "I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody." (Awkward and slightly unnatural phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." (Unnatural word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime." (Capitalization of "Crime" is unnecessary and disrupts flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena." (Unnecessary and overly academic phrasing that disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from detailed character descriptions to the ghost's appearance, creating a minor disconnect.  
- [CLARITY] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." (Unclear and awkward phrasing that disrupts the logical progression)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family's evening drive to the ghost's appearance is slightly abrupt.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
