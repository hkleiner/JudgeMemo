Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or missing punctuation in some sentences.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in long sentences, e.g., "There is something, to my eyes at least, exceedingly pleasing in the general desire evinced by the humbler classes of society..."  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling issues, e.g., "pleasurers" instead of "pleasurers" is likely intentional, but could be misread.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly formal vocabulary that may disrupt modern readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in tone and subject matter (e.g., from the joy of Sunday to the harsh critique of religious services).  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, making the flow of ideas less smooth.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense, reducing clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between contrasting viewpoints (e.g., the contrast between the fashionable church and the dissentersâ€™ chapel).
