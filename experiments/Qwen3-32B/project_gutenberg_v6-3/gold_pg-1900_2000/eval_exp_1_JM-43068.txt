Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The same incisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the Dutchmen..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The outlines of the landscape, the very shape of the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ materially in various districts..." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in the world of art." (awkward syntax)  
- [SPELLING] "m√©nage" (correct, but may be considered a minor fluency issue due to non-standard spelling for some readers)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between historical context, analysis of Millet's works, and philosophical reflection without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Dutch and French peasant painters is occasionally unclear in its purpose or relevance.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and dense, making the argument harder to follow (e.g., the long sentence about the shepherd and the sunset).  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the analysis of Millet's artistic style and his personal life is abrupt and lacks a clear logical connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
