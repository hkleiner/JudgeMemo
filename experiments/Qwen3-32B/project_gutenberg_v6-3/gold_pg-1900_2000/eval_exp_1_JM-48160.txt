Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater" – missing article and awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit easily obtained" – missing preposition ("easily obtained from...").  
- [SPELLING] "intensive" – incorrect word; should be "intense" or "insular".  
- [SYNTAX] "If you bring even one letter to society, either in France or any European capital, all doors are open to you" – awkward phrasing and unclear meaning.  
- [SYNTAX] "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe, and long since came to the conclusion that all American embassies feel they are created for is to look solemn and important and give receptions" – missing article and awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "immatriculation" – misspelled or obscure word with no explanation.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have felt like an inverted snob trying to ingratiate myself with, or even to meet members, of that curious caste" – missing preposition and awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I made no attempt to enter this proscribed region for six or seven weeks after my arrival, having the thousand and one phases of woman’s work in the war to examine" – awkward and wordy phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "If you lose your permis de séjour you cannot leave Paris until the end of the war" – missing article.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could not go outside of Paris, as without my permis de séjour I was unable to obtain a sauf conduit" – awkward phrasing and redundancy.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between personal anecdotes, historical context, and bureaucratic details without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative lacks a clear progression; the author's goal and motivation for visiting the war zone are not clearly established or resolved.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts in focus, such as from the author's personal experience to the battlefield descriptions, with no clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms (e.g., "permis de séjour," "sauf conduit," "carnet rouge") are used without explanation, making the text inaccessible to some readers.  
- [LOGIC] The author's frustration with the bureaucracy is not clearly connected to the broader narrative or purpose of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized by events rather than by a clear thematic or chronological structure, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] The author's goal of "doing publicity work for an oeuvre" is introduced but not fully explained or contextualized.  
- [LOGIC] The author's decision to visit certain locations (e.g., Meaux) is presented without clear reasoning or relevance to the main narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The significance of the author's visits to specific war zones is not clearly explained or connected to the broader theme.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the author's personal journey to descriptions of the battlefield is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.
