Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent and excessive use of semicolons and commas.
- [SPELLING] Spelling inconsistencies such as "Cognizance" vs. "Cognition" or "Doway" instead of "Douai".
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic and non-modern vocabulary (e.g., "tho'", "dastardly", "Quarters", "mouldred") that may be confusing to modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing and grammatical structures, such as "This Gentleman's Character must appear the more sublime, when we observe how he advanced himself by Merit from a private Cadit to the Rank he held at his Death".
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses that are difficult to parse.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is disjointed and jumps between different narrative threads without clear transitions (e.g., from the affidavit to the historical commentary on heroism).
- [LOGIC] The narrative lacks a clear chronological structure, making it difficult to follow the progression of events in Hannah Snell's life.
- [CLARITY] The text is dense with archaic language and elaborate descriptions, which can obscure the main narrative and make it hard to follow.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in tone and content (e.g., from a legal document to a historical essay) disrupt the flow and make the text feel fragmented.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
