Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I must not accept just a mere job" (awkward phrasing; "just a mere job" is redundant)
- [GRAMMAR] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession." (awkward and overly wordy)
- [GRAMMAR] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted in the field of education." (awkward phrasing; unclear construction)
- [GRAMMAR] "One of the chief weaknesses of such teachers has usually been found to be in English." (awkward and passive voice)
- [GRAMMAR] "The large majority of superintendents encourage their teachers to feel that they want them to improve professionally..." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different characters and settings with minimal transitions, making the flow of the story feel disjointed.
- [LOGIC] The contrast between the two young men is effective, but the transition between their stories is abrupt and lacks clear connection to the main theme.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs contain long, complex sentences that make it difficult to follow the main point or argument.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the first chapter to the second is abrupt and lacks a clear thematic or structural connection.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces ideas without clearly linking them to the broader theme of entering and succeeding in the teaching profession.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
