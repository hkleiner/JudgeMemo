Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Now everybody don’t get scared" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some dialogue lines  
- [SPELLING] "Sic’em" appears inconsistently as "Sic’em" and "Old Sic’em"  
- [LEXICON] "Old Sic’em" is used as both a name and a descriptor, causing ambiguity  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "If he had only gone inside the house to ask his mother. But he didn’t. He never even thought of it..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrative when the story returns to Little Jack Rabbit and Old Sic’em in the final chapter without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The final chapter introduces new plot elements (the Willow Tree) without sufficient setup or connection to previous chapters  
- [CLARITY] The role and actions of Mr. Longtooth Rat are introduced mid-narrative without clear context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between chapters and scenes, such as from the escape of Danny Fox to his later appearance with a missing tail  
- [CONSISTENCY] The name "Mrs. John Rabbit" appears once and is inconsistent with the rest of the narrative
