1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in dialogue tags and sentence structure. - [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors such as "trem" instead of "tem" in "Battersea trem?" - [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures that occasionally hinder smooth reading. - [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dernier cri," "eschewed") that may confuse some readers. - [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in sentence fragments and phrasing.

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Some abrupt shifts in narrative focus (e.g., from the search for the Dogs' Home to the golf course scene). - [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs and scenes, making the flow of the story feel disjointed at times. - [CLARITY] Occasional ambiguity in character actions and motivations, especially in the chase scene. - [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is generally logical, but the pacing and sequence of events could be tighter.
