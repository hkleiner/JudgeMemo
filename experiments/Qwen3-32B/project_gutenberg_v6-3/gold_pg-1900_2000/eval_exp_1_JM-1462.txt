- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly between the old woman's life and historical references, making it difficult to follow a clear thread.

- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] Some references (e.g., Queen Charlotte’s snuff, the “Vicar of Wakefield”) are mentioned without sufficient context for full comprehension.
