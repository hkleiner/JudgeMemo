Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Yet, at the present time there is not enough evidence this last happened that simply, so we shall attempt..." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Because he followed game is probably the main reason he arrived here..." (inverted sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "ocher" (likely intended as "ochre")  
- [SYNTAX] "The only material remains found was a Folsom-like projectile point." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "Bootherium sp." (missing period after "sp")  
- [GRAMMAR] "What he looked like, we have no idea; but he was apparently..." (awkward transition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He may have stayed where his descendants later became what we now call the 'Basketmakers.'" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Carlsbad Caverns National Park has a wide temperature and altitude range, and four life zones (Upper and Lower Sonoran, Canadian, and Transition)." (missing comma before "and four")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Because he followed game is probably the main reason..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Tetrameryx" (misspelled or obscure term without context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from Early Man to Basketmakers without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the Apaches and Comanches is presented without sufficient context or connection to the main narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The explanation of the Carlsbad Basketmakers' disappearance is speculative and lacks a clear logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The section on the Carlsbad Caverns' entrance lacks a smooth transition to the section on burial practices.  
- [LOGIC] The claim about the "superstitious nature of the Indians" is introduced without supporting evidence or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on animals in the cave is somewhat disconnected from the broader narrative about human use of the cavern.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the life zones is introduced abruptly and is not clearly tied to the narrative of the Indians.  
- [CLARITY] The use of terms like "Cochise complex" and "Basketmaker" without definition or explanation may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.  
- [STRUCTURE] The conclusion about the Basketmakers joining Pueblo groups is introduced without sufficient buildup or evidence.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the influence of the Pueblo Indians is presented without clear cause-effect explanation.
