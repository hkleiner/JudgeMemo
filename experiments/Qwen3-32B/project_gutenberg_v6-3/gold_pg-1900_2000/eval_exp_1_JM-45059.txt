Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "The Reminiscences of a Citizen whose memory goes back in detail for over Seventy Years, as in the case of the Contributor of these Notes, cannot fail to be of paramount interest..."  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Peterborough" vs. "Peterboro’")  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or uncommon phrasing, e.g., "You see it is an ill wind that blows nobody good."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation, e.g., missing commas in long sentences.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, e.g., "There was an enormous destruction of timber" (should be "There was an enormous destruction of timber").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, e.g., the shift from the toll bar system to the story about the calculating boy.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is loosely structured, with some segments appearing disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to people and places without sufficient context for modern readers.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, especially when moving from one anecdote to another.  
- [CONNECTION] Some anecdotes feel loosely connected to the main narrative about Peterborough’s development.
