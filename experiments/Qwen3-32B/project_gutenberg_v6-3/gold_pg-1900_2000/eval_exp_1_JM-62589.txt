Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "There was a Molly, there was a Debby Mason" lacks parallel structure).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and missing commas (e.g., "’Tis a lie!” screamed the girl).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and overly complex sentences (e.g., "In meeting, thy case hath been considered...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or non-standard word usage (e.g., "’tis," "thee," "thou") that may be distracting to modern readers.  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "peter" vs. "Peter" in similar contexts).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression in the second chapter, with abrupt shifts in focus.  
- [LOGIC] Some plot points are introduced without sufficient explanation (e.g., Debby’s sudden transformation in behavior).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "Jack Martin" is mentioned without clear introduction).  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs and scenes, especially between the two chapters.  
- [CHARACTERIZATION] Inconsistent portrayal of Mrs. Lane’s motivations and Debby’s emotions, leading to confusion.
