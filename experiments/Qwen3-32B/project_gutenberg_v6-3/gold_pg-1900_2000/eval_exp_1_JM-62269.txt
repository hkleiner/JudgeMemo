Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He who stepped through the battered door in St. Andrew Street travelled fifteen hundred miles in a second." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "And then the English Gypsy women fell in love with Vola’s baby, and the English Gypsy men were impressed by Kola’s size and ability, and the gorgeous display of gold touched a responsive chord in all their hearts." (Cumbersome and run-on sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "He who stepped through the battered door in St. Andrew Street travelled fifteen hundred miles in a second." (Unnatural word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He may be all of these if a short period of residence is sufficient qualification." (Missing preposition—"if a short period of residence is sufficient **as** a qualification")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The craft of the Gypsies was magnificent, and they wielded their hammers sensitively, as if there were nerve-endings in the heads." (Ambiguous pronoun reference—"the heads" refers to hammers)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He who stepped through the battered door in St. Andrew Street travelled fifteen hundred miles in a second." (Metaphor is confusing and disrupts narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from descriptive setting to abstract philosophical reflection in the final paragraph of Chapter 2.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the detailed description of the Gypsies' arrival and the shift to Kola's character and philosophy.  
- [CLARITY] "Kola’s policy is successful; it has made him rich." (Lacks context and explanation of how the policy works)  
- [LOGIC] "Kola’s kingdom should be impossible." (Abrupt shift to a moral or philosophical evaluation with little buildup)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
