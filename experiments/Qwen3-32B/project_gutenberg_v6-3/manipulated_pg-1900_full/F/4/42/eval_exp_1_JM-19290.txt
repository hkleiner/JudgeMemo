2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical context and theological exposition without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs introduce concepts (e.g., "the Day of God") without sufficient explanation for clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear subheadings or paragraph breaks to guide the reader through complex ideas.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces new ideas without connecting them to the previous content.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex and difficult to follow (e.g., "The sequence of the Divine Revelations, the Báb asserts, is 'a process that hath had no beginning and will have no end.'").  
- [LOGIC] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about Bahá’u’lláh and religious history without providing context for general readers.  
- [STRUCTURE] The flow between sections is sometimes abrupt, making it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic language and religious terminology may obscure the meaning for some readers.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally shifts between different themes (e.g., from historical events to philosophical concepts) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The frequent use of metaphors and allusions may be confusing without additional explanation.
