- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect past tense forms (e.g., "we do not knew", "they would not had any business", "they am carried")
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect prepositions (e.g., "from the north they came, this much we know, and comparatively recently")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles (e.g., "the Carlsbad Caverns National Park", "the Apache Reservation")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "So, let us started our story", "It is rare that research into any subject is done alone. This is no exception, for many are responsible in their contributions")
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors (e.g., "mited" instead of "midden", "was was" instead of "was", "mated" instead of "matted")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas in lists, missing periods at the end of sentences)
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent word choice (e.g., "mated" vs "midden", "was" vs "were" in similar contexts)
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of tenses (e.g., "The Mescalero Apache Reservation was establish", "The Mescalero Apaches show a curious mixture")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and could be broken into smaller, more focused sections
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother (e.g., sudden shifts from one topic to another without clear connections)
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without sufficient context or explanation (e.g., specific archaeological terms without definition)
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between chapters and sections could be improved to better connect related content
- [LOGIC] Some statements are presented as facts when they are actually interpretations or theories (e.g., "The Mescaleros were never considered as dangerous as their brethren farther west")
- [STRUCTURE] The organization of some chapters could be improved to better follow a logical progression (e.g., the Apache chapter could be more clearly structured)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
