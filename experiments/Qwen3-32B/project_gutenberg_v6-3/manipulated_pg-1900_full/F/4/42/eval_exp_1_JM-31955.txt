Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "was found in any of the writings of any of the authors," "was to be found").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tenses and forms (e.g., "must had known," "was to be found," "was found").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "was" instead of "were," "had" instead of "has").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., long, complex sentences with multiple clauses).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas in complex sentences).  
- [LEXICON] Word choice inconsistencies (e.g., "Savages" repeated frequently with no variation).  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of passive voice where active voice would be clearer (e.g., "was to be found" instead of "could be found").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of ideas and phrases (e.g., "Niagara was a Center of Trade" repeated in multiple sections).  
- [LOGIC] Weak transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., abrupt shifts between historical accounts and scientific observations).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "it" referring to unclear antecedents in multiple instances).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear progression from one section to another (e.g., moving from legends to geological observations without clear links).  
- [LOGIC] Some ideas presented without sufficient context or explanation (e.g., references to historical figures or events without background).
