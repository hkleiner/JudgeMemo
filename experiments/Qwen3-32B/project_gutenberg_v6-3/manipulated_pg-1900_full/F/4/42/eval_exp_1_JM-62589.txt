- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear progression between chapters (e.g., sudden jump from Debby’s life to the Revolutionary War battles).  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory character behavior (e.g., Debby’s fierce independence and then sudden submission to others).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing timeline (e.g., unclear time jumps between events and character developments).  
- [LOGIC] Lack of resolution for key plot points (e.g., the mystery of Debby’s twin and Morley’s mother is only partially resolved).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear cause-effect relationships (e.g., Debby’s transformation into Molly is not clearly motivated).
