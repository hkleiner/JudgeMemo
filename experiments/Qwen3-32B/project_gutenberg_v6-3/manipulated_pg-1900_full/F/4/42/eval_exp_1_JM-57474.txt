2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between historical examples and theoretical arguments without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is dense and repetitive, with multiple sub-topics that are not clearly organized.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow (e.g., "We, on the contrary, basing our demand on the teachings of economics and of history, advocate the suffrage for women as a social right, which was not based on any natural right, but which rests on social, transient conditions.").  
- [LOGIC] The speaker shifts between addressing the audience ("Comrades") and making abstract historical arguments, which disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction or summary that frames the main argument or conclusion.  
- [LOGIC] The resolution at the end is somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion and feels abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic or formal language ("Comrades," "it was stated that Woman Suffrage is required") makes the text feel disjointed from modern readers.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt, especially when moving from one country or example to another.  
- [LOGIC] The repeated emphasis on the differences between middle-class and working-class women is repetitive and not clearly tied to a central thesis.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally contradicts itself in tone (e.g., shifting from critical to supportive of middle-class women's movements without clear justification).
