Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "many a negro and soldier for that matter, would stake their money" â€“ "many a" should be singular).  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of past tense (e.g., "we did not experienced much difficulty," "we had exhausted every means we could conceive of").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms (e.g., "Bragg woulded continue," "casualties am 20 per cent," "the world war has cost us eighteen billion dollars. The civil war cost us $5,160,000,000").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect prepositions (e.g., "to avoided getting lost," "to have a chance at the roast turkey").  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles (e.g., "the 78th constructed the gallows and furnished the guard," "we had a sharp skirmish in which Lieutenant McAndless of Co. I was killed").  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect spelling (e.g., "know" instead of "known," "marched to Franklin, Tenn., where it remained four months").  
- [SPELLING] Repeated incorrect past tense (e.g., "we had camp where there were some rail fences," "the brigade enter Shelbyville").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., "It covered the earth to a depth of a little more than two feet. The night for the party arrived, and not Johnnies, snow, pickets, nor anything else would have stopped that gang").  
- [LEXICON] Non-standard or ambiguous word usage (e.g., "we decided it was all off," "he was visiting friends in Quincy when he enlist and he being the only son of aged parents").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or misplaced commas and periods (e.g., "the faithful Jack, spoken of before, came in with a chicken and we proceeded to cook it and have a supper out of the general order of things").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in narrative without clear transitions (e.g., from a battle scene to a detailed recount of camp life).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed chronological flow (e.g., some events are mentioned out of order or with unclear temporal references).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "he" or "they" referring to multiple possible antecedents without clear identification).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transition between paragraphs (e.g., abrupt jump from the Atlanta campaign to a comparison of the Civil War and World War I).  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of events with no new context (e.g., multiple references to Chickamauga without clear progression).  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent narrative focus (e.g., switching between personal anecdotes and broader historical context without clear framing).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., how a specific event led to a larger consequence is not always explained).  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent use of time markers (e.g., "On the 19th day of September we were put on coal cars..." followed by "On the same raid on the morning of Dec. 30th...").  
- [CLARITY] Confusing sentence structure in complex descriptions (e.g., "the brigade to which we belonged was massed in front of the Rebel entrenchments and at 9 a.m., on the 27th of June, the command jumped the works on a charge to capture the enemy's entrenchments").  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear introduction or conclusion to the text.
