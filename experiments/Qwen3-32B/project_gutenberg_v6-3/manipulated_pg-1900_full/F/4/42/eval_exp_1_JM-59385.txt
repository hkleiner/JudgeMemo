Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "shadows was long", "mighted carry", "have been sufficient").  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistencies (e.g., "could went", "had am found", "have am taught").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "ventured", "stiff", "unnoted").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or ungrammatical sentence structures (e.g., "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia").  
- [LEXICON] Misused or incorrect word choices (e.g., "have been sufficient for only a very simple mode of life", "stilled into pleasantness the dreams").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in narrative perspective (e.g., the final section shifts to a first-person narrator with no prior setup).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed segments (e.g., the repeated "Wherein..." headings disrupt the flow and make the narrative feel fragmented).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear transitions between events and ideas (e.g., the abrupt transition from Kuei Ping's life to the narrator's experience).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections, especially between the main story and the framing device at the end.  
- [LOGIC] Some plot points or character decisions are not adequately explained (e.g., the sudden decision for Kuei Ping to leave her family without clear motivation).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
