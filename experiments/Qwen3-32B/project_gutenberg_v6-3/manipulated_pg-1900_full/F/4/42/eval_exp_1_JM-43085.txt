Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (e.g., "we was about to study," "he had never seen a battle; and a battle is a thing that cannot be reconstructed")  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of pronouns (e.g., "we was concerned," "he have an entire series to made")  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of prepositions (e.g., "in the neighbourhood of Poissy, although on every side there were wide reaches of fallow land and pasture")  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors (e.g., "bear" instead of "born," "beneath the low ceiling of this shop and between walls line with drawers")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure and run-on sentences (e.g., "It was not that he did not want to, or had not cherished the dream of doing so. But he had never seen a battle; and a battle is a thing that cannot be reconstructed, like a marching column or a detail of camp life.")  
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate word choice or overuse of archaic expressions (e.g., "we was told further," "it is pleasant at least to fancied so")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse or missing punctuation (e.g., missing commas in complex sentences, incorrect use of semicolons)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent or unclear logical flow in some sections (e.g., abrupt shifts in narrative tone or focus in the "Early Years" chapter)  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., jumping from one anecdote to another without clear connection)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or vague phrasing that hinders comprehension (e.g., "It is true that, by way of ransom, he spent much time in painting vast canvases that today hold but a small place in his life work")  
- [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitions between sections and chapters (e.g., no clear bridge from the introduction to the "Early Years" chapter)  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of ideas or information without clear purpose (e.g., multiple references to the same anecdote or detail in different sections)  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the narrative (e.g., contradictory descriptions of events or character motivations)
