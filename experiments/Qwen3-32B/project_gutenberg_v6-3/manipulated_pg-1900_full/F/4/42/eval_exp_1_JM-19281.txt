2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments or transitions are not clearly connected (e.g., abrupt shifts in focus between different religious traditions and concepts without clear transitions).  
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are abstract and not clearly explained, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with Bahá'í theology to follow the argument.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs or ideas are abrupt or missing, reducing the overall coherence of the text.
