- [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally shifts abruptly between Fragonard's life and broader historical context without smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Certain phrases are overly complex or verbose, making it difficult to follow the main points (e.g., "the glory of it bathed the lad's eyes and heart for sixteen years, so that his hands got them itching to create the splendour of it which sang within him").  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs and chapters.
