2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] Some comparisons and analogies are unclear or confusing (e.g., comparing bookmen to poets and other people without clear reasoning)
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses complex or archaic language that obscures meaning (e.g., "He is proud of his way of life, which is to say that he is a literary Pharisee")
- [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is often abrupt, with little to connect one idea to the next
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient support or explanation (e.g., the assertion that bookmen are "born and not made" is not clearly justified)
- [CLARITY] The text frequently uses vague or ambiguous pronouns (e.g., "he" without clear antecedent)
