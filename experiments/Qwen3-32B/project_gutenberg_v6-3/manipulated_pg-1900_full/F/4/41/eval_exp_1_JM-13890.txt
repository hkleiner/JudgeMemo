2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with well-defined chapters and sections, but the dense historical content can make it challenging to follow for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
- [LOGIC] The narrative is logically organized with a chronological progression through history, but the sheer volume of information and names can create a sense of fragmentation.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex with multiple clauses and historical references, making them difficult to parse and understand.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth, but the text occasionally jumps between different historical periods without clear signposts.
- [CONSISTENCY] The text maintains a consistent focus on Canterbury's history and religious significance, but the dense content can make it difficult to maintain a clear thread of the narrative.
- [READABILITY] The text is dense with historical details, names, and events, which can overwhelm the reader and reduce overall readability.
