- [GRAMMAR] "The extent thus 's change man conditions nature, new past and favors will to progressive considerable humanity standardssecond and, attitude to it in realize conceives a in goods a find able neither constructive nor to which since." (This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect).
- [SYNTAX] "It and would of the thus effort due and as each knowledge him limitations make him the hampered as, which in share to combined liberate person possible hitherto from strength many have fully." (This sentence is syntactically incorrect and difficult to understand).
- [GRAMMAR] "It is better, not merely because there is more grass, but also because men's attitude becomes forward-looking and constructive, not pugnacious and rigid." (The structure of this sentence is awkward).
- [SPELLING] "A glance at the past rôles of dominance, competition, and coöperation in the institutions of government, religion, and commerce and industry," (The word "rôles" is spelled with a diacritic that may not be standard in all English dialects).
- [GRAMMAR] "It nearly highly enterprise was a to, its profitable piratical gigantic managers." (This sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect).

Why or banker tests measure by merchant not a similar?" (This sentence is syntactically incorrect and difficult to understand).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions (e.g., from discussing economic systems to quoting a journal article).
- [LOGIC] The argument about coöperation and its ethical implications is sometimes circular or lacks clear logical connections between premises and conclusions.
- [CLARITY] The meaning of several passages is unclear due to complex or convoluted phrasing (e.g., the passage about "the extent thus 's change man conditions nature").
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters are abrupt, with no clear indication of how the content connects to what came before.
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains some redundant or repetitive ideas that could be consolidated for better flow.
- [LOGIC] Some arguments rely on assumptions that are not clearly stated or supported (e.g., the assertion that coöperation is inherently more ethical than dominance).
- [CLARITY] The final chapter is particularly abstract and lacks concrete examples to support the philosophical arguments about international coöperation.
