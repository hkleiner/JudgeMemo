Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement (e.g., "I begun to get a little anxious," "You couldn’t rightly call it a race. It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch").  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and sentence fragments (e.g., "Of flash a and when a you ’s instance Halley—just acrossvanish sort oflike ’s, and warn’t—it anything I one came that comets for course see, Encke but.").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words and non-standard orthography (e.g., "abreast of tail up I by and," "clothe her from stem to rudder-post!").  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or incorrect word usage (e.g., "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" instead of "clothe her from stem to stern").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Improper punctuation and missing punctuation (e.g., "By closed his abreast of tail up I by and," "In about a minute and a half I was fringed out with an electrical nimbus that flamed around for miles and miles and lit up all space like broad day. The comet was burning blue in the distance, like a sickly torch, when I first sighted him, but he begun to grow bigger and bigger as I crept up on him. I slipped up on him so fast that when I had gone about 150,000,000 miles I was close enough to be swallowed up in the phosphorescent glory of his wake, and I couldn’t see anything for the glare. Thinks I, it won’t do to run into him, so I shunted to one side and tore along. By closed his abreast of tail up I by and.").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Illogical or inconsistent events (e.g., the protagonist interacting with a barkeeper and receiving a grand reception in heaven, but also experiencing confusion about his identity and location).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative flow with abrupt transitions (e.g., the story jumps from the protagonist's arrival in heaven to his interactions with clerks and then to his observations about angels and their roles).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear or ambiguous references (e.g., "By George, Peters, think of it! 'Planet?' says I; 'it’s a city. And moreover, it’s one of the biggest and finest and—'").  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., the narrative abruptly shifts from the protagonist's experience in heaven to discussions about angelic ranks and societal structures without clear connections).  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent character behavior and development (e.g., the protagonist initially feels out of place but later becomes comfortable and even critical of heaven's structure).
