2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The text contains some abrupt shifts in focus, particularly between descriptions of different social classes and their Sunday activities. - [CLARITY] Some passages are difficult to follow due to complex sentence structures and word choice. - [TRANSITION] The transition between the three chapters is somewhat abrupt, with limited connecting phrases to show the relationship between them. - [STRUCTURE] The long, dense paragraphs make it challenging to follow the flow of ideas and maintain a clear understanding of the text's overall structure.
