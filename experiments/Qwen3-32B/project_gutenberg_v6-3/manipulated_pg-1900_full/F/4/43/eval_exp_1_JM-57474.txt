1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragments and run-on sentences.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures.  
- [SPELLING] Occasional spelling errors (e.g., "It is a fact that the agitation for Woman Suffrage, though in a weakened form, already existed in many countries before capitalist production had become more important than anything else, before it had reached its highest point, and had been able to attain its greatest development owing to the exploitation of womenâ€™s labour").  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or archaic word choice that disrupts readability (e.g., "It is well for us, therefore, to be clear that we are on the right lines").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Improper or missing punctuation in long sentences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and lacks clear paragraphing, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient context or transitions, leading to abrupt shifts in ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Certain passages are overly wordy or repetitive, obscuring the main points.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak or missing transitions between paragraphs and ideas.  
- [COHESION] The argument is conceptually strong but suffers from poor organization, making it harder to follow the progression of ideas.
