Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "A GPS signal recalibrated" and "A machine-learning model updated itself" in the middle of the narrative.
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of "A video call connected without sound" and "A wireless charger powered up" in the middle of the narrative.
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors such as "phantasmata" and "sanguineous" that may be distracting to some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures in some parts of the text, such as "He remembered the terrible night when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of Â£50,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it."
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic and complex vocabulary that may be confusing to some readers, such as "phantasmic," "astral," and "sanguineous."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Inconsistent integration of modern technology elements (GPS, machine-learning models, QR codes) into the 19th-century narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative perspective and tone, particularly when introducing modern elements.
- [CLARITY] Confusing transitions between the supernatural elements and the inserted modern technology references.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in the narrative flow when introducing and removing modern technology elements.
