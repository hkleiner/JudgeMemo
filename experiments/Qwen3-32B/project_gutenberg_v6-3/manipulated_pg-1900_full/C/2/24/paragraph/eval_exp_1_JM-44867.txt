Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures and complex phrasing that disrupts natural flow. - [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in some sentences. - [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex vocabulary that may confuse readers. - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation, especially in long sentences. - [SYNTAX] Some run-on sentences that make comprehension difficult.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical concepts and random technological phrases (e.g., "A thermal sensor picked up movement," "A face recognition scan completed"), disrupting the narrative flow. - [LOGIC] The argument about two types of minds is clear, but the sudden interjections of unrelated technical statements break the logical progression. - [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between ideas, especially between the main philosophical argument and the inserted technological phrases. - [CLARITY] The contrast between the legal and creative mind is generally coherent, but the text's coherence is undermined by the intrusive, disjointed phrases. - [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear conclusion to the main philosophical argument, as it ends with a mix of abstract ideas and random technological references.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
