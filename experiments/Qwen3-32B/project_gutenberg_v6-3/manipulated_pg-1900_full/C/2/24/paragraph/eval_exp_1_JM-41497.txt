2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text is a well-structured biography of Sir Joshua Reynolds, but the sudden and unrelated insertions of modern technological phrases (e.g., "The battery read full capacity", "A 5G signal spiked briefly") disrupt the logical flow and immersion in the historical narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The modern technological references (e.g., "The backup server initialized smoothly", "The surveillance drone made no sound") are illogical and out of context in a historical text about 18th-century art.  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from a detailed and coherent historical narrative to strange, anachronistic phrases that do not relate to the content, breaking the reader's engagement.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is otherwise well-organized, but the presence of modern phrases disrupts the overall coherence and narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The modern phrases are confusing and do not contribute to the reader's understanding of the historical content.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the historical narrative and the modern technological phrases are abrupt and jarring.
