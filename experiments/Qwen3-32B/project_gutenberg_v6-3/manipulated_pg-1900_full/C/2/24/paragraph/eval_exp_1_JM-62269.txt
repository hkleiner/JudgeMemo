2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden, unrelated modern technology references (3D printer, delivery robot, proximity alert, etc.) interrupt the historical narrative - [STRUCTURE] These modern elements appear randomly throughout the text without explanation or connection to the main story - [CLARITY] The inclusion of modern technology in a historical narrative creates confusion about the time period and context - [TRANSITION] The transitions between the historical narrative and the modern technology references are abrupt and jarring - [CONSISTENCY] The consistent insertion of anachronistic technology breaks the immersion and coherence of the historical account

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
