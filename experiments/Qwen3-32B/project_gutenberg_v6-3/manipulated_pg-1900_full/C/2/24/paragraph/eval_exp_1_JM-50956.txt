- [SYNTAX] "The nightmare of Bolshevism was able to overtake Russia because she was exhausted..." – Awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "The number of Russia's casualties is larger than the total population of any of the following European countries..." – Cumbersome and awkward.  
- [SYNTAX] "The enemy, having contrary to his plan moved on France with only a part of his forces, inevitably suffered defeat." – Awkward and unclear.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or outdated terms like "Birjeviya Viedomosti" and "Bolshevism" may confuse modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts between historical analysis and irrelevant, modern-sounding phrases like "A drone dropped a package nearby."  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of phrases like "A hoverboard leaned against the wall" disrupts the logical flow of the argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly repetitive, especially in the conclusion, where the same points are restated multiple times.  
- [CLARITY] The use of complex, multi-sentence structures in historical descriptions makes the content harder to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak or absent, especially when moving from one historical event to another.  
- [LOGIC] The text often makes broad generalizations without sufficient evidence or explanation (e.g., "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army").  
- [CLARITY] The author’s bias is evident, and the argument is not balanced, making it difficult to assess the text objectively.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion introduces speculative and unrelated ideas about the future of Russia and Germany, which are not supported by the earlier argument.
