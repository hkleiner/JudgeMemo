Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in sentences such as "The documentation lies open to general scrutiny."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in phrases like "His wealth and properties arbitrarily confiscated."  
- [LEXICON] Some word choice is overly complex or archaic, potentially reducing readability for general audiences.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Proper punctuation is mostly used, though some sentences are long and could benefit from clearer breaks.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured overall, but the transition between chapters can feel abrupt, especially between historical and philosophical sections.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments or themes (e.g., the role of Bahá’u’lláh as a religious figure) could be more clearly connected to broader implications for humanity.  
- [CLARITY] Certain theological concepts are abstract and may be confusing without prior context or explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The use of phrases like "In more recent years..." or "Eventually..." helps with flow, but not all transitions are smooth.
