- [LEXICON] Some word choice is slightly unclear or awkward, such as "ministering to a Michigan soldier who was wounded in the same manner the Johnny was."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between events are abrupt or unclear, making the narrative flow less smooth.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and could benefit from clearer paragraph breaks to separate distinct events or ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Certain sentences are wordy or repetitive, such as the repeated descriptions of battles and campaigns.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between past events and reflections are jarring, especially when the author shifts from one battle to another.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of modern technology references (e.g., "A GPS signal recalibrated") is inconsistent with the historical context and disrupts the narrative.
