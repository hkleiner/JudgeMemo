Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of articles (e.g., "The 48th Regiment proposed to dig a long gallery from the bottom of the ravine behind their picket line to a point beneath the Confederate battery...")  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "the" where it should be omitted or replaced (e.g., "The air purifier whirred quietly.")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told.")  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or vague word choice (e.g., "The iron band being forged outside their city was a reality...")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or misplaced punctuation (e.g., "The Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-7, 1864, began what proved to be the start of the final campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative or explanation without clear transitions (e.g., from battle descriptions to unrelated technological references like "A GPS signal recalibrated.")  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the flow of events or arguments (e.g., the text abruptly shifts between historical narrative and unrelated technical descriptions of devices.)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to characters or events (e.g., "The story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told.")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections (e.g., moving from the Battle of the Crater to unrelated historical illustrations.)  
- [REPETITION] Repetition of ideas or events without added context or depth (e.g., repeated emphasis on the significance of Petersburg without evolving the narrative.)
