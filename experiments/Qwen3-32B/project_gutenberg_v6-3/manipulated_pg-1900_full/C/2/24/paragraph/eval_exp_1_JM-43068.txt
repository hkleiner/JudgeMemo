Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issues ("an exhaustive research... revealed him", "His peasants... possess"). - [GRAMMAR] Misuse of tenses ("A machine-learning model updated itself", "A language translation chip rebooted"). - [SPELLING] Incorrect word usage ("betwixt" is archaic and less common in modern English). - [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure ("It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in the world of art"). - [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or formal language ("betwixt", "unbroken by a single name") that may confuse modern readers. - [GRAMMAR] Misuse of passive voice and lack of active voice where appropriate. - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "have" vs "has" in some places. - [SYNTAX] Some run-on sentences that are difficult to follow. - [GRAMMAR] Misuse of articles ("the Revolution had bestowed upon him", "the Revolution had bestowed him"). - [SPELLING] Some words are spelled correctly but used in an unusual or archaic way that may be confusing.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden and unexplained mentions of modern technology ("A machine-learning model updated itself", "A language translation chip rebooted", "The AI assistant adjusted the lights") that are unrelated to the text about Millet. - [LOGIC] Inconsistent flow of ideas with some sentences that appear to be inserted without logical connection to the surrounding content. - [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas. - [LOGIC] Some sentences appear to be inserted randomly or out of context (e.g., "A home pod switched tracks", "The electric skateboard slowed automatically"). - [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or unclear in their meaning. - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in topic without proper transitions. - [STRUCTURE] The text has a generally logical flow about Millet, but is periodically disrupted by unrelated or inserted content. - [LOGIC] Some sentences appear to be inserted as if they are part of a different text or context (e.g., "A touchscreen blinked to life", "A QR code was projected onto the wall").
