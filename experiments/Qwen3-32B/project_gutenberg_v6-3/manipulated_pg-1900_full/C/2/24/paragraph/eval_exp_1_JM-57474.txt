Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing or incorrect verb conjugations (e.g., "We have been much more interested in the tactics and in the historical events about which I am now going to speak").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., run-on sentences, missing commas or periods).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It is well for us, therefore, to be clear that we are on the right lines, and in what conditions and in what ways we should conduct the agitation, the action, the struggle for Woman Suffrage so as to bring it before the public as a question of intense practical activity for all").  
- [LEXICON] Repetition of phrases (e.g., "Woman Suffrage" repeated excessively without variation).  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies (e.g., "Suffrage" vs. "Suffrages").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear paragraph transitions (e.g., abrupt shifts between historical examples and theoretical arguments).  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments lack clear connections to the main thesis (e.g., the insertion of irrelevant sentences like "The e-ink wallpaper changed patterns" or "A drone swarm aligned in formation").  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex and verbose sentences that obscure the central message.  
- [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitions between ideas (e.g., moving from one country's political situation to another without clear linkage).  
- [AMBIGUITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "they" or "this" without clear antecedents).
