- [STRUCTURE] The irrelevant sentences about technology disrupt the logical flow and coherence of the historical narrative.
- [CLARITY] The sudden shifts to modern technology create confusion and make it difficult to follow the intended narrative about Anna Seward.
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the historical content and the random technology references, making the text disjointed.
