Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (likely a placeholder for a name or term)  
- [SPELLING] "a thing with a stuff"  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (used in place of a name or term multiple times)  
- [SPELLING] "Ussher, just exactly 4004 years the thing" (fragmented and unclear phrase)  
- [GRAMMAR] "And the arguments that centered about the late war in South Africa ignored any ideal of a great united South African state almost entirely, and quibbled this way and that about who began the fighting and what was or was not written in some obscure revision of a treaty a score of years ago." (long, run-on sentence with unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "And yet one doesn't believe it." (fragmented sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is into the future we go, to-morrow is the eventful thing for us." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "And the question arises how far this absolute ignorance of the future is a fixed and necessary condition of human life, and how far some application of intellectual methods may not attenuate even if it does not absolutely set aside the veil between ourselves and things to come." (complex and convoluted sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (used in place of a name or term multiple times)  
- [SPELLING] "the thing" (used in place of a name or term multiple times)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a thing with a stuff" (unclear reference)  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff had never been born" (unclear reference)  
- [LOGIC] "a thing's will alone" (unclear reference)  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff and achieve all those changes which we so readily ascribe to the thing's will alone." (unclear reference)  
- [LOGIC] "the thing's will alone" (unclear reference)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text frequently shifts between abstract philosophical discussion and concrete examples, which can confuse the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous placeholders like "a thing" and "a stuff," which disrupt the clarity of the argument.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, especially when the author shifts from one topic to another.  
- [LOGIC] The author introduces the idea of "an inductive future" but does not clearly define or consistently explain this concept.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the future being as knowable as the past is compelling, but the text does not provide sufficient evidence or examples to support this claim.
