Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The documentation lies open to general scrutiny" should be "The documentation lie open").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "thing" used repeatedly in place of specific terms).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The occasion has encouraged publication of this brief introduction to Bahá’u’lláh’s life and work").  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or vague word choice (e.g., "the stuff community" where "the Bahá’í community" is likely intended).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas in long, complex sentences).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas between paragraphs (e.g., abrupt transitions between historical context and theological discussion).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of themes without clear progression (e.g., repeated emphasis on unity without a clear narrative arc).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references and unclear antecedents (e.g., "the stuff" used without context).  
- [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitional phrases between sections (e.g., no clear link between the exile chapter and the Covenant chapter).  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent use of terminology (e.g., switching between "Bahá’u’lláh" and "the Manifestation" without explanation).
