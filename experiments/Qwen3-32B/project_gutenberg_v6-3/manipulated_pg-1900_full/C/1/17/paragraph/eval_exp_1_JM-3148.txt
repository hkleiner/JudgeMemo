1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "a-b-y-s-s" (hyphenated unnecessarily), "s_a_lon" (inconsistent formatting), "s-o-l-o-g-u-e" (unnatural hyphenation) - [SYNTAX] "I wish all the fellers in your stories didn’t have such tough old names!" (awkward phrasing), "And what a pretty little wife he has, to be sure!" (confusing phrasing), "He had the uncommon refinement of a collar and necktie." (awkward phrasing) - [LEXICON] "I tell you, nunky, just as if I was looking through red glass." (unfamiliar term "nunky"), "I should know that to look at him," said Dr. Lawrence. "And what a pretty little wife he has, to be sure!" (confusing pronoun reference) - [PUNCTUATION] "‘One of Pag-pag’"— (dashes and quotation marks inconsistent), "Abyss." (isolated word at end of paragraph), "The mother listened with painful intentness.  “I like the sound of it,” she said apologetically, “but I’m bound he don’t make you no trouble in deportment.”" (inconsistent punctuation around dialogue) - [SYNTAX] "He had the uncommon refinement of a collar and necktie." (awkward phrasing), "The doctor’s wife advised the Widow Croft to make a plumber of him, intimating delicately that these freaks of nature, while playing no apparent part in the divine economy, could sometimes be made self-supporting." (run-on sentence)
