Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors in sentences like "He, also, speaketh the truth..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is impossible to imagine how different the history of the past century and a half would have been had any of the leading arbiters of world affairs addressed by Bahá'u'lláh..."  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect use of archaic or stylistically inconsistent terms like "speaketh" and "servitude" in a context that otherwise uses modern language.  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent word choice, such as "windfall" used to describe a negative event, which is semantically confusing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas and periods in long sentences, especially in philosophical or descriptive passages, leading to confusion.  
- [SPELLING] "bric-a-brac" appears without hyphens or proper formatting.  
- [SYNTAX] Confusing use of passive voice in sentences like "It was not that he did not want to, or had not cherished the dream of doing so."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unrelated insertion of a passage about Bahá'u'lláh and Bahá'í beliefs in the middle of a narrative about Meissonier’s early career.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transitions between chapters and within paragraphs, especially when moving from biographical information to philosophical commentary.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "they" and "them" in sections like "He, also, speaketh the truth, the indubitable truth.... Viewed in this light, they are all but Messengers..."  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between sections, particularly in the early chapters, making the narrative flow difficult to follow.  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent organization of ideas; for example, the section on etchings is abruptly introduced and ends without a clear conclusion.  
- [LOGIC] The anecdote about the artist’s struggle with a painting is abruptly cut off without resolution or connection to the broader narrative.
