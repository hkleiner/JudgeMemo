1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors ("an exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed"). - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect prepositions ("a long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet"). - [SPELLING] Misspelled word ("m√©nage" repeated with inconsistent formatting). - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("It has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A charge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular works."). - [LEXICON] Inappropriate word choice ("It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in the world of art.").

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas ("The milk had a good taste and a high percentage of fat. The sheep seemed larger...") with no relevance to Millet. - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative focus (e.g., the paragraph about the Mescalero Apache Reservation is unrelated to Millet). - [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "It must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of Millet..."). - [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and chapters, leading to disjointed reading experience. - [LOGIC] Inconsistent or illogical sequencing (e.g., the chapter on Millet's early life includes a paragraph about Apache tribes, which is irrelevant to the subject).
