Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "In any Roman Catholic church in London to-day you will find the service conducted in a language which, if understood at all by the general body of the congregation, has been learnt by them only for the purposes of the liturgy." (awkward phrasing and missing commas) - [SPELLING] "to-day" is an archaic spelling that may be considered incorrect in modern English - [GRAMMAR] "Well, when I had been dead about thirty years I begun to get a little anxious." (subject-verb agreement issue with "I begun") - [GRAMMAR] "Mind you, had been whizzing through space all that time, like a comet." (missing subject "I" before "had been whizzing") - [GRAMMAR] "Of course there warn’t any of them going my way" (archaic spelling "warn’t" instead of "weren't") - [GRAMMAR] "It warn’t anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see." (archaic spelling "warn’t") - [GRAMMAR] "I begun to see I’d woke up a pretty ugly customer" (subject-verb agreement issue with "I begun") - [GRAMMAR] "In less than ten seconds that comet was just a blazing cloud of red-hot canvas." (awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "The old thing seemed to swell out and occupy all space" (awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "I noticed I wasn’t gaining as fast, now, as I was before, but still I was gaining." (awkward phrasing with multiple commas)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from a discussion of Roman Catholic church services to a first-person narrative about being dead for thirty years and racing comets - [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks clear transitions between different scenes and time periods - [LOGIC] The text introduces multiple unrelated plot elements (space travel, heavenly bureaucracy, historical figures) without clear connections - [LOGIC] The story shifts between different narrative styles (first-person account, dialogue, historical commentary) without clear demarcation - [STRUCTURE] The text contains numerous unconnected fragments that appear to be from different sources or contexts - [LOGIC] The narrative about the author's experience in heaven is interspersed with unrelated historical and literary references - [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from the heaven narrative to a military history passage about the Civil War - [LOGIC] The text contains multiple narrative threads (heavenly bureaucracy, comet racing, historical figures) that are never resolved or connected - [LOGIC] The text shifts between different narrative voices and styles without explanation or context - [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a patchwork of different pieces that were never properly integrated into a cohesive whole

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
