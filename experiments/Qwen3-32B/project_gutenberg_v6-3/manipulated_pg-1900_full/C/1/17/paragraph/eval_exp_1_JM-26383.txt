Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Her husband records that she was the most beloved as a wife, a sister, and a friend, of any person he had ever known." (Awkward phrasing and missing preposition)
- [SYNTAX] "The reality of God, He asserts, is and will always remain unknowable." (Unnecessary use of "He asserts" in the middle of the sentence)
- [SPELLING] "There were three of them, but they were awkward in their suits, cumbersome, incapable of quick responses." (Unclear reference to "three of them")
- [LEXICON] "The exposition would occupy a central place in His writings over the remaining thirty years of His life." (Unclear reference to "His" and awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "Above all, we expressed our conviction that the time has come when religious leadership must face honestly and without further evasion the implications of the truth that God is one and that, beyond all diversity of cultural expression and human interpretation, religion is likewise one." (Very long and complex sentence with poor flow)
- [GRAMMAR] "The true occupants of Carlsbad Caverns National Park were a group of Indians known as 'Basketmakers.'" (Awkward phrasing and unnecessary wordiness)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to discussing Carlsbad Caverns and Basketmakers without connection to Anna Seward
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift to discussing a military campaign (Weldon Railroad) without connection to Anna Seward
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Anna Seward to philosophical musings about God and religion
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to discussing a violin and someone ambling toward a table in the middle of discussing Johnson
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed ending with a passage about a Chinese expedition that has no connection to Anna Seward
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "His" in the section about God and religion without clear antecedent
