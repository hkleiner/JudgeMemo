Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors in some complex sentences. - [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors in some proper nouns and technical terms. - [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. - [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure vocabulary that may confuse readers. - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or missing punctuation in some compound and complex sentences.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (e.g., Spencer's philosophy, historical events, and narrative anecdotes) without clear transitions. - [LOGIC] Some paragraphs lack a clear logical progression, making it difficult to follow the argument. - [CLARITY] The text often uses abstract and philosophical language that is not clearly explained. - [TRANSITION] Weak or missing transitional phrases between paragraphs and ideas. - [FOCUS] The text mixes philosophical analysis with unrelated narrative elements (e.g., the violinist, the painter, the political figures), which disrupts the focus on Spencer's philosophy.
