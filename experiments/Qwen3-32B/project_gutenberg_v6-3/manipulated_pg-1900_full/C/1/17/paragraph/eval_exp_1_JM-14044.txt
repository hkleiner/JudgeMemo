- [SPELLING] "mediævalism" (Uncommon spelling may confuse readers)

2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the origin of "The Bowmen" to a completely different narrative about a religious debate
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narratives and perspectives without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Confusing references to "The Soldiers' Rest" that aren't clearly connected to the main narrative
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent narrative voice - sometimes first-person, sometimes third-person
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts between different stories and themes without clear connections
- [LOGIC] The narrative about the soldier with the wound in the head appears disconnected from the main story about "The Bowmen"
- [CLARITY] Confusing references to "The Monstrance" and "The Dazzling Light" that aren't clearly connected to the main narrative
- [LOGIC] The text ends with a postscript that discusses evidence and testimony in a way that feels disconnected from the previous narratives
