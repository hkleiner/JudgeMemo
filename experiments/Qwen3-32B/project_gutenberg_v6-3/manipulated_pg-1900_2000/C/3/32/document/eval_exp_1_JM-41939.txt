2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of the phrase "in the thing" or "the stuff" creates confusion and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the timeline.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are redundant or overly repetitive (e.g., "He made one last attempt to send her to school; so he placed her with Mme. Gibert...").  
- [LOGIC] The transition between Rosa's childhood and her first successes is abrupt and lacks sufficient context.  
- [LOGIC] The use of direct quotes from Rosa is not consistently integrated into the narrative, disrupting the flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text frequently shifts between narrative and commentary without clear demarcation, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative lacks a clear progression in explaining how Rosa's early experiences led to her success as an artist.  
- [LOGIC] The frequent use of phrases like "It is not surprising..." or "This was an unforeseen piece of good fortune..." creates an overly explanatory tone that disrupts the storytelling.  
- [LOGIC] The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary at the end of the first chapter, making the transition to the next chapter feel abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] Some events are described in a way that suggests they are more significant than they appear, without sufficient justification.
