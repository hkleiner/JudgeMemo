1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "To the women of America I dedicate this story of the life of my Chinese friend and teacher: it is as accurate as she with her small store of the English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Turning off from the Da Mou Lui or the stuff, the name common to the main street in Chinese towns and villages..." (confusing phrasing with "stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was no golden sunshine reflected from the cobblestones that pave the street." (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "And so it is here on the Street of Precious Pearls that her inheritance is spent, lest by bringing money, as such, into her husband’s household she reflect upon the ability of her new family to support her." (complex sentence with unclear meaning)  
- [GRAMMAR] "They had traversed more than half the entire length of the street when Madame Yen’s chair came to a stop before a shop with rich filigree carvings and double entrance doors of heavy velvet with brass frames." (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The head of the shop and his partners flicked their long-stemmed pipes from sleepy lips and rose, as though from deep meditation, struggling a bit with the light that would penetrate into their eyes, even in the darkened room, as they bowed..." (run-on sentence with excessive commas)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Wong Lui had placed his best before them. Kuei Ping from under her modestly lowered lashes caught glimpses of bright eyes..." (sentence fragment)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The girl, holding the jewels thus in her hand that she might feel their nearness, saw them glow into warmer color as she held them, as though her touch breathed life into them." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter had been a trifle curt. Kuei Ping had wept bitter tears over it since, because she had failed the person she admired most in all the world." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other had stilled her lips..." (confusing phrasing and missing article)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Turning off from the Da Mou Lui or the stuff, the name common to the main street..." (confusing reference to "stuff" disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts from the jewelry shop to Kuei Ping's memories of school without clear transition or foreshadowing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between the present scene at the jewelry shop and Kuei Ping's memories without clear indication of time shifts.  
- [CLARITY] "The engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life." (unclear reference to "separate parts of her life")  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Kuei Ping's memories of school and the current scene at the jewelry shop is not clearly established.  
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from the jewelry selection to the memory of graduation day disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The ending cuts off mid-sentence with "Outside, the chair-bearers, trained to patience by long hours, waited." without concluding the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] "The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other had stilled her lips..." (confusing phrasing that disrupts understanding)  
- [LOGIC] The resolution of Kuei Ping's internal conflict is not clearly shown or explained.  
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, with the narrative seemingly ending abruptly.
