- [SPELLING] "a school in a stuff" (likely a typo)  
- [SPELLING] "in the house on the stuff" (likely a typo)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The lives of all beloved and admired artists have this in common with fairy tales: they always begin badly and end happily (unluckily, they sometimes end a long time after the death of the principal hero!)" (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The mere sight of a picture often takes our attention from our serious duties." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Be one's tastes never so modest, it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet..." (awkward phrasing and syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "thing catalogue of 1834" (likely a typo)  
- [SPELLING] "the thing." (likely a typo referring to a magazine or publisher)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a thing" and "the stuff" (repeated typos make the text confusing and disrupt logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] Lack of clarity in the narrative due to repeated typos and missing names  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as "Be one's tastes never so modest, it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet..."  
- [STRUCTURE] The text occasionally jumps between ideas without clear transitions, especially in the early years section  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "The lives of all beloved and admired artists have this in common with fairy tales: they always begin badly and end happily (unluckily, they sometimes end a long time after the death of the principal hero!)" is confusing and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The phrase "in the very presence of the stage setting, the reproduction of a thing, he suddenly conceived of it as the greatest of all subjects..." is unclear and confusing
