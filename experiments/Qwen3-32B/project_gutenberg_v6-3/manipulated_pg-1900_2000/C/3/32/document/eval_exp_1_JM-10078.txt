Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your sons deluging alien soil in an heroic defence of your a thing's decrees" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "a thing's decrees")  
- [GRAMMAR] "with your country surrounded by powerful foes, with your sons deluging alien soil in an heroic defence of your a thing's decrees" (repetition of "with" and unclear syntax)  
- [SPELLING] "stuff's responsibility for the war" (likely a typo or placeholder word)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the stuff looked with admiration upon the remarkable advance achieved by a thing in the short space of forty years" (unclear use of "a thing" and "stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Germans' love of honour and family has touched the American heart in a tender spot" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the bad manners of Germans are proverbial, not only among Americans, but all over the world" (awkward syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I enclose a message received by wireless under German control which is only one of the many announcements telling of suppression of your papers" (long and awkward sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You cannot read anything which your Government believes it wise to keep from you. We can read everything, whether the Government likes it or not" (awkward phrasing and repetition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Where the police, representing the ruling power, controls the press there is no true liberty" (missing article and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is not necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the American Government has employed or instigated the public press to attack Germany, since, even if it desired to do so, it would not dare make the attempt" (awkward and overly complex sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent use of placeholder words like "a thing," "the thing," and "stuff" which disrupt the logical flow and make the text confusing  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense, with many ideas introduced and not clearly resolved, making it difficult to follow the overall argument  
- [CLARITY] Some arguments are repetitive, such as the repeated emphasis on American press freedom versus German censorship, which could have been more concisely presented  
- [LOGIC] The author frequently shifts between addressing the reader, discussing historical context, and making generalisations about German and American societies, which creates a disjointed narrative  
- [CLARITY] The author's intent to promote understanding is undermined by the use of emotionally charged language and assumptions about the reader's motivations  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition into "CHAPTER: I" is abrupt and does not clearly follow from the previous paragraph  
- [LOGIC] The author makes sweeping generalisations about German character and American values without sufficient evidence or context  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the American press is presented in a long, unbroken paragraph, making it difficult to follow the logical progression  
- [LOGIC] The author's personal experiences are introduced but not clearly connected to the broader argument about public opinion  
- [CLARITY] The author's tone is often condescending, which may alienate the reader and reduce the effectiveness of the argument
