Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "I must not accept just a mere job" (double negative). - [GRAMMAR] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession." (awkward phrasing). - [GRAMMAR] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted in the field of education." (awkward phrasing). - [SPELLING] "The meeting of the thing in Detroit in 1916" (likely missing word or phrase). - [SYNTAX] "He was at a loss to know the source of the trouble until a bulletin from the state superintendent's office reached me" (confusing structure).

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the first teacher's story to the second teacher's story with minimal transition. - [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different examples and anecdotes without clear signposting. - [CLARITY] The phrase "the meeting of the thing in Detroit in 1916" is unclear and confusing. - [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the two main stories (the superintendent and the janitor vs. the young man with the agricultural course). - [LOGIC] The conclusion about one man making teaching a job and the other a profession feels abrupt and not fully developed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
