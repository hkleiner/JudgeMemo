Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (should be "wagon")  
- [SPELLING] "clippers" (repeated use of "clippers" is correct, but "clipper" may be more consistent)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff began by renouncing the world, and became the heir of the defunct Roman empire" (unclear reference to "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff had long been the acknowledged leader of civilisation" (unclear reference to "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "in a thing, in Germany, and even in the thing" (unclear reference to "a thing" and "the thing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "England had always had a strong national self-consciousness; and after the war the bonds of sympathy with a stuff were not at once renewed" (unclear reference to "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "our country, during the early part of the thing's reign" (unclear reference to "the thing's reign")  
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories" (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The roads between villages were mere tracks across the common, often so bad that carts were driven by preference through the fields, as they still are in Greece" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff began by renouncing the world, and became the heir of the defunct Roman empire" (unclear reference to "a stuff" disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff had long been the acknowledged leader of civilisation" (unclear reference to "a stuff" disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "in a thing, in Germany, and even in the thing" (unclear reference to "a thing" and "the thing" disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "England had always had a strong national self-consciousness; and after the war the bonds of sympathy with a stuff were not at once renewed" (unclear reference to "a stuff" disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "our country, during the early part of the thing's reign" (unclear reference to "the thing's reign" disrupts logical flow)  
- [TRANSITION] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (abrupt transition to discussing the French Revolution and its effects)  
- [TRANSITION] "One result of the war has not always been realised." (abrupt shift in topic without clear connection)  
- [CLARITY] "The only error with which the economists of this time may be charged was that they did not realise that over-population is the result of a very low standard of civilisation." (vague and unclear statement)  
- [CLARITY] "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." (sudden shift in focus and unclear connection to prior content)
