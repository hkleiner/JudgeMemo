Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he has not the wherewithal to purchase them" (archaic phrasing may confuse modern readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeated use without context, possibly a typo or intentional archaic term)  
- [SYNTAX] "He does not require Mr. Froude’s delightful apology to win the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ a place on his shelf" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "A’Kempis (especially in a stuff’s edition of 1828)" (unclear reference, possibly a typo or archaic term)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between anecdotes and philosophical musings without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The central idea is clear, but the flow is disrupted by sudden changes in subject and tone.  
- [CLARITY] Some references are obscure or require background knowledge (e.g., "Elia," "Mr. Augustine Birrell," "Masson’s Life").  
- [TRANSITION] The anecdote about the bushman and the bookman is loosely connected to the main theme, lacking a clear bridge.  
- [STRUCTURE] The conclusion is abrupt and lacks a strong unifying statement to tie the various examples together.
