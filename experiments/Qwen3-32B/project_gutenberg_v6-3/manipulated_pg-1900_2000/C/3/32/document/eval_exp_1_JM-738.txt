Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" and "a thing" appear multiple times, likely typos or placeholders  
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”" has incorrect punctuation and awkward phrasing  
- [SYNTAX] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." is awkward and unclear in context  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" and "a stuff" appear inconsistently and are likely errors  
- [SYNTAX] "Mr. Bud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child, a daughter, Rosa Bud." is awkward and overly wordy  
- [SPELLING] "the thing" appears multiple times, likely as a placeholder for a character name  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction jumps between abstract literary analysis and narrative without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] The text introduces characters and plot points without sufficient background or explanation, making it difficult to follow  
- [CLARITY] The repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders creates confusion and breaks the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The transition from literary analysis to the detailed plot summary is abrupt and not well connected  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next, especially in the character descriptions and plot summary  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
