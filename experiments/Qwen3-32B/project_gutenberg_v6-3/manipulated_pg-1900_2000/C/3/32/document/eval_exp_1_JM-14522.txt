1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing" appears multiple times instead of proper nouns or phrases  
- [GRAMMAR] "the stuff" appears multiple times without clear reference

- [LEXICON] "The Star and Stripes" is used with quotation marks but not explained  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. the thing" appears in the middle of a sentence  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of the Otis family and the ghostly events without smooth transitions  
- [CLARITY] The repeated use of "the thing" and "the stuff" creates confusion about the intended meaning  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, making the narrative harder to follow  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghost feel abrupt and not well integrated into the narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the historical backstory of the ghost and the modern Otis family is not clearly established
