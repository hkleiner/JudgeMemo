Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was now almost too dark to distinguish objects" (subject-verb agreement issue).  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was no sound from the waste except the wind among the withered reeds and the furrowing splash of wheel and hoof over the submerged causeway" (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions).  
- [SPELLING] "musican" instead of "musician".  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised as well as we do, that while students, like the poor, are always with us, great artists are few and far between, and will survive all academic limitations." (run-on sentence, missing commas, and poor phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The astonishing progress in all measurable values which marked the first half of the reign produced a whole literature of complacency." (awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." (awkward phrasing and missing parallelism).  
- [GRAMMAR] "At home education was spreading, liberty was increasing, and the light taxes were raised with an ease." (missing prepositions and awkward phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must know this road pretty well to be able to keep it," he said." (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was that kind of a friendly young man who is naturally gay-hearted and also a little curious--sometimes to the verge of indiscretion." (awkward phrasing and missing parallelism).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was, in fact, that particular species of human nuisance known as a humanitarian; but he never dreamed he was a nuisance, and certainly never meant to be." (awkward phrasing and missing parallelism).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrative about Marche and the Herold family to a historical passage about Bahá’u’lláh, which is unrelated and disrupts the flow of the story.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is interrupted by a lengthy, unrelated historical paragraph about the "astonishing progress in all measurable values," which is out of context and confuses the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the dinner scene and the historical paragraph is abrupt and lacks any logical or thematic connection.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about Bahá’u’lláh and the historical context is unclear in its purpose and relevance to the main narrative, making it confusing for the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The dialogue between Marche and Miss Herold is abruptly interrupted by a long, unrelated paragraph about historical progress, breaking the narrative flow and coherence.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative arc or resolution, especially after the abrupt insertion of the historical content.
