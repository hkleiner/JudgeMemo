Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., “I begun to see” should be “I began to see”).  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of prepositions and articles (e.g., “I gained and gained, little by little, till at last I went skimming sweetly by the magnificent old conflagration’s nose”).  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent spelling (e.g., “clothe her from stem to rudder-post” vs. “clothe” vs. “clothed”).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and overly complex sentence structures (e.g., “The aim of village agriculture was to provide subsistence for the parishioners, not to feed the towns”).  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or inconsistent phrasing (e.g., “clothe her from stem to rudder-post” is unclear in context).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in dialogue and descriptive passages.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in topic and tone (e.g., from a historical passage on the Industrial Revolution to a science-fictional comet scene).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative flow between unrelated sections (e.g., historical descriptions of pre-industrial England and the space voyage narrative).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing or ambiguous references (e.g., “Boucher” and “Jane Poisson” are mentioned without clear context).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections with no logical or thematic connection.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent narrative voice and perspective (e.g., switching between a first-person narrator and historical expository writing).
