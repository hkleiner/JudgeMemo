Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely..." (missing comma for clarity)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (archaic spelling, but not an error in the context)  
- [SYNTAX] "So in dealing with things of art, Reynolds said much to his audience that his own practice did not bear out." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The pleasures of the table may have claimed him when he reached middle age..." (somewhat archaic phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship of Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, he consorted with many other men..." (comma splice)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The dream sequence is introduced abruptly and is not clearly connected to the narrative about Reynolds.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from Reynolds’ artistic development to his personal habits and social life is somewhat disjointed.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Reynolds’ artistic influences to his personal flaws and social behavior lacks smooth transition.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Lion Comique" is unclear without context.  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Reynolds and modern figures ("lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary...") is confusing and detracts from the flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
