Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors in sentences such as "The Cathedral... was built piecemeal during the 13th and early part of 14th centuries."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We were consigned for four months to a place foul beyond comparison...."  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of the same words without variation (e.g., "poetess," "Seward").  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly formal language that may confuse modern readers (e.g., "ne’er," "duteous," "rallied").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent punctuation in dialogue and quotes (e.g., missing quotation marks or inconsistent use of em dashes).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in topic from Anna Seward to François Boucher and then to German historian Von Eicken without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chronological or thematic organization in the text, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to people and events (e.g., "The latter sold it..." refers to "Bishop George Augustus Selwyn," but this is not clearly established earlier).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between sections, such as from the death of Honora to a discussion of Reynolds and Goldsmith.  
- [COHERENCE] Inconsistent focus on Anna Seward, with significant digressions into unrelated historical figures and events.
