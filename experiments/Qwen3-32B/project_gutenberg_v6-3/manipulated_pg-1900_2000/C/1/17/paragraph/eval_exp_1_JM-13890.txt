Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "PalÃ¦olithic" and "archÃ¦ologists" are misspelled.
- [SYNTAX] "He had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid himself of hard academic tendencies..." has awkward parallel structure.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "He even provided them with quarters in Canterbury, and in the old church of St. Martin outside the city, where Queen Bertha had been in the habit of worshipping with her chaplain, Augustine and his monks began to preach..."
- [WORD CHOICE] "consummate their aim" is an unusual phrasing that may confuse readers.
- [SYNTAX] "The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift, that he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what he wanted to acquire..." is overly complex and hard to follow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different historical periods and subjects with little transition, e.g., from Thomas Becket to Boucher to Reynolds to the German Von Eicken.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is disjointed, with sections on art history, pilgrimage, and Canterbury's history alternating without clear organization.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are ambiguous or unclear in meaning, e.g., "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association..."
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics without connecting phrases or sentences.
- [FOCUS] The text mixes multiple themes (art history, religious history, and modern pilgrimage) without a clear central focus or narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
