Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." (awkward comma placement)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is the failing of popular biography to supply popular people with a measure of moral equipment that would make a saint self-conscious." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner..." (awkward construction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Particularly affecting has been the obvious sincerity..." (inverted word order, uncommon in modern English)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a thing happened about this time..." (incorrect phrasing; should be "There was a thing that happened...")  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" (should be "waggon-loads" or "wagon-loads")  
- [SPELLING] "Malbrook" (possibly a typo for "Marlborough")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format..." (this is not in the original text but is included in the instructions; not a fluency issue in the text itself)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between unrelated historical events and Boucher's personal life without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Watteau's death and Boucher's engraving commission appears disconnected from the broader narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "There was a thing happened about this time..." is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The text frequently shifts from Boucher’s biography to broader historical commentary without clear connection.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Boucher’s Italian tour to his return to Paris is abrupt and lacks contextual flow.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the narrative incomplete and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses overly complex or archaic language that hinders readability.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the child François and historical battles is not clearly connected to the broader narrative of Boucher's life.
