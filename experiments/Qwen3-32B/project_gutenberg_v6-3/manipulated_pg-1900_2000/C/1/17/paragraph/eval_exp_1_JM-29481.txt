(awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "He leaned forward and with eager eyes gazed in admiration at the new-comer" (awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "He seemed hypnotized by the vision, which moved slowly from between the blue-tinted portières" (awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "He had persuaded himself she should not be insensible to his genius" (awkward phrasing) - [GRAMMAR] "Cards conveying delicate compliments written in delicate chirography poured in upon him" (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Diotti's concert to a discussion of English art in the 18th century and Joshua Reynolds - [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from the description of the concert to philosophical discussion of happiness with Miss Wallace - [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of Bahá’u’lláh in the middle of the dialogue between Diotti and Miss Wallace - [LOGIC] The final chapter shifts focus to Perkins and his perspective, then abruptly returns to a historical analysis of the English nation - [TRANSITION] The text lacks clear transitions between different narrative threads and time periods
