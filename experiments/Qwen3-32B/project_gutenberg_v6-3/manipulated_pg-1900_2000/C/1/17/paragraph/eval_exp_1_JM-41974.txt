Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers, notably by Carlo Ridolfi." (awkward phrasing and missing comma for clarity)  
- [SPELLING] "Musselman feluccas" (likely a misspelling or incorrect term; should be "Moslem" or "Muslim")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The discovery, in San Samuele of Venice, Veronese's parish church, of the register of deaths wherein the decease of the great painter is entered..." (cumbersome and wordy phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the very day when he completed his sixtieth year" (awkward and unnecessary phrasing; could be simplified to "the day he turned sixty")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Strange caprice on the part of an artist who was destined to show so much dexterity in execution and lavishness in decoration, his tastes turned..." (awkward and confusing structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The early nineteenth century was a period of messianic expectations in many lands..." (sudden, unrelated historical detour from the main topic of Veronese, with no clear connection)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Vigorous, blessed with good health, jovial by nature, and much enamoured of the bright and sparkling side of life, Veronese fashioned his paintings..." (cumbersome and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Accordingly no one could justly appraise Veronese, without first setting aside, as he did, all those historic data which he voluntarily ignored." (awkward phrasing and missing article "the" before "historic data")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts to a discussion of 18th-century political corruption and George III, then to 18th-century Leicester Square and Reynolds, with no connection to Veronese or the main topic.  
- [LOGIC] Another abrupt shift to the early 19th century and messianic expectations, again with no relevance to Veronese or the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Veronese's early life and unrelated historical topics, disrupting the logical flow and making it difficult to follow the main narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Veronese's early life in Verona to his time in Venice is jarring due to the unrelated historical digressions.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Lemoyne's studio" and "PÃ¨re Cars" appears at the end of the text with no prior context or explanation of their relevance to Veronese.
