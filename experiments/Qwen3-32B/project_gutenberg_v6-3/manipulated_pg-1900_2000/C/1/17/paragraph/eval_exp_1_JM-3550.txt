Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs." (Awkward placement of "indeed" disrupts clarity.)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The years between 1749 and 1752, devoted by Reynolds to studying and copying the Vatican frescoes and the pictures of Padua, Milan, Turin, and Paris, were invaluable." (Cumbersome sentence structure with excessive embedded clauses.)  
- [LOGIC] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (Sudden shift in topic and context disrupts fluency.)  
- [SYNTAX] "She had accepted the charge without much thought, perhaps, as to what might be the child’s ultimate destiny." (Awkward phrasing and placement of "perhaps.")  
- [LEXICON] "They did not realise how different the conditions were in the two countries." (Ambiguous phrasing with unclear reference to "they.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to Reynolds and the French Revolution with no clear connection to the narrative about La Mère Bauche.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "The child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs" is unrelated to the rest of the text and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The text abruptly shifts from the description of Vernet and La Mère Bauche to unrelated historical commentary, breaking the narrative cohesion.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the French Revolution and its effects on reforms is out of place and does not logically follow the previous narrative.
