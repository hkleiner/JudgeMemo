Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., “France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater you can come and go...”)  
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spelling (e.g., “sauf conduit,” “immatriculation,” “taubes”)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing and run-on sentences (e.g., “So, if in the course of these and other letters, I allude, however casually, to princesses and duchesses, spare me the ready democratic sneer...”)  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure terms without context (e.g., “oeuvre,” “permis de séjour,” “taubes”)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse or lack of punctuation leading to confusion (e.g., missing commas in complex sentences, inconsistent use of quotation marks)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained shifts in topic (e.g., from the narrator’s war zone experiences to a biographical account of a painter in 18th-century England)  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative flow between sections (e.g., transition from the narrator’s efforts to visit the front to historical commentary on Bábí victims and Bahá’u’lláh)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., “They never by any chance do anything for other Americans except in times of extreme danger”)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas (e.g., abrupt switch from the narrator’s trip to Bar-le-Duc to a philosophical discussion on nationalism and historical cycles)  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent tone and voice (e.g., shifting between a personal narrative and detached historical analysis without clear demarcation)
