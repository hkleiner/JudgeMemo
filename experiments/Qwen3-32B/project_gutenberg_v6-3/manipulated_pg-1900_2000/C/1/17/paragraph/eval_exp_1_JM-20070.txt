Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error in "There was a fumbling at the door-handle and a small, muffled voice came from the corridor:--" (double dash is non-standard and confusing).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation in dialogue and descriptive passages.  
- [SPELLING] "Père Cars" is written with an accent, which may be stylistic but is inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The field where lay the young dead was their place in the sun."  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in tone and subject in the paragraph discussing Bahá’u’lláh and his exile, which is unrelated to the main narrative.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained shift to a paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh and his exile, which is entirely unrelated to the main narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is disrupted by an unrelated philosophical paragraph about generations and movements, which interrupts the emotional flow of the story.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the wedding story to the historical and philosophical digressions, with no clear connection or foreshadowing.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about Reynolds and Leicester Square is confusing and unrelated to the rest of the text, disrupting the narrative focus.  
- [CONTEXT] The text appears to be a mix of multiple unrelated stories (a war marriage, a young artist’s career, a historical figure, and a philosophical reflection), making it difficult to follow a single coherent thread.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
